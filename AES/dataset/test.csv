0,"Some people don’t like computers because of instant reason, and other people like computers little too much. I like computers but @CAPS1 not obsess with computers give good efforts on people, even me you can learn things off the computer and you start to get good hand eye coordination one of the things I like about the is that you can 'talk"" to other people. Lots of people uses the computer a little too much that they dont exercise, or watch nature as much some normal (other) people should, and they dont spend them with their familys. I rather spend time on the computer for only (#@NUM1) three hours so then I can do other things with my time and you or anybody should do the same.",4
1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 newspaper, I firmly believe that computers do have a positive benefits on society. These advancements in technology can only enrich peoples lives. One way computer help is that students can do their school work online and see their teachers pages. Another great thing about computers is that whenever people need information or details on any place or things have can count on the internet to help them out. Most importantly they are a vital source of communication. People depend on computers for their scheduling and keeping in touch with everyone that they know. Without computers students would have it a lot worse. When a student forgets the homework, they can just go on their teachers online page and check what he assignment was for that night. Another thing that students benefit from are online textbooks. If a student can't manage to carry home @NUM1 pounds of books they can just use their textbook online. Nowadays, the internet is filled with lots of great information and educational site. Teacher also can allow students to research for projects online and participate in online educational activities. Not only do computer help out educationally' they are probably the must well known information centers. If people want to see about a restaurant, store or product, they can do that online. Also, many people want to go to destinations but do not know how to get there. The internet provides them with directions for them on how to reach their destination in a quick and efficient manner. An extremely important and helpful aspect of the internet is the ability of purchasing and ordering items online. Before someone decides to but something, they can find out all sorts of information about the product and shop around for the lowest price. People can even order groceries to new house if they are busy! I strongly think that the internet is the number one way of communication between people. For example, the team manager of my soccer team always emails me times and locations of the next game or practice. I would be lost and confused without these emails what I depend on. Buisnesses also heavily rely on the internet to keep in touch with their clients that keep them in buisness. The use of web confrences saves a lot of travel and it allows the company to be in buisness with all over the world. Above all, people depend heavily on social networking sites to keep intouch with friends, keep up to date on the news, and have fun talking to people. Without the internet, probably half of the world communications would be down and that would not be good. Computers, without do have positive effect on society. When it can be an educational resource it is very helpful. Also, it is the best information database known to and is probably the most used. Most importantly, wihout computer the world would be a mess without their main source of communications People know not to spend too much time inside and he always know when to go outside have some fun and get some fresh air. Therefore, computers have no negative effect on people and they remain an essential asset in everyday life.",10
2,"Dear newspaper company, More and more people use computers each day. But not every one agrees it benefits society. Some people say the people that are on computers dont get exercise or play outside. Then when they get off the computer their eyes hurt and they cant see as well. But will all that said I agree with the benefits of computers is very well used. The reasons why I agree with computers have benefits is that. It gives you hand-eye coordination give people info on faraway places. They can also rent hotels movies and games. You can even talk to people online from around the world! What if we didn't have computers though then what if a serious crime happend then we wouldn't be able to find the criminals name or his records! Some bad reasons for having computers is a big issue right cyberbullying! Kids might get picked. On and he will. People get called names all the time. Another big problem is online they seem freindly then they try to. There is two big problem with computers its called plagarism. Plagarism is when you take some ones work and put your name on the. It can be also be when you steal and say its yours. The second problem is stealing music getting it for free. By downloading from the internet like lime wire. Then the the song dont get the money from the albums. That is why I agree with computers give you benefits. They give you bad ones to careful when your on a computer.",8
3,"Computers. First of all. I strongly beleave that people should not use computers all the time. Staying up to late, like on a school day and your tired. Your eyes look at black & white words that can make your tired, forcing to stay up, and drinking red bull monster, or any other energy drink when your not suppose to. Second of all, almost the hole school use's the labtops, and the computers like @PERCENT1 use's them. The othe <@PERCENT2@NUM1> is students and adults write on paper, and that has good hand and combination. the @PERCENT1 is like all people go online, facebook, youtube, games, and google. The @PERCENT2 is all people use to write on their paper, and doodle on the back round. Third of all. In other state's people don't have enternet service, or they can't use computer. People have to write their work on a piece of paper. Some kids, youngadults, adults, and students sometimes have bad hand writing. I think all people should not have a computer.",6
4,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effect of computers are that, it depends on how much you use the computer. But I think the computer has a possitive effect on people. Why because it has made us kids homework easier to do, and fun sites you can check out. Even for adults when they need to look up something important they can automatically find it in the computer. First reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is because it makes @CAPS1 homework easier, instead of getting it from a book I can get it from @CAPS1 computer. Trust me it's much easier than reading all those types of books when you have a computer. Then you can just type in what you want and it would automatically pop up for you. For example, when you have an essay to right about @PERSON1 @LOCATION1. All you have to to is go to @CAPS2.com and all types of past @CAPS2 would show up. Then you go to search and put in @LOCATION1 then all this @CAPS2 of him comes out. So you get the right information that's an easy A+ for you. Second reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is all the sites you can go on and play games or go on youtube, or myspace. It's alot of things you can do on a computer to have some fun. For, example, say you don'@CAPS3 want to play your game or watch @CAPS3.V, or go outside. What do you do, get on your computer. So you can check your myspace page or watch funny videos or maybe talk to some of your friends online. Think about it, you can'@CAPS3 do none of those things on your @CAPS3.V or your game and especially not outside so that's why I think a computer has a positive effect on people. Lastly, I think the computer has a positive effect on people because even adults like to get on computers. Half of every adults job has an computer that they have to use either to cash a check on a computer or teachers to put in grades and scientist to look up different experiments. For example a teacher alway's have to use their computer to put in grades or see what us kids need help on or how far we got and how far behind we are. So it makes it easy on adults as well. In conclusion, those were the reasons why I think computers has a positive effect on people.",9
5,"Dear @CAPS1 paper, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I am writing this letter on the count of the computer issue. @CAPS2 look on this subject is the oppisite. People @MONTH1 spend more time on the computer then exercising, but theycould still be social in chat rooms. People can use laptops out doors. You can spread your imagination with the games you can play. Lets get onto @CAPS2 first point, being social. The experts say that people are spending less time with there friends and family then on the computer. They @MONTH1 be spending less time with there friend and family physicly, but who said there not being social. Theres facebook, @CAPS3, and chat rooms. You can talk to your friend on there so they on being social. Not being physicly social but verbily social. On to @CAPS2 next subject the expert say were not enjoying out doors, but the over looked something here it is. If were not enjoying outdoors then half of amarica would be as plae as can be. Then theres laptops. You can use thoughs out doors. People that have laptops can go outside on a sunny day grab some fruit and relax. You could stay out there till the batterie deis. Then just grab the pluge and keep relaxing its easy. Computers also help your imagination. Some computer games help expand your imagination because when your playing games you think of things that could make the game better. Simulaters help you design or even controll things. Some games allow you design and play as a character you created. They help you jobs that you might be intrested in. For me computer games expanded @CAPS2 drawing. All these thing can be reversed. No one is a robot that repeats what they do over and over again. Humanity has the power to get off the computer, and go outside or be social. As I just proved everything you can physicly you can do on the computer.",8
6,"Dear @ORGANIZATION3, In a pole conducted by the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1) @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people agreed that computers are a easier way to research than going to a library. Over the @DATE1 few years it has become a growing debate as to wheather computers are a benifit to socity or not. Today in america over @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 all people own a computer, according to the @ORGANIZATION1 are most definatly a benifit to today's socity for the reasons that it allows better and easier world comunications, makes text and information, more redily avalible to the public and allows the advancements in technology that are nessesary. Communication is a vital part @ORGANIZATION1 america and the world in this day and age. Communication is souly run by the commputer. @CAPS3 computers provide better and faster communication. They are also far more reliable. In the @DATE2's if you wanted to speech with some one who is far away you would have to send a letter. Along with sending a letter is the risks that it will not get there. it will be stolen in the mail and @ORGANIZATION1 course the time that it would take to ge there. All @CAPS3 are solved in todays email and instant messiging (@CAPS2), @CAPS3 are relible, cant be stolen, and can go across the globe in seconds. Computers are not only a way for communication but also one @ORGANIZATION1 the most prominate ways to research, @CAPS4 the internet people would need to go to the library and run the risk @ORGANIZATION1 the book not being there or the library being closed. Through the internet all the information @ORGANIZATION1 the world is available @NUM1./ Computers are also the former in todays technological advances. Computers allow us to have inventions that run there self so human operation is not nessisary. this same technology saves lives every day and alows us to create @ORGANIZATION3 better technology. As you can see computers are the greatest technology created in the @DATE1 and allows faster and more relible communication, is the greatest library the world has ever known, and allows for the creation @ORGANIZATION1 even more advanced technologies. Computers are an extreme benifit to socity and nessisary in this @ORGANIZATION3 era.",10
7,"I think computers are bad because people use them all the time to go on facebook and other wedsites that are sometimes wast of time. People should not go on the computer as much and explore outside and go for walks, explore the woods, exersise most people do not get alot of exersise that they need because there an the computers. People showed stop making computers so less people go on them and so people can exersise more and loss weight. If people stop making computers some people would stop going on bad wedsites. People should only go on the computer for reasurch for projects or for homework liketyping papers. Parentent and kids need to exersise to stay healthy because people do not wnat diebedes when they are young so it really important to exersise so bad things do not happen to your body people need to stay healthy and exersise. All the computer deos is mess up your brain so you do not exersise. So get off the computer exersise, explore outside, go on walks, and explore the wood you never know what you will find in the woods. Go see what you can find. There will be some interesting things you will find like different kinds of bugs and of insects. You might even find a lady bug. There is all diffrent kinds of bees and you might find one that looks like something. So go outside and explore you will never know what you will find. Go for walkts you will never know what you will find and different kinds of houses and the colors of the house the diffrent kinds of front doors, diffrent kinds of houses like small, meddiem, and large. Some house will have diffrent color. The diffrent kinds of animals like dogs and cats that are in the window or outside. You should go hangout outside. You should go hangout outside with family, friends or both and look at the diffrent stuff in nature. Made you can talk pictures and make a scrap book out of the pictures. Make go in the woods and wake around. Just get out and exersise and you would think to yoruself I should get out and exersise more afften instead of being on the computer because I am having more fun hanging out with friends and family and I am doing exersise at the same time instead of being on the computer. In plus the computer was getting boring.",8
8,"I think we need our computers. If we dont have competer's we wont be able to connect to our family that could live in anther state or country. I no how there is texting now but some people dont even have phones or nothing how can you connect to them you cant call it might not be free with the phone palan you have. If a family member coms and visits you they would probuly email you about it but if there is no computers they can't tell when there coming. Are they gong do show unispectly they might not even be home and if they show up without them knowing there out of luck. And we exersize on our overtime we pick what time and we do it and if we play a sport were enjoying nature some people might have job's that take place outside of if. There are nerd's that are on computers all day long but in sure they enjoy nature I dont know about exersizing but they have a car and every thing they drive and things. Also, about the exersizing every on has to exersize to stay in shape im pretty sure people dont want to be fat there whole life they want to look good and feel good about there self. If it is a holiday or something and people want to send them something to wish then of whetever holiday it is. There not gonna be able to see them in person if they live so far away inless they plan to meet each other but even if they do that there gonna want to email then not call were it costs money and texting only comes with sertain plan's of phones so all there is left is emailing. Sometimes, people will more fron of you that your ollways on the computer if your not dont worry at least you get to email your family that you dont ever seen. These reasons are my opinion that dont get rid of computers and other things.",7
9,"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are many people who use computers this advanced technology we have. Lots of people life that we had computers they have lots of benefits that come with having computers. But not everyone agrees with this @CAPS2 are many people who don’t like that people use computers to much it takes away less time from enjoying nature, exerising, and interesting with family and friends. But I think on people with computer such as talking to people who you cant see, looking up information gives people something to do. One of the effects computers have on people is it allows you to talk to people you really dont see. I say this beacause not all your friends go to the same school so you dont see them as much. But they might have email, myspace, and facebook. Surf you cant online. It makes it easier to talk to them instad of driving so you can see them. I think that is @CAPS2 are activities you have to do or other activities, they need to do The second effect computers has on people it allows you to look up information. Think of it have you to do a project and you dont always have enough information on what it is to do it. But if your computer it gives lots of you can find information. I think that computer can help you in that way the endless sites of information and of better. Also the might be times go on a trip and know how much it cost and how long its going to take to set to you destination. Well if you look it upon the computer it will be all their for you to see also where else will you find this information you call to questions when consist go to the website. The third effect computers have on people are it gives you something to do. I say this because not all the time will you me to do something to do. Sometimes you will be bored something to do go on computer. The things you can do like play games. Also watch videos on youtube. For example you funny keeps you laughin add on the computer you watch videos. Another thing you can do is download music to your do you ever have line that think of not busy so do it now. See these @MONTH1 things you can go on the computer. To conclude I think that computers have lots of effects on people. These are about computer how people spend time on them. But I disagree is many good effects computers can have on people. I hope you agree with me. These are the three effects computers has on people allows you look up information, gives you something to do.",8
10,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 staff, Are computers helpful to us regularly? Computers are very helpful machines that increase productivity daily. Computers not only help people discover @ORGANIZATION1 places and learn more about other parts of the world, but also computer allow people to communicate with others around the world. In addition, computers have word processor and other applications that help workers do their jobs daily. So, now do computers help people learn more about our earth? Many teachers and students use computers daily to help them teach. There are many online websites that help students discover and process different areas around the world. For example, there is a @LOCATION1 website (www.canadamaps.org) and this website has a map and students have to match the place/area onto the map. There are also website such as mapquest & yellowpages to help people navigate cross country and around town. As you can see, computers also help students education and just our everyday life. A large amount of teenagers of all ages like to use a programs on computers called @CAPS1. @CAPS1 stands for @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This program allows people of all ages to talk with their friends or colleages instantly. What one does, is type in a chat box to someone and the message is instantly sent to the person. Emailing is used for many things. To catch up with friends, or to talk something with another. One can also attach documents that @MONTH1 consist. Emailing helps things go faster as well as your computers. But, if your newspaper were written out by hand, then that would take a lot of time, people, paper, & money. As you can even see, @ORGANIZATION1, computers are a necessity! So, as you can see computers really are needed. Computers affect us in many ways that aren't noticed clearly or easily. Like I said, computers teach and help people learn about different places among the world today, helps us communicate with others around us or in @LOCATION2! And as well, allow us to bring our work, family, friends, and cases everywhere we, in addition to computers allowing us to word process papers so our lives are ease for our everyday life. So, don't spent your life on the computer but use it for our needs. Please use computers to help our everyday routine. Stop writing on that pad, get up and type it on your computer!",9
11,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion for using ""too much"" computer time is an outrage. I think people should have more ideas. Such as as exercise, socialize with family and friends, and lastly, ""you time"" which means to do whatever you would like to do indoors BUT @CAPS2 computers. For excersice you can do any sport that you like outside. For @CAPS3 and spending time with family and friends you can have a nice family reunion at their house @CAPS5 just ""hangout with your friends. Four ""you time you can draw, @CAPS5 read a book. Their is a lot of ideas instead of ""computer time @CAPS6 the time!"" With exercising can go outside and play sport such as basketball, soccer @CAPS5 baseball, etc. You could even play hide and seek with your friends @CAPS5 even tag. Anything that keeps you moving out of the house ins tead of using computers! If you exercise everyday such as ""workout"" to get fit you will definatelly manage that instead of using ""computer time"". Exercising is a good idea ins tead of using ""computer time!"" @CAPS3 with family and friends is a good use instead of ""computer time because you can finally have the time to spend time with then like talk to them, play games @CAPS5 eat dinner together. That's called ""@CAPS3"" Your family @CAPS5 friends will love to spend time together by eating dinner together and have a nice conversation. You could also play any board games such as ""monopoly"" too. With your friends you ran go to the movies, have a sleepover @CAPS5 play outside. Many good little ideas to do with family and friends instead of using ""computer time."" The last idea for ins tead of using ""computer time"" lis doing ""you time indoors. WARNING! But @CAPS2 computer time! You could do something quite like draw a nice picture. That's something nice and quite to do instead of using ""computer time."" @CAPS5 you could even read a book too. Maybe you have to catch up on your nightly reading for language arts and you want start reading your goal book. If you choose to do ""you time, you will definately manage to undo that useless ""computer time!"" @CAPS6 of these ""ideas"" for not using the computer is very easy. It's not healthey to sit around the computer @CAPS6 day! Instead you can exercise. You could also socialize with family and friends. Lastly, do ""you time. but don't use a computer!!! If you want to achieve a goal you can mange that!!!",10
12,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, I am expressing my concern to you about the side effect new technologies, such as computers have an humans. Computers impact humans in a harmful manner because people are spending too much @ORGANIZATION1 their quality time on their computers which additionally leads to less time spent doing exercise. People also do not get to spend as much as their days outdoors and interacting with friends and family. Firstly, people are spending too much @ORGANIZATION1 their time surfing the net. Study show that an average @CAPS1 spends in total @NUM1 hours a day on the computer, almost double what they should be spending on it. Dr. @DR1 from the @CAPS1 technology society, says' that if this increases @ORGANIZATION1 time spent on the internet, continues for more years, most @CAPS3 will completly lose contact with family and friends outside @ORGANIZATION1 the social computer network. The average weight @ORGANIZATION1 a @NUM2 year old has increased from @NUM3 pounds in @DATE1, to @NUM4 pounds today. Statistics show that the main caus for this dramatic increase in weight is due to the acessive amount @ORGANIZATION1 time spent on computers in addition @CAPS4 do not have as much time to exercise. Teenagers need to exercise three times a week for thirty minutes each. @CAPS5 the average adolescent only spend ten minutes a week exercising not including gym. All @ORGANIZATION1 these numbers must change and a way to start would be losing the computer because people are spending too much time on them and less time exercising. Secondly, comuters are effecting the people get to go outside and enjoy nature. Form my personal experience nature is a beautiful thing to be apart @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS5 now adays I spend way too much time on social networks such as facebook, my space and @CAPS6 others. How often do you go outside to take a walk, fo for a bike ride or something else? A study done by @PERSON2 shows that the average person living in @LOCATION1 have only spent a total @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM5 days outside in the past two years after reciving their new computer. This must change people need to enjoy what this world has to offer. Thirdly, computers have effected the interaction between family and friends. ""@CAPS6 people hav only been interacting with family at mandatory times such as school meetings."" says @ORGANIZATION1. Family and friends are a major importance in everyones lives. I love to sit down and talk with my mom over a steaming cup @ORGANIZATION1 hot chocolate. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people now a days do not spend anytime with family and @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people use computers to interact with friends. It is vitally important that people stop using computers because ""before you know it you will have lost all communication with family and friends"" says @PERSON1 from I.U.M Computers help people lose communication and interaction with fmily and friends. In conclusion, I urge you to make the right desion by quitting using computers and in return will be a much happier and stronger individual. Computers impact humans in a terrible way because people spend too much time on them leading to a lack in exercise, time spent outside and in addition interaction between friends and family. Sorry about the lack @ORGANIZATION1 organization towards the end, I ran out @ORGANIZATION1 space. Please excuse the mess. Thank you.",10
13,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have some opinions on technology is going these days and about how many people shun the idea of further advancement for the understandable reasons that it brings people away from family and that it draws people's attention away from the rest of the world I do see their point but I'd like to make a point myself. While statistics show a @PERCENT1 decline in recreational activities people also find more things to do and now that the world is more concerneD for the environment you will probably see people coming outside again because they heard about some new environmental actavist group to join or they watch a movie that makes fun of live action role playing and decide to give it a whirl. My point being that you never know what your going to discover in the media and its better than sitting outside all day with no insperation, waiting for your parents to get home and give you information from outside you tiny world. The other item I will mention is the music industry and how it is revolutionized with more advanced, and different ways of listening to it in fact the only problem in music today are the artist and how they take advantage of recording studies and on occasion another just to gain fame! Without doing anything but sit back and lip sync. But the technology of the day give us the ability to listen to music the golden age of music now. So why not advance and invest in the music industry, it will provide entertainment and fun for years to come. Advanceing technology is the music industry actually is probably good for the economey as well I mean if we didn'@CAPS4 have new @CAPS3 to bell to people every year that would be a huge decline in stock market prices not that were not in a crash right now but it wouldn'@CAPS4 be any better. That goes for cell phones too and any other piece of hardware that gets frequently upgraded it's just good for buisness. You see I belive that the point of life is joy so whats better than settling down with mabey a date some candlelight and a romance or thriller on the @CAPS4.V most people will enjoy just sitting down and watching the telly it's easy to relate to. The television has evolved in many good ways it's a way to lay down and unwind learn about so many different things mabey watch a show on @LOCATION1 it makes you feel like being there without actually being there. I helps us get updated on current events shows things that we want to do and shows us how to do it. I for example have learned so much from.",9
14,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people find the clicking and clacking of computers a nuscense. What they don't realize is thay are helping the youths lives and making them easier and they could be doing the same for them. This is why computers have a very good effect on people. First off computers arn't a bad thing if they are just helping people get to know each other better. You always see ad's for dating websites and other things like that. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of couples meet online. Thats a lot and to think they would have never if it wern't for computers. Second of all computers provide a tremendous amount of entertainment. There are over @NUM1 on computer games online. @CAPS2 of them are free too. I bet almost every kids has played a game on the internet before. Think about it your child could be out getting in trouble or be nice and safe at home playing on the computer. You are probably thinking, computers sound so childish and infantile. Well computers arn't just fun and games. They provide a lot of information. They are very useful for teens in school for projects, but they benefit adults in many ways too. It provides information on vacations, hotels, ext. Also computers now have videos all over on how to do things like how to and other useful information. So as you can see computers arn't just a pain. They help bring people together, provide entertainment and have very useful information. Think about it. A computer might save your life one day. Computers help peoples every day lives and they could be helping yours.",8
15,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you think that children spend to much time on the computer. The issue that is going around is @CAPS2 computers have good effects on people or bad ones. I strongly believe that they have bad effects on people. I believe this because people spend more time on the computer than they @CAPS2 exerciseing. Another reason is that people argue it teaches hand eye coordination, well so does sports and just playing. My last reason is that people argue that it is some thing that helps you learn about people and far away places, but books @CAPS2 the same thing. I know alot of people feel that computer have good effects but the truth is they have bad ones. First, people spend more to on the computer than they @CAPS2 exerciseing. People rather stay inside and play games on the internet then go outside and play tag or any sport. On a talk it was said that, ""In @LOCATION1 people are alot over wieght"", and it was also said that the number of over wieght people in the world was the of @LOCATION2"". So I believe that people should get of the computer and exercise. Secondly, people think that it teaches hand eye coordination but so @CAPS2 sports. Instead of being on the computer learning hand eye. You could be out side learning hand eye coordination. Again instead of just sitting at the computer your outside running around haveing fun while you learn hand eye coordination. My last reason is, that people argue that people use it to learn about far away places and people, but they have books for that too. People rather look stuff up on the computer but as soon as they're finsh the start playing games or the computer. Also some of the information might not even be true. Because people hack sights all the time and change things but you can't hack a book. The only thing you can @CAPS2 to change it is to rip out pages and that only waste your money to a new book. So I believe that books are more reliable. Now is the time to make your disicion. @CAPS2 computers have good or bad effects. I believe that computers have bad effect on people. Other things could teach you remarkable hand eye coordination and other great sources to about other place then the computer. Most importantly people should spend more time exerciseing the they @CAPS2 on the computer. Now it time for you to go ahead and put this on the front page of your newspaper and let the whole world know. ",8
16,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to you @DATE1 because of the concern of people that have computers. You are concerned about people whom own computers aren't spending time either excircising, enjoying nature, or not interacting with their family. I agree with the fact that @CAPS5 people have computers they become lazy and don't spend time interacting in any activities. I was in @CAPS1 one day and made a survay, for how many people agree that not many people because of computers aren't interacting in any activities. @PERCENT1 of the people I asked said they agree but of corse the others didn't care much. Many people @MONTH1 think it's normal but I checked a web site that specializes is weight and how to get to your feet and loose weight eazily, that web site is @CAPS3.com. I read an article on the web page and on paragraph @NUM1 sec. @NUM2 it states that the obesity in the @LOCATION1 is caused by either computer and/or lazyness. Of corse some people might disagree but at the same those people who disagree are big time athleats who do both. I had a chate with @PERSON1, a pro @CAPS4 player he said,""@CAPS5 I was a kid we didn't have those things we were either doing home work or playing outside with our friends. ""Even big time athleats agree. Well in conclusion I agree with the fact that because of the fact that people have computers makes them lazy and do not interact with their family.",8
17,"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever thought about how computers effect human beings? The impacts? The results? The education? I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow people to talk with others online, have the ability to educate in certain areas, and teach hand-eye coordination. Who says the only way to contact or communicate with someone is through letters or the phone? The technology brought upon using computers allows people to talk online with others in a fast, easy, enjoyable way. Have a question that you have to ask a friend, but someone else is using the phone? Write a letter! Oh wait, letters can take up todays and your question is urgent! The computer is an easy alternative for communication. Say you're an amazing singer with a beautiful voice and you want to find an agent more than anything. Computers are so advanced in technology that they can find you an agent in no time. E-mail, websites, @CAPS1, and more, are all ways you can contact that agent. Computers are a great way to communicate. The mind is an extrordinary thing. It can be filled with knowledge, and still have the ability to learn and understand more. Reading books is a fantastic way to learn, but the internet has so much more to offer and you are not only reading from one great author, but tons of great authors. The computer allows you to learn about far away places and important people without making that trip to the library. Have you ever heard of online colleges? They are advertised on @CAPS2.V. all the time. Some people @MONTH1 think that learning from home, laying in bed with a laptop placed in front of them is a distractive way to learn. But what about being comfortable and not intiminated by anyone else around you? Computers can help you get your college degree in a comfortable environment. Hand-eye coordinatin is an excellet and wonderful thing to have. Along with videogames, computer games teach you exactly that. Parents @MONTH1 think we kids are wasting our time playing games on the computer, but we are actually challenging our minds and our hand-eye coordinatin ability. Computers are key when it comes to pysicological learing. Handeye coordinatin is taught to us through games and such that we play without us even knowing it. Hand-eye coordination allows us to catch a ball or play sports, and computers help us acheive that.",10
18,"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people in the world use coumputers, we all know what computers are used for like surching the internet, games, work and school. Some people think that computers are good to use to help teach hand eye coordination, learn about other places in the world and talk with other people online. I am in @NUM1 grade at mystic middle school. I think that computers are not as good as some people think. Have you ever heard of computer camps. This is where some kids go because they are addicted to the computer. At this camp the kids are pulled away from the computer and pritty much forced to join gropes that do activitys like fishing or working together to solve a mystery. This camp is pritty much known as reliable for kids that are addicted to the computer. Another reason that computers are bad is because of the internet. The internet is a very dangerous. Place because you can chat to people that you dont even know. You never know the people could be messed on in the head. And try to find @CAPS4 where you like and come. you so you always have to be carful who you talk to other wise you could get. Nothing eve really goes right with computers, there alway getting slower and slower every time you use it. About every two years a kid or parent could go throw a computer. Also your computer doesn't have the right @CAPS3 it could get a vins and cost a person a few hundred dollars to get it fixed. Any thing could happen at any time with your computer, @CAPS4 of no where it could just die and not work and @CAPS2 of your data will be gone forever. Now that I have explaines my part of computers people will think different. Would you want to end up like one of those people, that are in a camp because they are on the computer to much. Or you never know you could forever and never be found. I alread know @CAPS5 much it is for coomputers to get fixed, but you might have to find @CAPS4 the hard way. That is why I think that computers just cause more truble for peolple.",8
19,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, spending too much time online has negative effect on society. People aren't getting a full social experience when they talk on email, facebook and twitter. Being on such sites has taken up time that could be spent in other areas, such as family, friends and school. They aren't being able to enjoy the outdoors and being able to exercise. Though online activity can be helpful spending too much time can be harmful. Interacting online can be a great experience for those who have friends and family who live far away. But spending too much time online can damage you social activity levels. In person interaction is better than online, because you see how the person you're talking to is reacting to everything you say. Having a good, positive social environment is benificial to you and your friend. Spending too much time on the computer can also damage you social relationship with your family. For family who live far away, and online is the only way to socialize, online interaction is a great thing to have. But for you close family, you could be missing out on their lives and how they are doing. Your relationship with you family could be in jeoporady because you insist on using your computer. When you use the computer, you're probably eating some food too. And spending time online is taking away your time from exercising those calories off. The obesity level in @LOCATION1 is increasing, probable cause being over-usage of computers. being outside is another thing missing from our lives because of computers we aren't experiencing the beautiful nature life our @ORGANIZATION1 has to offer, online activity is hurting our health, and making us not enjoy our outdoor life. In conclusion, being online too often is abusing our social, health, and taking up too much of our lives. Using the internet is good for adults so they can pay taxes, work at home, and do many other beneficial things for them and their families. But for other, less useful sites are being used to interact. Why not just call or meet up with person, instead of using the computers?",8
20,"Dear local newspaper, I support the advances in technology, and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I think this for @NUM1 simple reasons, @CAPS1, you gain computer skills, which can help in other situations. Second: Computers give people the chance to learn about faraway people and places.Lastly when you have a computer you can chat and talk to other people. When I think of a computer, I think of typing or a keyboard. After a few times of using a computer you get @CAPS2 and better it. You gain, typing skills, hand eye coordination and mouse skills. After jusst a few uses, your computer skills build up and you soon get good at it. When you do get @CAPS2 though, you get better quicker and more so it all works out very well. When you are on the computer, the internet allows you to search anything and everything. Weather it be a different culture or even schoolwork, a computer is helpful. When I am doing my homework, and I don't know how to another a question, I go on the internet. The computer allows me to get help with any homework I need help in, its great.I can even look up something on a different culture and compare it to ours. The computer allows me to do everything I need. Have you ever felt alone, but theres no one to talk to? Well that problem can be solved very simply, get on a computer. You can chat with people even if there is no one around. You can chat with someone half way around the world. Its amazing you can be anywhere, talking to anyone you want. A computers chat you to reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. Computers are great. When your on a computer, there is so much to do, so much you can get out of it. They are helpful and fun you never run out of options with a computer at your side. In my opinion, there is so much to gain and learn from a computer.",8
21,"Dear @CAPS1, I'm writing to you today about computers I believe that computers can teach you things such as, hand-eye coordination and how that, can open job doors for you. Also you can socialize as well as study with this device. My first reason being socialization. i think that this is a good way to socialize due to the many options. one example would be facebook. This is a social website that is used to connect or reconnect with friends. in a recent poll @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that computers had made them more social. Lastly, computers are a good way to socialize because of the range it can travel. You can talk to people without the long distance fees of . This can range from the @CAPS2.S to hungary in seconds. My second reason would be that computers are useful in studies. I would say this because even though books are good they use hard to find. With the computer you can access multiple sites. This being you can from wikipedia all the way to the infamous google in just . Another reason I believe computers are good for studies in that you have endless. you will get a the . The lost . My third and final reason is computer give you exceptional hand-eye coordination can because I know accountant. i asked him, ""@CAPS3 did you take that accounting job?"", and he answered, ""They only took me because I have good hand-eye coordination."" @CAPS4 thats one job exemple, another would be real state. Due to computers multiple options you can look up because in the your client. With good hand-eye, however, you can be more efficiecnt with your work. This could help you lead competition, thus, making you more money. This then ends my essay. Stating with socialization, skipping down to studies and ending right on jobs and and bye's front steps. These are only @NUM3 of the many bountiful things that a computer can do. @CAPS1 I hope you read this with my regards.",9
22,"Dear local newspaper editor, @CAPS1 you love haveing the enternet at your finger tips. Recently, it has been bought to my attention that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers. I firmly believe that this is correct. My three arguments are its not healthy, the friends you meet up there are siber friends and bad @CAPS5 @MONTH1 occur. First of all, being on the computer too much is not healthy. This reminds me of my friend named @CAPS2. @CAPS2 used to be humerous, outgoing and play alot of sports. One @CAPS3 day, her mother bought her a laptop. This laptop was blue and white-her two faverite colors. She was on it all day and all night. She took it with her everywhere she went. Well, it got to the point whare she stopped the sports, gained some weight and the sadness creptped upon her. She was in a depresion mode. She went to the doctors and they told her that she had to give up the computer and play with it for only two days a week for five hours only. She listened to the doctor and it took her about three months to get back to the fun @CAPS2 she used to be. Being on the computer too much can harm you and the people around you. Second of all, the friends you meet on the enternet are called cyber friends. You don't know who they realy are, where they realy live, or their real age. They can tell you any thing they want because they know that that's a little fantasy world. That is mently not healthy. It is very important for human beings to be socialy active. Being on the computer too much can harm your brain also. Third of all, @CAPS5 @MONTH1 pop up. If you are the type of person who is on the computer every chance you get like becky, it is not good for you or the device. Being on the computer can harm even the computer. Well, you've read my arguments and ideas. Please take them into consideration.",8
23,"Dear @CAPS1 times, @CAPS2 you think computers benefit society? Well I think so! There are countless reasons why computers are both resourceful and helpful. Many citizens in our own community of watertown think computers are a great resource for many things while others disagree with this completely. Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet, also you can interact with your friends and family, and lastly there are many applications used for business. On both a computer and the internet there are more than @NUM1 million things you can learn. When you are struggling with homework a computer is a great resource. You can quickly open @CAPS3.com and search any topic at any time. For example, if you did not know a conversion it is easily found on the internet. Another thing you can be taught or informed about is news. There are websites such as nytimes.com and cnn.com that give you daily news. I personally use these websites weekly. On the computer you can find vacation sports you want to learn about and go to. When my family was planning our trip to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 we used the computer constantly. In the end, computers can teach you many things. Secondly you can interact with people on the internet in many ways. These include social networking websites, webchat and email. Social networking websites are a great way to connect to family members and friends from the past. Websites that were created for this include: facebook, myspace, and twitter. These free websites let you add friends, send messages, and post pictures. Web chatting is a way to video people. You can personally see someone from acroos the @ORGANIZATION1 from your webcam. Lastly, emailing is a great way to inform people. You can write a visual letter to one of your friends. In conclusion, the computer is one excellent way to interact. Lastly, the computer is used for business. An application called microsoft office is used in countless bussinesses, microsoft office word, powerpoint, excel and @CAPS4. Each of these are used to plan, sell, present, manage, and write about products. Microsoft is something you should download in the near future. Business also use webchatting, as I previously state, for conference calls. A production company can be face to face with a company from china without being in the room with them. This makes it much easier than to fly half way across the @ORGANIZATION1. Finally, computers are used when manufacturing a product in or at a business. Work sites such as @CAPS5 companies use computers to control their machines. I know that the @ORGANIZATION2 factory uses computers in their factory due to the fact that I watche the show unwrapped about them on @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In the end computers are a necessary item in a business. In conslusion, computers have a great affect on people. The can teach people many new and exciting things they did not know. Also, connect humans with each from half way across the @ORGANIZATION1. Lastly, businesses would not run well without a computer. Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet. Also you can interact with your friends and family, and there are many applications used for business. If I were an expert I would have nothing to worry about concerning computers. They are a magnificent thing. @CAPS2 you have the same belief and understanding as me?",10
24,"Today in our society almost everyone uses computers weather @CAPS4 to do research, play games, or interact with others. These are all positive things. The schools across america are using computers from @NUM1 grade to online colledges. People benefit from computers by getting everything and anything done from them. @CAPS2 anyone who has a brain can relize that computers are a positive in todays society. First off computers are a positive thing because they can get almost anything done for you. you can play on them, and interact with others the reason that the computer being able to get almost anything done for you @CAPS4 a good thing because if you need to get work done you can do that if you need research @CAPS1 can do that and @CAPS1 can help you In any subject. The reasons that playing games can be positive @CAPS4 @CAPS1 does not only give you great hand eye cordonation but @CAPS1 also exersises you brain and can be a learning for young children. The reasons that interacting through the computer @CAPS4 that you learn how to be and talk through email for buisnesses and,make many @CAPS2 pleases use your brain and that computer our society today. @CAPS2 to keep on going americans are the smartest people in this world and our very well.

Its for your own good.",9
25,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 would a person do with out a computer? Well I think nothing because @CAPS1 if you are like me that have their family far away in another country well whith a computer you can see them throught a camara and talk to them just like if you where there. Computers just don't take your time they help you understand the menning of a family.These are many reasons why I think computers should be very important. My first reason is that they give you information about a place that you might be interested to see or know their culture. There are many people that like to explore and see new places, but they can't because maybe they just don't have time or they might have to much work. There is no exception for someone to not put their oportunities out, just because they don't have the time or a computer. My second reason is work. People like you that work in a office need information about a place that a disaster happened. You might need somenthing to see how it happen and @CAPS1 was the condition it happend. People that work in a important place need a computer because they are saving their work so they don't lose it and get fired. My third and last reason is to be organized. Being organized is very important it helps you keep a job or having everything on hand. Well computers are not just a pass of time it also makes your life easier. Many people say that they don't @CAPS1 to have to much papers; with a computer you can have all those paper in just one page that is saved by you, and only you can see it. As you @MONTH1 see many people that have computers use it in a productive way. It's not just a pass of time like people say it is. It also helps you do many stuff for your own future: not just to play around with some new friends. Well as you @MONTH1 see this are my three main reasons for keeping a computer in your house and using it in a good and productive way. ",8
26,"Technology is advancing every day. One main technilogical device that is popular is the computer. More and more people are using them, however, not everyone agrees that it benifits society. I believe that it does benifit us. One reason is that you can explore things at home. Before computers you would have to go to the library, find the book you need, and then search through it until you found the information you needed. Those things alone could take hours, especially if you don't live near on library. However, with computers you could just type it in on a search engine and find what your looking for. That could save you gas money because you don't have to drive anywhere. Another reason is that you can communicate online for free. Without a computer you would either have to go see that person by driving, talking on the phone, or texting, wich are all expensive. On the computer you have e-mail, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and many more. All of them you can communicate in different ways. If you want to look at pictures, take quizes, play games, or talk, thats @CAPS2. And finally for e-mail, you can send people letters videos, or you can just talk to other people by typing like all the others.",8
27,"What if you're family all and to talk to them percent of people commucate online, and thats not a bad thing. Heres the thing, are you for or against kids/parents online for too long. I am all for this. Reasons being are lots of kids have friends that they talk to online, secondly kids have homework/projects that they might have to look up online, and my last reason for this is, some family might have @CAPS1 ect, so they can communicate online. My first reason for this is, a lot of kids have friends online that can't text or even talk on the phone, so this is another easier way to talk to them. Did you know that most kids communicate online now. ""I think the internet is a great things, I mean I would rather have my kids online than outside roaring the and getting into troupe."" @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1. @NUM1 of @NUM2 kids are online communicating with others. Without a doubt, kids bring home projects and homework everyday right? Wouldn't you rather your kid looking up information online, then have them guessing and getting it wrong? I know that alot of children don't have computers, internet or essy, or maybe their got allowed online. That's why they. I remember the times when I had a project due at school, and I guessed on. that didn't do my grade any good. So then I decided the next time I have a project to do it on the internet. And it worked, I got a much better grade then I did on the one I guessed on. Lastly, mostly everybody has on the internet and would live to and with them while. So even stay online too often your not on it for a bad reason, your on to talk to your family."" @CAPS3 I got internet in my house, I barly ever got to talk to my family. But just then, my son me to get one, and I have the chance to talk to my family everyday. @CAPS2 a recent of a computer. Some people do say on the computer for too long at times, and don't get out on exercise the amount a humane should. or they don't get out of the house as much as they used to @CAPS3 they got the internet. Yes but, it's a good cause, it's not like because forever. Also it's being used for good. Not for anything bad. I think the internet is a great thing, and it puts a effect on many people. Reasons are, kids have friends online to talk too, ""lots of that needs internet, and last of people have family online to talk to so it's now or get out there and your best pick. The issue grapple with is if you for or against internet acess! So get out there, and change now.",8
28,"Dear Local Newspaper, I have herad that you guys are deciding whether or not computers have a negative or positive impact on the society. In my opinion, I believe computers have a very negative impact not only to adults but mostly to students too. Computers in general can be distracting, very dangerous, and give people less time to excercise. Computers in total do not have a bad impact on people. Some people say computers are not distracting, well I say they are. Computers have varies websites such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 which can distract people from studying or even doing their homework. @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 are websites where you can chat with friends and see peoples pictures. These websites can be very interupptive when trying to do something important. For example, I am one of the biggest slackers when it comes to doing homework or studying. If I had to choose between doing homework or chatting on @CAPS1, I would choose @CAPS1. But if you actually think about, are these websites benefitting anybody. Homework and studying can actually benefit you in doing better can benefit you in your studies and ferther on in your life. In total, I believe computers are a big distarction. When people go on the computer they go on without worrying a little bit. They don't know the danger behind it. These dangerous computer have people on it called online predators. Online predators sit on the computers basically all day trying to harm others. One website in specific that I herad was very harmful is myspace. This website is even more dangerous then @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. Myspace is like @CAPS1 in a way but very dangerous. For instance, my mom told me that one of her friends daughter had a myspace and became friends with a guy she didn't know. Of course she didn't worry because according to her he seemed a nice guy so she gave him her number. Good thing her mom saw it, otherwise something bad would happend. He ended up being an online predator. Lastly, computer can make people unhealthy. People who stare on computers non-stop can make them not exercise. For example, not playing sports such as soccer, vollyball, and tennis. This is very unhealthy for people in our society because they can become obese and unhealthy. This is why computers can make you not exercise. In conclusion, computers can have a very negative effect on people. It can be very distracting, dangerous, and unhealthy for not exercising. In total, computers cannot have a bad impact on people.",9
29,"Dear The @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has been an argument wheter computers do or do not have a positive effect on people. Some believe, that computers have negative effets on people for example spending too much time, not exercising, and not interacting with family and friends. However, I believe computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, lets people know about faraway places, and allows people to talk online. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on people. Did you know hand-eye coordination can be helpful at times? Well, it true because if you are in distress and the phone is broken and you don't have a cellphone then send an emergency e-mail to one of your friends informing them to call all and since you have hand-eye coordination you can type without having to look down. Also if your in college and have an important essay due tomorrow then hand-eye coordination can really help you write down notes without having to look back at the writing paper. Finally, with hand-eye coordination it can help you can join the army because if you spot a threat you can aim and shoot quickly without having to take out the gun after threat attacks. To conclude, computers teaches hand-eye coordination. Have you ever wanted to go to a forgein places? Well with computers you can do that you can just search the place and see what the place has. Fethermore, if you want to learn to speak a forgein language you can all you have to do is type in the language with a question and search its so easy a baby can do it. Finally, if you want to learn how to cook like forgein places do then type in the type of food or its name and search. To summarize, computers lets people know about forgein places. Have you ever have the feeling that you want to talk to somebody? I know I have this is why computers can help you talk to people online just tree the person's e-mail adresses and type the message. Also you don't have to waste money on paper and envelopes. Finally, having an e-mail is free so you can talk all you want. To conclude, computers help people talk online. In summarization, computers have a positive effect on people. It helps them have hand-eye coordination, learn about new places, and lets them talk.",10
30,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 there is alot of talking and arguing about computers. Some say they are helpful to society and others say not. As for myself I am one of those on the side of which is for computers. I think the do alot less harm than good. First of all the hand-eye cordination of the user is mostly improved over a period of time, which helps withe learning musical instruments. Also it gives a great learning ability to people, particularly student. If there were computers, for a student to do a report he/she would have to read through an encyclopedia, which takes a great amount more time than plainly looking it up on the internet. Finaly computers are great for communicating with far-away friends or family. The first subject on my agenda is the hand-eye cordination skills. These skills are the ability to work with your hand and eyes simultaniously. There is a number of impacts these skills can make. The most apparent is musical instruments. If you are trying to learn a new song to be played on guitar you must move your fingers to the notes coresponding with the screen. Another place where hand-eye cordination comes in handy is sports. One sport where hand eye cordination makes a huge impact is in football. If the ball is thrown then the wide recever must watch the ball with his eyes and make sure he puts his hands in the best position to catch the ball. I am also going to argue the vost world of learning that is provided by computers. Lets just say someone asks you who was the @NUM1 president of the @ORGANIZATION2 where would you go to find that answer? I don't know about you but I am definatley going to look it up on google (internet search engine). Also schools @CAPS1 can ask alot more of their students because they have all this information at there desposal. Lastly I would like to cover the communications abilitys that the computer puts out there. First of all let say you have a very close friend move out-of-state"" how are you going to keep in touch. You could try using phones but yet the long-distance fees have sky-rocketed over the past @NUM2 years. Did you know that if you talk long distance for @NUM3 mins a day that would be over @NUM4 a month. in todays ecconmy you need to save money not talk it all away. The internet charges no additional fees for chatting no matter how far away you are from each-other. So hopefully my letter will be able to surposs ""@CAPS2'bama's failed health care bill"" to at least make it somewhere in the paper. People need to know the facts about computers before they try to argue about them.""",9
31,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion on computers is that they have a positive affect on people. I think this because I know some people that excersise and go on the computer mainly, I don't think computers are a bad thing. Some people learn on computers. They learn how to exercise. Sure some people just chat and learn about that far away place they could go there and explore the buety and nature. I think computers are great effects on people, They help out a lot. I know @CAPS2 uncle that came from @LOCATION1 he learned how to speak english of the computer. He learned a lot and we were all proud. Some effects that computers have on people are a lot. People have classes online they go to @CAPS3 mothers that are single that have kids for example, they get their diplomas and degrees of the computer online. And theirs other @CAPS3 @CAPS2 aunts and uncles they go to english classes online and work. A lot of people have classes online. @CAPS3 i go on @PERSON1 all the time all the time. @CAPS4 teaches me how to type. @CAPS4's fun, but also educated. I think that all computer have positive effects on people. All of them should their should'nt be one computer with negative effects on people. But that's only by @CAPS2 opinion. Computers are @CAPS3 robots they do lots for us. We type reports, learn, read online. And then theres also were we play games online, and educated games. I believe that their are lots of resources. You could search up a lot of stuff. For example you could search up: mistery, animals, natures and places. You wouldn't beleive how many results the computer has. So who would have negative effects of the computer. All @CAPS4's trying to do is help us and out education @CAPS4 helps me with @CAPS2 spanish sometimes. So why would people think that computers arn't good ideas? Computers are great for everything. I could go on and see what the weather is for tommorrow. Also I could see what the news are, and i could contact @CAPS2 teachers through the computer. I think a computer would always have a positive affect on people.",9

33,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, a majority of the @ORGANIZATION1 population will use any type of computer at least once a day. Our society has been around computers so often that some peole will find it hard to even live without them. Computers have become something that people depend on. This, however, is something to take as a concern. when people are dependent on computers too much, they loose valuble skills that the once possesed and they spend less time, outside exercising while also loossing touch with famly and friends. It has become near that computers have become along part of peoples lives. Computers posses the ability to do certain human tasks that seem hard for us to do. Before the computer age, it was a lot more difficult to find information on a topic or place. We used to have to use encyclopedias or find books on those topics. Sometimes we would even have to travel to a place and learn about it. Today, however, people use technology to find this information. You @MONTH1 be thinking, "" @CAPS3, how is this a bad thing?"". The reason it is a problem is because people have begun to loose the ability to use books like encylopedias and atleses or even simmple maps. Once, most of the population could use these tools to help find their way through information or a place. I know from experienc, that I can barley look at a map and find where I am. We have become too dependent on @CAPS4's and computers, which in turn makes us forget valuble information. What would happen if someone got lost and they didn't have a working @CAPS4 or signal on their phones. They would get lost and not know how to read a map. As you can see the human population has because too dependent on computers. Additionally, people all around the world have become addicted to the internet. Facebook, @CAPS6 and even @CAPS7 baseball have become an addicting activity that people consume all of their time with. When people begin to spend hte majority of their time on these websites, they will in turn get less excersise, and become more distant from family and friends. Mostly teenagers have this problem. If you took a survay of the number of students who have a facebook account or @CAPS6, you would probably get the majority. Having an account like this is said to be addicting. Students, parents and everyone in between will find troubles later on because of this. America is one of the leading nations with obesity. Has anyone stopped to think that maybe people spend too much time on these websites to get any excersise? If the internet wasn't such a big thing it is now, I bet you there would be less overweight people. but not only do people become overweight, they will end up more and more distant from family and friends. My own sister spends so much time on her laptop that my parents had to take it away. Once, the only way for us to really talk to her through facebook. As you can see, computers can be a dangerous thing. think of all the people who you know that spend multiple hours on the computer. You can probably thnks of quiet a few. Computers are an addicting thing that can cause less excersising and less communication which is proven to support a healthy life style. Also when people use computers too much, they loose valueble skills. Remember this next time you are someone you know sits down at a computer for a long time. You can help them.",11

Because it help us find pleopl and it help us talk to peopl and it help you srech thing too I can have a brother that I never knew before then you can find that brother.

35,"Dear local newspaper, Those who do support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I, for one agree with them. Computers are wonderful devices that allow people of all ages to learn about the world and it's people. It allows people to talk to family members that live far away, freinds, or sometimes buisness associates. Technology.. also provides education. Don't you think socializing, and learning are two very important aspects of everyday people? Learning new things can only be interesting if you can actually see them. Books can be helpful defending on when it was made. Internet websites can gives you pictures uploads almost every week. Therefore you know where you want to book your next visit. Yes books can give you tons of information, but not as much as the thousands of websites there are out there right this minute. Want to learn how to speak spanish look it up, fast and easy on the internet. No need to look and look a hundreds of books just to get one little fact. Throughout everything you do in a day chatting with friends is a good way to relax and have fun. Whether it's a close friend or a co-worker. There are now several ways to talk to friends, phones, texting, instant messaging, and even video chat! Yes it @MONTH1 cause time away from family, but you can easily say goodbye to the friend and talk to them later. Finally learning is a huge deal with people today. Well with this, advanced technology we have found ways to educate students in a fun way. Websites that are colorful and fun can teach kids how to multiply and read. About @PERCENT1 of children are more attached to colorful objects than books with words in them. So to all parents and guardians computers arent all that bad, they're actually very good. ",9
36,"I believe that computers have a negitive effect on people. Using the computer effects a person's time because the sit for hours playing online games, @CAPS1 also effects there heath because there not getting any fresh air or spending time with there family, lastly @CAPS1 effects there education because time they could be using doing there homework there on there computer. First useing the computer effects a person's time, @CAPS1 does that by wasteing hours sitting there when you could be outside playing or doing chores around your house. You could be helping your family or friends out but instead playing computer games. There goes all the time you could have been doing something good, wasted because of the computer. The computer also effects you heath because your in a room inside not getting any air. You're also not exerciceing and helping your body out. This could effect your emotional heath. When your on the computer your not talking to people and becoming social and you could loose connections with you friend and your family. When you loose your connections and become you will use your computer more and then @CAPS1 will become worse. My last reason is that @CAPS1 effects education because when you could be doing your homework and studing for an important lest on your on the computer learning nothing, then you will school and possably mess for ever! This is really bad because you were on the computer. A couple times I pushed homework aside to use the computer and my grades drops alot. So this is why @CAPS1 effects education. These are the reasons how the computer effects education, your heath, and your time. I know your thinking that computers could be used for education, but humans prefer fun over anything else and I hoped this helped you realized that.",8
37,"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I belive that computers offer a lot more pros than they do cons. Computers offer another way to learn things about the world. Computers @MONTH1 also act as a research, tool. If a child, or anyone @CAPS3 on the computer and a family member thinks it @CAPS3 an unreasonable amount of time, that sounds like it @CAPS3 just an issue between the person and his or her family. Many people @MONTH1 argue and say, ""look in the encyclipedea to learn about the world, ""but a computer @CAPS3 faster, easier more time efficient to use. In fact, most people in the newest generation of families probably don't have an encylipea set. For example, if I were to want to learn more about @LOCATION1, @CAPS4 of searching in a dictionary or encyclipea, I could go on the computer, type in @LOCATION1 and a whole slew of liks and opportunities are found. Some people @MONTH1 like the old ways, but personally. I like the freedom and easiness of a computer. Have you ever had to research for a project or report? Many people either in school or in the work field will most likely need to research something to get a better understanding. Yes, a dictionary @CAPS3 helpful. Yes a thesauris @CAPS3 helpful but there are separate things. Compared to a computer those classic research tools are still usefull, but could be a hassle. My point @CAPS3 a computer has a dictionary thesauris, encyclipedea...ect all in @NUM1! So next time you have to research something try reaching for the keyboard @CAPS4 of the bookshelf! To me, the problem of someone being on the computer too much sounds more like a Family problem than a social problem. Technology has changed our world! Ever since computers were invented not only have they downsized, but became more and more useful. The computer has opened more doors for our scociety, without computers, space travel for example would not be the normality it seems to be in this generation. All im trying to say @CAPS3, I don't think computers hurt our society, but are pretty much the building blocks for our world. While reading this paper I hope you noticed the pros of having computers in this world. A computer @CAPS3 a help learning tool, the king of all reaserch tools and a big part of our society today.If you could learn one thing from reading this paper, I would want you to think, ""@CAPS5 would we, as a world be without computers?""",10
38,"Dear people from the newspaper, I am concerned that people take too much time on the computer because it could cause trouble, voilence, & illegal crimes.

Lastly, I am concerned that people spend too much time on the computer because it could lead to illegal crimes, In @DATE3 a girl was talking to a boy online then when they decided to meet, he shot & killed her. It turned out he was just a person who lied about who he was online, @CAPS4 on a website online, a group @DATE1 men were talking about now much they hated kids so they decided to shot them @ their bus stops.

39,"Dear local newspaper: I strongly feel that computer technology has a neagtive affect on the people of our society. People of our society are spending to much time on computers, and not enough time exersizing and interacting with family and friends. By starting now we can make a difference in the lives of thousands. First off I would like to say that it is imporitive that we exersize daily. If we don't fit exersizing into our day to day schedual, we are potentally putting our health on the line. Activities such as taking a dog for a walk, riding a bike, or taking a nice jog through the park are just a few ways to help your physical fitness. Also taking part in extracuricular activities can play a major part in exersize. This not only helps physically, but it helps mentally too. Finnally another method of exersizing is to play a part in your local community service projects. Exersizing every day is just one way to keep you active and off the computer. Lastly, interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. Playing games is one way that can help you stay connected with your family. This can bring you closer to the people you love, and help them get to know you a little better. Furthermore you can play with your friends, and in the process develops social skills. Who knows developing social skills could help you in the future. Plus, by interacting with family and friends you can learn to be relaxed and let your life take its natural source. This is another helpful technique that can improve the quality of your life and keep you from the temptation of being on the computer. In conclusion techniques like exersizing and interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. By working together and trying these methods, the computer can be eliminated from our daily rutines.",9
40,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers! Computers have a great effect on people. The advances in technology with computers benefits the society. Computers give people a place to chat with others, learn on school websites, and it teaches people hand-eye coordination. Computers are changing the world throughout everywhere. Computers give people a place to interact with others. There are thousands of websites that have chat places and are online chat rooms. That gives you a place to talk to others and even see what might be going on throughout the world. Also, chat rooms on the computer can help friends always keep in touch. Studies show that ninety percent of @CAPS1 that have a chat room to go to with friends often have more friends than none. Obviously, the interactions with others on the computer have a great effect on people. School websites also give people benefits in our society. It gives us the ability to learn more about what we are learning in school and maybe the ability to learn new things too. When almost every school in the @LOCATION1 has a school website, that helps students who are having trouble in school I know that from my experiences that having a computer helps me in school whenever I forgot what my homework was or I need to study in a quiz or test, I can always go on my computer and find what I need for school. When the computer know that it benefits our society. Computers teach hand-eye coordination too. When you use the computer for games or anything you do it teaches you how to move the mouse quickly and keep your eyes to used on the screen. Whenever I have the ability to use the computer, I always do. That's because with all the and websites it will teach us hand-eye coordination with I'm just having fun. Ninety-five percent of people who use the computer enjoy to use it. That's ninety-five percent of people who are learning more hand-eye coordination. If that doesn't benefit the society, than nothing does. As I have shown, computers deffinitly do benefit society. I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. That is because it gives people a place to interact with others, to learn things on school websites, and they teach hand-eye coordination. In conclusion, computers have a strong effect on people today.",9
41,"Dear, @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 has come to my concern that many people are debating on whether computers benefit our society or not. Some people think computers are the lives of many people, but I have to disagree with those who say that. I think that computers benefits our society in there ways, they bring people together, they offer many websites to research a topic, and they let people shop at home. One way that computers help us is that they bring people together by using the internet. Many families do not live close to other relatives, making hard to see them. But with the internet, people can use social networking sites such as facebook or myspace to keep in touch with one another. Distant relatives can talk and share picture with one another to keep in touch. Also, the internet can help bring couple together and potentially lead to marriages. How @MONTH1 times have you seen those @CAPS3 harmony commercial that claim to have brought two singles together to make a happy couple? Another way that computers help today's society is that they offer many places to conduct research on a certain topic. There are so many search engines on the internet that lead you to numerous websites to help you find out what you need to know. Also, researching a topic on the computer is so much easier compared to going to the library and reading books. When using books, to research a topic, you need to find the right book, read the whole thing or at least most of @CAPS2, and find what you're looking for. But with the internet, you just type in what you're looking for, click, and go. Lastly, computers let you shop online and lead to a better shopping experience. By shopping online, you skip the long lines at retail stores which means less time walking to get your product. For example, many people rush to stores early in the @TIME1 for huge sales on ""@CAPS4 @DATE1."" A person could be left waiting in line for hours to get a product. Why wait outside for so long when you could just buy the product in the comfort of your own home and get the product delivered right to your house? Also, many websites offer special deals for shopping online so you can even money. In conclusion, I think that computers benefit our society in three ways, they bring people together, they offer many websites to research a topic, and they let people shop at home. A world without computers would be so much different than the world we live in today.",9
42,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A recent survey said that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors think the advances we have made with technology and computers is helping us rather than hurting us. I agree that computers are having a positive impact on us. Advances in technology are helping us become more efficiant. Computers also give us the ability to research places and things we @MONTH1 never get the opportunity to see in person. We are also able to talk online with other people who we might have not met otherwise. The most important, though, is our advances in technology. Recently on the news I saw a segment of how at @ORGANIZATION2 they are using robots to make surgery more efficient. This also means that there are smaller incisions being made, so that means a faster recovery. Another part of society that has been advancing is crime solving. Before there were computers, there was no blood testing, no fingerprinting, and most likely no x-rays. Computers made these things much easier for people to accomplish. Computers are also useful for lending us the ability to research far away places or other topics that they @MONTH1 just have. Some people @MONTH1 never have the opportunity to go to places like @LOCATION4 or @LOCATION3, but with the computers it's almost like they have been there. Or maybe is in @CAPS1, but @CAPS1 isn't a very popular sport in @LOCATION2. And then they go on there computer and see that there is a ragby @LOCATION1. Then their problem is solved. When you go to a new country, you also get the opportunity to meet new people. But with computers and online sights like @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or you can talk to virtually anyone in the world. I could be sitting in a chair at my home in @LOCATION2, and be having a conversation with someone across the country, or maybe even across the ocean! Or possibly you could be talking to some of your really close friends who live just across town. Either way, the computer is a convinient place to go and talk to someone. I believe that computers are doing us more good than their harm. Our advances in technology have helped us emensly with things like games and robotic surgery. They also give us the ability to search topics we want to know more about or a faraway place we've never been to. Finally, we are able to talk online with people that @MONTH1 just be across town or across the ocean. I hope that my reasoning helps you understand my point of view.",10
43,"Dear @PERSON1, The advansing technology is showing a very negative affect on people. Because of computers people are spending too much time on computer and less time doing things that are better for them. First, spending too much time on the computer can be bad for your health in many ways. For example, looking at a bright computer screan for more than @NUM1 min at a time is extremely bad for your eyes. The brightness damages your eyes and can lead to severe loss of vision. Also, if you spend all of your time indoors and on the computer you will not get the exersize you need. @PERSON1, were you aware that for every @NUM2 min you are on the computer you should spend @NUM2 min outside. It is very important to get fresh air, sunlight, and exersize. Moreover, another problemwith computers is that you don't get as much interaction with people. With online chatting you can't know what the other person is feeling like, @PERSON1, or if you are even talking to other person you think you're talking to. It is much better to interact with people in person, face to face. To have good social health you need to hang out with friends, and laugh, and have a good time, not sit in a dark room and talk with online friends. @PERSON1, people need to interact with real people. Furthermore, computers can be very distracting to many people. For example, @PERSON1, say you needed to type up an article for the paper on the computer, but you decide to play a game for a min, or look something up, or talk with a friend. You say that it will only take a minute and then you with type the article. But when you stop all of a sudden you played for @NUM4 hours. Then you have to stay up later to finish. Computers are extremely distracting. People of all ages have this problem of being distracted by computers and not gettind work done. In conclusion, computers, although an advance in technology, have very negative side affects. @PERSON1, I feel that it is our job to tell the people of the negitive side effects of computers. It is our job to help people over come the side affects of computers. Please @PERSON1, we need to help the people by writing an article in the paper to warn them of the terrible effects computers have.",8
44,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand the conterversies between having computers. Computers are the center of technology. I can't imagine a world without them. Though having a computer @MONTH1 cause children to play uneducational games, computers teach more and help children as well. I know for your company, having no computer would be a nightmare. It gives education to not only children, but adults as well. First of all, computers are proven to be the second best source of education, behind school, along with the best source of information. Millions of websites are specified to only education of all kinds. Not only are there websites. these are @CAPS1's with online tutors or just work. Computers provide practically anthing you need. For work, adult use. computers to sell something communicate with someone or just look up a new topic. The technology of a computer is farther than any other item. Without a computer life would be much more difficult. Instend of just sending an email, mail would have to be sent out. Most information would have to from brooks. In fact even the internet has books to buy and read. I am aware that people feel that children are spending too much time on the computer talking to friends, but children need to be social, @CAPS2 it weren't talking on the computer, there would just be more texting and calling. The computer makes life so much easier that to take it away would cause stress and less time for other important activities. Lastly. computers have documents and it is the best way to type. Your company can definetly agree that without typing documents life would be a mess. Everyone writes up documents and needs to send them, open them up again, and edit them. The only other access to typing is a type writer. Types writers can't save anything, delete and do half the work computers do. Your whole job depends on the computer and typing. How would you feel @CAPS2 you couldn't use a computer. In conclusion, computers are a necessity to our living. Without computers life would be difficult and stressful. Computers give education stand information to everyone. The technology is unbelievable and makes everyday life, easier. I couldn't even imagire no documents and typing. I'm sure you will agree with my decision. I hope you chose to inform others with this information. Thank you for your time",10

I stay healthy and fit I dont sit on the computer all day on a sunny day. You become more if you go more it gives you a chance to hang out with some neighborhood kids. When I get home every day I do my homework then I go outside and play, then later I go on the computer for @NUM1 minutes then @CAPS1 done and I go to bed and the same thing the next day.

I don’t think you are going to go out an play in the rain so you could go on the computer and play games. Talk to friends. Or you could use the computer for school work or for work. Say that you have to look something up for school and you can't get to the liebery, but you have a computer at your house. You can use it to find info. You can use the computer to learn how to do something like making somthing and a lot more. You can use the computer after school if you cann't go out and hang with your friends. You can do something with them online. Last things you can ask your friends if there is homework so you don't miss it. So that is why I support advanes in technology.",8
47,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students in @NUM3 grade go on the computer each night to complete homework and to connect with friends and family? I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. A computer can be used for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. Now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend who I was very close to and a part of his life. Unfortunately, he had to move away. But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. The computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @CAPS5 stay in touch. Different types of communication on the computer can be e-mail, instant-messaging, video chat, online chat groups...etc. This helps people stay connected. That's why I think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer. But, a computer can also be used for learning. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. For example when my class researched different things about the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our main source of infromation was the internet on our computers. We researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. Also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it. This is teaching them hand-eye coordiantion, and how to type. The computer is not @CAPS5 used for just communication. It's a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. ""@CAPS6 and adults often check their e-mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy, ""says expert @PERSON1. I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. For example, it can tell us about the series of shootings goiong on throughout @LOCATION1 or the many house robberies in our town. Us, @CAPS7 citizens, wnt to know everything... for us to stay safe and notified on the latest. Another example is that I logged on the computer three dats ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. But there are so many benefits of a computer. The effects computers have on people are beneficial. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news. I think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone.",11
48,"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers are an extremely useful tool in society. It helps people learn new things about different cultures. Also, it lets you communicate with friends and family through the internet, for example, using facebook or @CAPS1. Finally, it provides an accurate research tool for school projects, or interviews. First, learning about different cultures helps the world stay together. For example, here, we learn @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. Each class teaches us to respect more and more of this culture. However, some people don't have the chance to get this land of education, so they turn to the internet. If the computer didn't exist, we might not know about the lifestyle @NUM1 mi away from us. We wouldn't know if their lifestyles are extremely difficult or luxurious. Also, we wouldn't know if we could help them or not. For example, the earthquake in @LOCATION1 which. It's one step closer to world peace no more war or conflicts. Secondly, the computer helps you communicate to friends and family for in the world. I remember one time I was mailing my family friends who was in @LOCATION2, risking his life. I knew he couldn't come back to town, so I started to email him, and video chat with him. Whenever I saw his face, I knew that everything was okay. I don't know how I would have without the internet. Other ways lived you could as. Also, just communicating with friends! internet sites, like extremely useful. Finally, you use the computer for educational use. For example, research projects, study tools and essays. Whenever that a research is the internet. This extremely reliable and accurate. However that some of the websites are fake, which is easy to great research to use for school projects. Also, I know many teachers in my school have a blog or page where they put their @CAPS4 on, study links, and handouts, just in case we lose them. Whenever there is a test coming up, my @CAPS2 teacher, @CAPS5 would have links on her go to help use study. Also, is another website that helps us study for vocab. It also has many games that and learn our vocab words. As you can see, the computer helps us in our daily use and makes a positive impact on our society. From educational purposes, to learning cultures and socializing with friends it helps us get through life. As very successful newspaper and people, I assume you will understand how much the computer has made a positive effect in society.",12
49,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are benefitual to society. This because computers do tasks such as helps research, communicating with others, and has fun games and websites. Computers are really great sources for whatever you trying to do. Honestly, a @CAPS2 without computers I wouldn't know what to do. Computers are like digital encyclopedias, which has just about all the information your looking for. Computers have databases or websites design to have with research just as the do. Say that you have a essay due tommorrow and you need quick and valid information you can simple go to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 which is a computer database. Your end up with saild facts to help with your final draft. So, you wouldn't have to go that far to research. Communicating is something else the computer helps with. For example email and @ORGANIZATION1 is a way to communicate. Email is where you can send a message and a wait a reply while on the other hand @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 is where you get @ORGANIZATION1 replys. The latest thing in the communicating @CAPS2 is video chating. This where the person your chatting with can hear and see exactly what your doing. This is useful for families who life a good distance from each other. Computers play many roles and being used for fun is one. the @CAPS5 has many fun gaming websites such as @CAPS6.com miniclips.com, and @LOCATION1. This websites help take your mind off a bad day. You can also buy computer games for your computer. A very popular game is The @CAPS7. This game is base around your charater and the life you chose for it to live this game can take you to mother place where all your stress just fade away. So, computers betters society in many different ways. A few include research, communication, and to have fun. The computer is a very enhanced tool to enrich ones life. Computers take on difficult tasks and usually succed. So, computers are truely one thing we need.",8

Schools should use computers because its the best way to get the information that you need to do something. Like science, math, or history homework. Or even just for fun or to learn something new that you never knew before. You should agree with me because everything I rote down was true and almost the best wat to get pictures or any information. That you need to do something. Or even just to talk to a friend that you havent seen in awile.",8
52,"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing a letter to you to explain why I think computers are not good to have. My three supporting reasons are that if you are on the computer all the time there's a chance that you might gain weight and becom obese. You would rather be on the computer than to hang out with your family, and lastly you won't have any friends to talk to. Please read on to hear my story. First of all if your always on the computer your not going to get up and go outside for a little because it won't be important to you. Also your going to have to eat and when you get exited your going to want to eat more. Then you'll start getting overweight because you don't want to exercise. Secondly, you would spend less time with your family. You would think that your going to hang out with them later. So then you play more and get addicted. So then you and your family would grow apart. And you would be lonely because you gave up your family just so you can play a game on the computer. For my last reason on this matter is that you wont have friends. I think you won't have friends because if your on the computer all the time you wont even bother to go to the park to play or go to the gym, to try to get into sports then you won't meet anyone. The only friends that you would most likely have is friends on the computer. That you will never meet in real life and won't socialize to the about there life and to hang out with. In conclusion I think it is not a good idea to have a computer because you can become obese, you will spent less time with your family, and you won't have any friends to talk to. I hope you enjoyed this letter and take it into consideration.",8
53,"Coumputors are mind browning on what they can do. They can make or break somone financhely. They also can perduce amasing graphis that aritist cant perduce. Coumputrs are also for great for recer antal acitivitys, and they also take your life away. I not talking about a real life @CAPS1 talking about the activitys you do away from home. Now lets see the benifits and problems we come so far on how we handle money. We use to put it in chets and hide them now all we do is click and type in a securty number. people can also invist in items but invisting is tricky you dont always win. You can win small or lose big they say @CAPS2 coumputers today are hd. The screens are made of a liquid crystal fourmula that hardens. The lights in the back pixels do most of the wort to bring stunning graphis to life. On coumputers today people make money by selling graphis they made on coumputers. So this would be another plus on what a coumputor dose to a human. I went to a school to lern how to perduce great graphis. All teens kids and adults have used a coumputer for recerantol acivitys. On todays coumputors you can play games watch videos, and listen on coumputors. People do this to engoy then selfs. Some people ran get in trouble for fooling around on the web. But there is nothing stressed out and just playing some games for a while, personly I like to go on youtube and find funny vidos after school. I use to own a youtube account and get many views. The worst thing about coumpurts is it can ruin plan gobo or somones socal life some people get addicted and cant stop being on the coumputor until it is takin away. For example some people play world of war craft get addicted and cant stop! I had a problem when I had to chek you tube a lot. Well I hoped you readers. No matter what happens I think coumputors bennafit more than the problems",8
54,"I believe computers are a good thing for several reasons. Three reasons why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. You can also use them to meet new people. Finally you can also use them for planning. My first reason why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. My parents use e-mail all the time. They taly to my grandparents, then friends, and even use it to arrange events with other people. My use it when people are hurt and I know some people use it to learn about magazine subscription and other thing to buy. My favorite thing is that my parents use e-mail to talk with my grandparents about my birthday presents. My second reason why computers are a good thing to have is that you can use them to meet new people. I know there are alot of websites that match you with someone based on what you like and do. You can also use e-mail to talk to friends and they @MONTH1 want to see you again and you can meet people that way. Therea are thousands of ways to meet new people. You can use chat websites or you can use sites like facebook or myspace. My third and final reason why computers are good is that you can use them to plan a vacation or move dining reservations. For example me and my family went on vacation to @LOCATION1, and my mom made all the reservations from our computer at home. My parents aren't the only ones. Many people travel dening vacation, and propbably @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people use a computer to reserve hotels. I also wanted to take you to the other side without computers. If we don't have computers we would have do send mail through the post office and by the time that gets to your house someone could have new baby could have been born. Plus we would also find up doing bills and taxes without computer software. My parents life and my life would be very hectic if we didn't have computers. Once again I believe computers are good and that more than half of america use them. I believe this because you can use them to talk to other family that @MONTH1 be far away. You can meet new people through online dating services. Then theres the always helpful panning part, so you go online and reserve a hotel on dinner at a resturaunt. Plus if we didn't have computers we would have to do bills and taxes the old fashioned. My where you add up and subtract and divide. It's alot less words if you use a computer.",8
55,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers do have a positive affect on people but I don't think because of computers is the reason people don't exercise or enjoy nature. People make their own choices in life. The computer is just there. If somebody chooses to be on the computer instead of spending time with their family well thats their choice and problem not the computers. Me for example I love working and playing on the computer. Even though I'm on the computer I still do things like talk to my family, I play basketball, and I chill with my homies. Now thats my choice to do all of that. I can easily just sit up in my room and be on the computer all the time. It's nothing wrong with doing that because that is my choice in life. Nobody should be able to tell you to get off the computer because that is your choice in life. If you want to be on the computer instead of going outside thats your choice. Only you know what is best for you.",7

57,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion about computers is that they benifet people. they help people when they need it, it gives people entertainment. So that is why computers benifet people. @CAPS1 first reason is that a computer can help people when they need help like for instace if you have to write a paper and you need to look something up such as reseach you can use the computer or if there is a long main cwayshion then you can look up the formula. So as you can see that is why computer benifts people @CAPS1 second resson is that it gives people entertainment, such as myspace, you twitter. And those are social networks, if you like to watch tv. or listen to music there are websites for them also. So that is why I said computers give you entertainmen too. @CAPS1 third resson is that it helps people such as if you in different contries and you can't go see them you to them through instans or web cam. Or if you are home schooled and you dnt see other kids your age that can talk to the on the computer. So as you can see that why I say you can through the computer. So as you can see that is why I say computer are very benifical be cause they give you entertainment they let you communicate and they help people so.",6
58,"Dear, @CAPS1 I am writting this article on computers to inferm you my oppinun on computers positive and negotive efects. The reason why computers are so succsesful is beacuse of some of the great imformation they. Such as directions to a place until you are going to or home imformation on a subject or a pearson. Althoug these all sound good any one can post imformation on the internet so some imformation misnt not all be accrate. Some reasons why the computer is bud is beacuse of signs wich are not safe and can give your pearsonal imformation to a and comeing back to bud you in the future. Also webite or pop up icon are not suttebul for younger kids and exposeing them to to mature for them. Lastly talking on the computer is apart of our everyday lives such as emails almost every american whita computer here. A email, this is a great to relie or. Also the new sorse of web witch giving you the ability to see peaple and into the computers wich is raipidly growing in the @LOCATION1 @CAPS2 all in this article this you my point of veiw on computers.",8
59,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 all the talk about computers these days I would have to agree with the people who think its taking up alot more of our time. I hardly ever see people playing outside anymore because apparently computers are far more entertaining then being with your friends and family. Why do you think the obesity is so high these days? Well theres one of the reasons and I @CAPS5 when my parents were kids that they had no computers and they went outside to enjoy nature. Computers have there ups and downs but I do not think they benifit out society, first reason being, computers are taking away time to be with our friends and family. I rember when facebook and @CAPS6 werent created those were the days when people actually did fun things with there friends and family. there was a recent study that snowed since @DATE1 to @PERCENT1 of all americans use computers more than @NUM1 @CAPS2 a day for all sorts of diffrent reasons. I think mainiy computers were invented to make reason easier but now adays all we use them for is social networking. My second biggest point as to why computers do not benifit our is because over the past @NUM2 years the obesity rate has gone up by @PERCENT3 and due to what cause? eating un healthy food and sitting in front of your computers all day not exersiing. I am almost @PERCENT2 sure that if people stoped using computers that our world would be a healthier place. dont you feel bad for those people who are stuck being ovwrsized for there whole life because of these habits? I @CAPS5 most people would feel bad. My last reason is that we have this ahmazing planet that no one seems to enjoy anymore becaus they use up all there time on computers if only people got out every once and a while they would relize they have been wasting where time. there been a recent study that says @PERCENT4 of people are inside doing nothing all day! thats more than half!! I hope this will change somtim soon because computers hace only created a nusence to people and now it seems like no one has any type of a life.. computers hace spread to all sorts ofs societys but please let it not take over this friendly town of @CAPS1.",9
60,"Dear @CAPS1, I think that computer are a waste of time, but they also help you in many ways. You should only go on the computer if you really have too. Peple are on the computer for hours at a time, they go on the computer if they are bored or if they don't want to go outside. People have made the computer daster and more effective. So more and more people buy computers each year. Computers als helsp you in al of ways, you can learn from a computer, you can find a job on the compter, and you can also shop on the computer. So if you need to find a job then you can go on the computer and find a job that is right for you. You can learn from the computer. The computer can give you so much information it is unbeleiveable, you can look up anything and even ask questions. Last, you can shop on the computer. Say you can find something in a store and you looked everywhere so you go home and you can go on the computer and find what you are looking for. But, you most likely are going to need a credit card. So this is why I think computer are helpful but a waste of time.",6
61,"The topic that is on many minds in our country is, ""Are computers beneficial, or harmful to our students?"" @CAPS1 have evolved from dosktop computers, and before that, type writers, but have they gone too far? While the blank screen of a computer @MONTH1 distract some, the benefits defin out weigh the bads in a situation like this. Being able to have faster research, easier communicating and computers in wartime are great capabilitys of the modern computer. Also, due to advancement in technology, computers are very helpful because they help @LOCATION4 with our daily lifes. Many doubts about the computer exist, but the computer can surpass all of them. In a time crunch situation like college or high school, speed is everything. Computers allow students to research faster, and with more accuracy by being able to search for key words. Before, students would have to do the painstaking process of searching in books. More times than not, they wouldn't find what they were looking for, but with the modern age, students can get the information they need fast. Also, having computers in the classroom helps so that teachers can get the info they need for an upcoming class. If speed is what you need, then you will look for a computer. Besides speed, computers also give you another great thing, communication. With emails, @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and blogs, knowing what your friends are doing later is just a click away! This is much easier than calling the person. Also having this access to friends can help when one moves away. If you miss a long lost friend or cousin, just search their name, and you can talk to them! Having friends so close by you can really make every life great. Out in @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION1, solgiers rely on computers for valueable information; such as radar, or robots. Having computers do the ""dirty work"" can help in times of war, and can save valuable lives. Not having these computers would mean certain death for some people in the @LOCATION4 armed forces. Computers some times take the place of humans in things such as @ORGANIZATION1's, or unmaned airieal vehical and some many lifes too. Weather it be facebook or bombings, computers help in a vital way. It was @DATE1 and @PERSON1's communist regime was ruling new @LOCATION2. One man stood in front of a tank, resisting to move, showing courage and wanting a democracy. Fortuneatly, this was all caught on film. How was it broadcasted to the world? Using the computer, and internet. Today many people are able to learn about that due to computers. In many ways computers help @LOCATION4 with our daily lives and for most of @LOCATION4, without them, we would be lost.",11
62,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 you imagine where the world would be without computers? Our daily lives would be dull and boring without new technology. Computers help society do various activities that would be impossible if we didn't have computers. They give us the ability to learn at home, connect with other people, and give a source of entertainment. From these reasons our lives because easy and convenient, which is what @CAPS2 people strive to accomplish. The ability for an average person to learn has greatly increased. It has gone from just being able to go to school to the @CAPS2 various ways to increase your intelligence on the computer. Programs such as @ORGANIZATION1, which teaches people how to speak a language, are available on the computer. These programs are like going to school, but more accesible to the public.

Even if you go to school a computer @CAPS1 still help you excel in you work @CAPS2 sources of research are available on the computer and you like to the web a computer is a great place for fun.

63,"Dear editor, I believe that computers are a great and fun tool. But I also believe people can spend to much time on them. The computer is excellent. People can use them to type papers or reports, makes graphs, and other important things for us. Schools are using computers more and more now. Schools have websites for students to go to findout there homework, classwork, projects, reports, and extracredit. The school has even started doing something very new, allowing parents and kids to check the students grade online. Not only do the schools help students, but also everyday people help as well. if a student has a project but doesn't know how to start it then he or she can google there project and ways to start it. Computers can be real great and easy to use as you can see, for schoolwork. Computers are not only great for academic purposes, but also for leisure purposes. Before computers and internet, there were only these ways to have fun during boring times in the day. One was watching tv, reading a book, or going outside, if you could. What do I mean by that last sentence? If you lived in a city, then it would be harder to go outside because maybe you lived in an apartment or somewhere not a comunity. Then you couldn't go out; and reading books can become boring after a while, and maybe there was nothing on tv for you to watch. But when computers and internet cameout, people sould play games, watch videos, and talk to cousins or family who live far away. Computers are also good for social networks. Not all familys live close, but are a close family. But in this ec onomy we can't always afford to visit them whenever. So by using computers we can @CAPS1 them facebook them, ,myspace them, and even video chat with them, which as I said is great far away family. But at times people can become to obsesed with them. Some people spend all day on one website, particulary facebook or youtube. Do not get me wrong, these websites are fun and cool. But not cool enough to not go outside and have free, natural fun. I remember I logged into facebook and saw a girl on, I logged off around an hour later and she was still on, then I logged in again around @TIME1 and the same girl was on! That is just to long to be on one website. Computer are a great tool for humans to use for business, education, and leisure. But to much is not good.",10
64,"I belive the reason why people use the computer so much is because most people might have to work on the comptuer or mabey even finish a project. But I understant the part when the artical said ""Some experts are concerned that people are spending to o much time on their computes and less exercising"". Mostly young teens use the computer at a earley age and become hooked, because there are so many things to do on the computer like download games for free and play with other. People around the world but you would think that anybody would play video game on the computer and have free time? NO! Most adults don't play games on the computer, they do work or reasearch an artical. But after that they'll continue doing their daily routine, but alot of teens are on the computer everyday and rarley get exercise. The internet has open alot of new enchanced technology, over the past few years you could search up old friends from mabey old schoold on the web or even chat with people who you don't know from all over the world. You could have an @NUM1 @CAPS1 and buy new song or new albums insted of going to a local store, or even shop online have have the cloths been brought to you.

65,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you want our society to becaome one of obese, lazy with no appreciation for family or friends? @CAPS2 you want people to lock a respect for nature? This is the result of excessive of computer usage our society will become lazy, and dependent upon robot slaves and loose, brain washed. People will not be caring for family or friends. Most importantly, our society will have no appreciacion or respect for mother nature. Is this the way you wish our world to be? Have you ever read @CAPS3 @NUM1? In the book, the government uses technology to brainwash people and then manipulate them. If our society, like the one in the book, becomes over dependent on computers and technology, then we will collapse from the inside going from a respected world power, to a third world country in. We will need to redesign buildings to have doors big enough for our bodies to fit through. We will not be a respected nation anymore. There will be charities in other countries to send money to build gyms and pools, but nobody will use they. Recent research from @ORGANIZATION1 says that @PERCENT1 of people who spend more than an hour and a half on their computer every day are over @NUM2 pounds. People won't remember how to talk. Babies will learn to type instead of talking or walking. Is this good for our country? People say that the best thing you could ever have is a supportive family and a group of good friends. According to @PERSON1, a well known psychologist, ""People who have more friends have a @PERCENT2 reduced risk of depression."" Friends actually affect you health. People who use the computer too much lose friends and became separated from their families. The mental health effects from this can be horrible, and people sadly will miss out on all the positive parts of life. It's important that people are happy, but if you onlr communicate through e-mail and social networking sites, you aren't social enbough. It is one thing to chat online, but it is better to be able to see someone face to face than a picture on screen. Nobody wants to end up like this, so limit oyur computer usage. With too much computer usage comes a lack of respect for nature, People used to care nature for many reasons, but the biggest is that it affects us everyday, in everything we @CAPS2 and own. Everything has a base in nature, even ourselves. The weather outside even on a beautiful @DATE1 day, can be deadly if we don't pay attention to what is going on outside of our safe house. We depend on nature but if we don't respect her, she will kill us. Anything is good in moderation, even a computer. But when we don't limit ourselves, it has bad consequences. We will no longer have a respected society. Our family and friends will dissapear, causing health problems. Worst of all, we will lose all expectation and respect for mother nature. The time to start limiting computer usage is now, or we will have many great problems.",10
66,"Dear local newspaper, I am here today to state my reason why I am against usage of computers. My @NUM1 reason why I am against usage of computers is, the negativity, like for example too many pop ups come on the website your own and then they mini little advertisments like ""@CAPS1 on me"" ""free trial"". And thats not good for children to see when they are using the computer. My seocnd reason why I am against using computers is who's online when your up there. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people use the computer every single day and @NUM3 out of @NUM5 people be up there chatting with young little girls and boys. And they older what then what they say. What I'm trying say is these people are called ""@CAPS2"". These people roam through the internet day and night trying to find little boys and girls. Just like I say earlier thats not good computer usage. The purpose of getting on the computer is look for information or play games no that other stuff. My final reason of being against computer is montoring, alot of parents dont watch their kids when they are on the computer, so most of the kids look at a lot of inapproiate sites or things that they shouldn't look at. And that be their fought beacuse they should have parental lock up there. In conclusion, basically what I am trying to say is computers can be dangerous sometime because you dont always know what your clicking on and you can @CAPS1 on the wrong thing and end up on a site that you don't want to be on. So just have my opinions and maybe you can understand what I'm trying to say. Thanks.",8

Can you picture @CAPS1 person in your town blind and having glasses or even going to the @CAPS1 @DATE1? Just ask eye @PERSON1,"" @CAPS1 year I get and more people coming to the eye doctors. You might say that it is good for me but it is not good for you. When you are always on the computer it erodes you eye-sight over time.

It went up almost @PERCENT2 from @DATE1 year and @PERCENT3 from the year before. Almost everyone that has a computer and is addicted to it has glasses. Have you looked outside lately? Have you notice that @DATE2 is coming and there is leaves on the tree now? If you were one of the people that is glued to the monitor of your computer then I doubt you were. Computers and technology ruin your time with your family. Many jobs on the computer how out it isn't a @NUM1 job. In that time you could be spending time with your precious little girl or even the best friend out side in nature having fun. @DATE1 year I wanted to play catch with my dad, but was on his old computer doing what he does.

Yes, people would rather be a couch potatoe and chat online, eating a bug of a million junk food chips instead of going out and interacting while slaying fit, but now it is important that you do. Just picture lazy, obese. People sitting on their couch all day with their eyes blood from stearing at the monitor for hours. But why do you than you @MONTH1 ask, it is because they never some outside. They never go for a jog or eat healthy foods. That is very unhealthy and can higher your chances of getting different cancers. Just ask @PERSON2 from the hospital,"" @DATE1 one guy was rushed to the hospital because of a very common cancer that you get from unhealthy living, he passed away @NUM2 days later. It was very sad."" I strongly believe that being on the computer to long is a very bad idea. It can ruin you eye-sight, you never get to see nature and interact. But most importantly, it is very unhealthy. It is now or never, You would never know if you can be that man in the hospital with that cancer. The issue to grapple with is should you take that risk or stay fit, healthy and happy? So take a joy, eat a healthy, snack, and limit your time on the computer.",9

69,"Computers can be very useful to people. They can help contact friends and family from all over the world. You might need it for typing a paper for school or work, and you can use the internet. If you had a friend or family member move away, computers are an easy way to contact them. Phones dont always give you that option to call from around the world. Say your bestfriend moved out of the country you could email them or instant message them through computers. What if you want to chat with someone right next door even if theres a blizzard and the snow is four feet, computers are a simple way to contact them. When my friend went to @LOCATION1 for the @DATE1 I used instant messaging to talk to her. Imagine your at work or school and you were asked to write a five page essay. Do you really want to write it all? Imagine you, writing out hundreds of those newspaper everyday. Typing is an easy solution that doesnt require as much work and it takes less time. Typing also makes work a lot neater and easier to read. Not even a library has all the information you need. What if you need to write an article for your newspaper about a newly discovered animal? A library wont immediately buy new books about it. The internet is an ideal way to get information the moment it happens. What if a celebrity got hit by a bus or a rocket in space just landed sucesfully? You cant expect to go to the other side of the country to watch and take notes. The internet gives information on anything possible. The internet also allowes students to take online schools or classes. When my oldest brother couldnt take @CAPS1 in high school when it was needed for college, he took an online @CAPS1 class at home. The internet also helps you find vacation spots when your going away from home what if you need a plane, train, boat ticket? What if you need to rent a car but you cant go over to the store or airport. You can go online to purchase tickets. Have you ever heard someone say ""@CAPS3 it upon google"" when they dont know the answer to something? I remember my friend telling me about her new dog, I never even heard of. When I got home I went on the internet and researched it. The internet is a very useful tool to everyone. Going on a computer allows you to talk to anyone, anywhere, type anything needed, or to use the internet. The computer makes life a little easier and its fun too, and would be a handy tool for writing a newspaper.",10

I was reading your paper and I notice you had an article on how people are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time going outside, getting exercise, enjoying nature, and that it doesn't benifit society. i completly disagree with these comments. let me explain... Having computers definatly benifits for all students. Sometimes kids forget their text books at school. But if they have a computer, they can just google the information. That way they get there homework done, and don't have to take a zero. Another thing is, I am sure you have heard of a website called, study island. If you havn't, i'ts a website for all the students in the @LOCATION1 to take online courses for math, reading, and science. They are time consuming, but they count for a huge chunk of our grade. So, if we get an @CAPS2 on study island we get an @CAPS2 in one of our classes.. Not only does the computer help students but it helps me in a kind of personal way. I love the piano. But, there are no instructions in my area. However, there is a program on the computer called synewnisia. It helps you learn all kinds of songs on your keyboard or piano. The piano helps my hand-eye coordination as well as it teaches discipline and dedication. Now, synewnesia isn't the only free instrument learning program. There are many others! This helps people who can't afford lessons, and learning an instrument can help you acheive things later in life. Now, one thing you said in your article is that people aren't getting enough exercise because of sitting in front of a computer all day. This is not completly true. In fact, most people go on the computer researching diet plans or local gyms. How do I know this? Well one day when I went on google the top search of the day was, ""weight watchers diet plan"". Also, my mom uses an online video workout website, for her bad back. So not only does the computer help for diets, they can help physical therapy also. So with this letter I hope you realize that the computer does benifite our society, yes, we should not spend too much time on it. But, online learning sessions can be time consuming. It helps many people figure out the right deit and workouts so they can stay happy and healthy.",10
71,"Dear @CAPS1 Society: Computers are perhaps one of the greatest improvements to our societies advancement in knowledge in the past few decades. These gems of future, are like a human being; they have their own mind and can figure out answers to all problems. People all around the world use them, from @LOCATION5 to @LOCATION4, to @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1, they are being used. People from ages of school kids, to adults who have a job so highly appreciated as a chemist, use computers! Do you wish to be that one standing on the side lines, stuck in the past, not advancing with technology? From the creations of rockets, engines and planes; computers have never let us down. Still, the question is this: will computerized technology benefit our society or crash it down? Ever since the @DATE1, computers have been used as an ad for new information. The speed that they are able to recieve new information in is just astonishing! @CAPS2 @PERSON2, computer engenieer, says ""With the technology that we recieve from computers, we are able to be in the game."" @CAPS2 just comes to show one of the best benefits of computers: their ability to display the most current information. Now, I can see how books are an excellent resource in society, and how they provide for amazing information, however it takes years to publish books! With the use of a computer, information that occured sometimes as close to @NUM1 hours ago can appear on the internet! Not only will this allow you to get information faster, but it will allow our society to ""be in the game."" You catch a football as it soars through the air, you track a baseball or it flys high in the sky, you grasp the face of a basketball all because you have ""hand-eye"" coordination. Hand-eye coordination is perhaps one of the most neccessarry aspects of life that a person can have. Face it, everybody needs it! So why not help your body to get that talent: buy a computer. Imagine, our society would advance in it's sports and even just with life if they learn how to coordinate themselves. Did you know that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people who owned a computer and typed daily were able to catch all three tennis-balls that were thrown at them! You could do that too! When typing on a computer, human development observers states, your eyes a free tracked on the screen and you train your hands to manuvor about the keys all by themselves. Just as in basketball, when you train your hand to track the bounce of the ball without you needing the need to catch it. I can remember when I started typing, my hands began to naturally find the keys without me having to look at them. And the next day at basketball practice I felt like @CAPS3 amazing point-guard @PERSON1, the ball just came straight to my hand! Get this need of life, invest in a computer! Money @MONTH1 be the most vital thing in our society right now. With profits as low as medium wage, our local area is not that ""rich."" I can see how it could be hard, having to purchase these computers at prices as high as @MONEY1 each. But then just think, each book that we won't have to purchase would save us @NUM4 each. Not only do computer's stand to last @NUM5 longer than any paperback, their information is always new, changing, and up-to-date. In order for us to be purchasing new books because of recent information would end up coasting as more in the long-run. Our neighboring society of @LOCATION3 just invested in over @NUM6 comptuers for their society. The stated that it took onlyt @NUM7 months to get the money back that they had purchased on the computer's with the amount that had not purchasing book! Now just imagine how much money our society would gain after @NUM8 year! It is necessary for our society to have computers. With them we not only learn hand-eye coordination but we invest in more money for the. And now with so many things happening in the world it is important to recieve information instantely from these computers. I can't stress enough that without them we just @MONTH1 be less in the rest. Dreams of incrediable rockets and medicines and cures far diseases just won't happen. Computers rise perhaps the only thing that actually benefits our society. You must understand how important this technology is to our society! But, int the long-run, the decision is yours is make. Choose quickly, the fate of our society is in your hands.",12
72,"I believe that computers are a great invention. It lets people interact with people from very far off places. Has lots of fun games you can play. And it is also a great way to learn information on topics and places very far off. Being able to talk to relatives from far away places is very important. @PERCENT1 of experts say that having a close knit family will give kids a greater chance of going to college. I understand why some people think ""well why doesn't the "" I grew up in a big family and just the whole day the phone was getting used. The computer has a lot of fun games that you can play. I see why you might think that the computer is why kids are over-weight But isn't the hour on the computer. Its eating habbits. Studies show that computers are use in the winter two time as much then. Going on the internet to learn new information is a great way to useing your souce. Just imagine this you straight A student comes home for the weekend about to do the biggest project lige forgets to bring home the most important book. She is flipping out looking all over the place and hyperventalating. But if you had a computer your daughter would be able to get the proect done and go to the college of her dreams. But since you didn't buy a computer she is going to fail her class not accepted to harvard and settle for the local community college where maybe one day she will be able to transfer. So I've gave you reasons to go out and but a computer you just lost to go do it. Do you want your kids to interact with aunt sally who lives @NUM1 miles away. Also it is a great way to play games. And lastly you want your daughter to go to yale or do you want her to fail. I have give yous you the facts the rest is up to you.",8
73,"Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that computers benefit society very much. I believe so fo various reasons that I will state through out this passage. Although sometimes people spend too much time on computer it doesn't mean computers are bad for society it just means people need to learn to spend their time wisely. Overall I think computers have a positive effect on society. One reason I am for computers is because they are a huge advancement in technology. They are able to make everyday life easier. They allow you to store information. Learn about many places, and communicate with friends and family. For one device to do all that is amazing! Also if we can make something like computers imagine all the other possibilities of technology advancements. Computers are only the start of it all! Anouther reason why I believe computers greatly benifit society is because they provide entertainment. You can watch movies on your computer, and download fun games. There is hardly anything you can't do on a computer. If it is cold outside or raining you can still entertain yourself with just a computer. Computers are very great to have around. Now anyone who thinks people spend too much time on their computer and that computers are bad for society is just wrong. I think those people are wrong because a computer can't force you to spend more time on it. It's your own fault if you choose to use your computer too much. You always have the choice to go outside and take a walk. Computers are only wrong if you choose to use them wrong, like the expression ""guns don't kill people, people do."" In conclusion I believe computers are a great thing to have espicially in this modern society. Computer are one of the greates advancements in technology and they benifit society as well. So if you are ever wondering weather or not to buy a computer I suggest you get one!",8
74,"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently discovered that you are debating the computeres have on people. In my opinion I would think they have a neutral effect on people. In this day and age computers are used for many things. Research, communication act. maybe the reason young people so much time in the computure is because they have a lot of home work on the computer, ""@CAPS2 this"", ""@CAPS2 that"", people don't relize to pass we have to go on the computure. And for adults when you work with big companies you work with people all around the world. Instead of fixing to all these meetings you can simply do it over webcam. Yes, I see your concern that people spend too much time inside on their computure but what about people who love to read or play music, they could spend hours upon hours practicing or reading. What is the difference? And you never know maybe being on the computure for someone is lik a sport for another. Computoras are just about anywhere houses, schools and even crime & medical labs. Computure or a prime source of the data base, of @CAPS4, criminal records and so much more. With out computures how could catch the bad guy or catch the cancer before it's too late. Computure are key in many things. in the end you could go all day about the pros & cons of computures. But there so key in major aspects today, the pros out weigh the cons.",7
75,"Dear Local Newspaper, The effects computers have on people as posotive I say that it is posotive because what if your in a rush, and you don't know if you need your rain boots or not? Check the computer! I say that it is posotive because without the computer how would most offices run their buisness? It's too much of a pain to keep everything on files. Especially in schools because the teachers don't keep their grades for students in a filing cabinet! They keep them on the computer, @CAPS1 they'd need a huge filing cabinet. I could understand why some peole think computers have a bad effect on people. They might think that it takes away time from nature, friends and family. But so many people take their laptops to the local park to sit under a tree on warm days and go on the computer there. Especially students do this, they do their homework under the leaves to help them relax. Also, people whose family or friends live in other states, they @MONTH1 not have the house number, or they don't have time for a long conversation, they can e-mail them, or use social networking like facebook, or myspace to look on their profile pages and say a quck, ""@CAPS2, how are you doing?"" Local shop owner @PERSON1 says, ""I barely have time for myself! So when I want to say @CAPS2 to my sister in @LOCATION1, I usually say hello on facebook because I know how she loves to talk my ear off!"" I remember one morning, when I was rushing before school, I had no idea what type of outfit to wear. I checked the local news casting website for the weather forecast and thank god I did! I would have gotten stock in downpour without an umbrella! Computers are also good for if you want to catch up on any news, or just relax and play some games you can. So, if your wondering about the weather to see if today will be a good day to sit under the trees in the park & catch up on typing that report with your partner, then go ahead. But don't forget to e-mail her and ask her first, since you lost her phone number.",8
76,"@ORGANIZATION1, @DATE1, people have been doing less exercise and not enjoying the great outdoors. They're some people that are having less family and friends times. I say its computers!"" This machine is a great resource, but people are starting to get adicted to it. We need to reach a messgae to those people. Yesterday, I went to my local library and found @NUM1 computers in the library. All of the computers were filled with people and, a line with @NUM2 people ready to go on next. I ask those @NUM2 people ""why were they there?"" ""for homework"" said a teenager. Another, ""just to come and paly"". I also ask, ""how do they stay fit?"" ""I don't like @CAPS1 fit"" said beautiful lady. ""@CAPS1 fit isn't esay if your always on the computer"" said the teenager. The response I got from those people, were unbelievable. If we don't stay fit how are we going to survivie from all these dieases and cancer. This reason has pently to do witj not @CAPS1 fit. I don't know about you but I care about my family, I would never spend the rest of my life infront of a computer instead of my love ones. In the of , I was surprise to find out that projects, homework and research can take up half of your time, with your family. Do the computer, you can find some resort for you and your friends and fanily, you can't be doing for more than minutes. The great out doors should be one of the best places to be. because it quit, its amazing and its a large area. If you looking up the out doors on a computer, now thats a of time, that you could have been with a family member in the or where ever. My father says its great to buit its to live it. The days are getting shorter lets live it like.""",8
77,"Computers are used everywhere, for thousands of different things. Many of @LOCATION1 spend hours glued to our computer screen everyday. Being very reliant on your computer is not always good for you. @DATE1 too many people spend countless hours on their computers, rather than doing other activities. Therefore, computers are not the best way to spend your time because you get less excersize, your school grades can lower, and your communication skills will weaken. First, when spending days on your keyboard you will have less time to run or play with your friends. In the @LOCATION1 @DATE1, many more people are becoming obese, creating unhealthy genes to be passed on. Perhaps a reason for this is that too many people can just sit on their laptops to shop, see movies, and even to get a college education. Less and less people go for walks because they would rather be on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1. Without the constant use of computers there would be more free time for people to get outside, or play sports. Secondly, many kids and teens are attached to their laptop, and bring it everywhere with them. So, rather than studying for their tests, they could be on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1. Must chose to go on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1 rather than opening their books. Plus, spending so many hours on a computer. less time to do their homework, so they just begin to not do any of it. Computers take away their time that could be used towards getting a college education, why waste them? Lastly, why talk on the phone or in person when you can just send them an e-mail or chat online with them? Many people @DATE1 are staying inside on their laptops to talk to a person rather than doing it face to face. This can cause a lack of communication skills, something that might sound good online, could sound absolutely terrible in the ""real"" world. This loss of skill, could lead to a generation of more cyber talk rather than @CAPS3. In conclusion, why spend so many hours on the computer when you could be outside, or hanging out with friends? Personally I'd prefer to go and do something rather than being stuck inside on a computer.",8
78,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 computers become more and more a part of everyday life people begin to question wether or not they have a positive impact on people. Computers are a technological wonder that has a positive effect on people. The world wide web, unlimited socialization and simulations are just a few of the benefits of computers. The internet provides acess to the world wide we. Infinite amounts of information can be found on your computer. ""@CAPS2 in almost everyday school rely on the internet to gain information stated education secretary, @PERSON1. Also search engines provide acess to thousands of information loaded pages. In addition to unlimited information the web olds thousands of different web pages. With these people can learn about other peoples opinions or spend time playing games. The web is only one thing out of hundreds of great things about computers. Socialization is a huge of the moders life style. Web cames @CAPS1 on computers allow people to talk with friends who live miles away. No longer will people have to take an airplane to talk with friends on the other side of the world. Also, instant messaging and email is the main comunication system for thousands of people. It is the most efficient way to talk to friends. In fact, I became re connected with a lot of people I didn't talked to in a long time by getting email. Every body loves taking with their friends and family and this is made easier by using computers. Simulations are a huge benifit of computers. Many simulation programs are used to help people in their lives. Many proffessions using simulations on computers to help learn hot to do their job nine out of ten medical schools have the use of surgery simulations @CAPS1 part of their training course. Also, simulations and gaming on computers reveal interest for many people. I myself have a greater interest in history now after playing many historical themed computer games. Also many games and computer simulation have helped many people learn new things, @CAPS3 are countless learning games and simulations that are acessable by computer. Simulations add huge benifets to owning a computer. @CAPS1 technology advances people are opened up to many possibilities suck @CAPS1 information via the web unlimited socialization and simulations. The benifits of computers are many and the problems few. So, how can you keep up in a world where computer users hold the advantage if you deny the benifits of computers? Computers affect people in a positive way.",8
79,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern: I will agree that computers have caused many people to spend less time outside. However, it has kept kids inside instead @ORGANIZATION2 on the streets causing trouble. Computers have become a part @ORGANIZATION2 our everyday life. Some use it to stay connected with family or to reconnect with old friends. Experts say it's bad but the @ORGANIZATION2 gives us a computer class in @ORGANIZATION1? We learn keyboarding skills. @ORGANIZATION3 techniques and how to research any topic. @ORGANIZATION1, itself has influenced computer use. If we could travel back in time, we would most likely see kids hanging around the streets. Now-a-days, kids spend a lot @ORGANIZATION2 time inside, on the computers. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I bet you, or your parents, or maybe even your grandparents used to hear @ORGANIZATION2 gangs or fights going on in the streets. Now that computers have become an important item in many people's lives you don't hear those types @ORGANIZATION2 things as much. I'm not saying they don't happen but you don't hear your child come home and talk about gangs and fights. Therefore, being on the computer isn't that bad. In history you probably learned about immigrants coming over to @LOCATION1 to get away from their ruler. Well, not everyone was able to come. Some people have family in another country. Due to time difference, it is hard to stay in touch. My mother came over here when she was @NUM1. The rest @ORGANIZATION2 her family still lives in @LOCATION2. To stay in touch they email or @CAPS1 chat. The five hour time difference makes it difficult to know when to call. The invention @ORGANIZATION2 computers has made it easier to catch up with family! Most importantly, the use @ORGANIZATION2 computers is influenced in schools. My @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, has a computer class, where we learn how to skillfully type. We are also taught how to correctly cite and research work. This is helpful because if we don't know this information we could plagiarize and plagiarism is illegal. Frequently, teachers give us projects that ask for computer use.. Either we have to look something up for specific, accurate information or we have to type a @ORGANIZATION3 document. As well as using the the online @CAPS2 book instead @ORGANIZATION2 taking it home. After reading all the facts, I'm sure you will agree that computers can benefit society. Students stay off the streets and only cause trouble with siblings at home. People won't feel like they've left or lost their family. Schools influence computer use to help us learn. Certainly you cannot disagree with me!",10
80,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1 and I believe that computers have a negative influence on people. When people are on computers all day they have less time exercising. They are in alot more danger, and they spend less time with there family. These are my only some reasons why computers dontbenefit society.. In more, more time spent on computers equals less time exercising. With the obesity rate rising no one wants to be unable to do regular activitys. With spending all your time on the computer, you would just be using to get over weight and unhealthy. It also makes many people feel self consiou about themselves. If they dont have enough time exercising and keep eating they will become even more self consious. More over it will bring more danger to you and your family. There are many places on the internet where you can meet new people. But how do you know if people are who they seem to be? If you spend more time on the computer then you will increase your chances by @PERCENT3 to get a personal assuts, or even give you personal information up. So why should you take the risk? Just get off that computer! Even if you dont meet on internet assuter you will still be glued to your computer cauzing it more likley to be harrased. I definatly dont want that for my family. The last reason is the most important to @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 family. If you are spending all this time on your computer you will be out on in your family. This time is verry important because you never know when your family will be gone! And it is a verry scarry topic to think about. I know that most people in @LOCATION1 was spend all the time with there family. On another note a survey shows that @PERCENT2 of children that spend time with there family and less than @NUM1 minutes on the computer have grades higher than @NUM2 in all classes. Wouldn't you want to make the honnor role in your school? In conclusion, computers have a negiteve effect on people! Spending most time on your computer can causes less time spent exercising, more danger/harm to people, and less time spent with your family. Wouldn't you just rather spend less time on your computer? Thank you for your time.",9
81,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, Computers are destroying modern youth. The rapid advancement in technology is not a positive thing. The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. ""I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live."" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese.

One of the reasons f think computers have a bad effect on people is addictions. Their are many things people @MONTH1 get addicted to life facebook, myspace, formspring. another example, @CAPS2 my sister gets home first thing. She does is go on facebook, forming and youtube. My second reason who f think computers have terrible effect is because eye damage. @CAPS2 your staring at a computer screen for so long you don't notice but your eyes are getting damage. @CAPS2 f was in sixth grade I needed glasses because I was addicted to computer for so long and my eyes got damaged. My first reason @CAPS1 I think computers have terrible effect on people is because its a waste of time. @CAPS2 your at home on the computer and it's sum out you should be outside with friends, family, or even just a talking a walk, and it's also a waste of time because @CAPS2 your on computer you could also be instead. You might think they have positive effect yes, but they damage your body. these are the reason @CAPS1 I think computers have a bad effect on people.

85,"Dear editor: @CAPS1 you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the @LOCATION2 have comuters? These computers are definatley benefitting society. People need computers to get updated on important issues, contact others and learn new information. Computers are neccisary for everyday life. It's very important that news gets around, and one way for it to do that is by computers. Average people like me and you need to know the weather, global issues and many other important topics. If you use the computer to get updated on important issues you will be able to acess the information right away. For example there is no need to wait for the weather to come on the television when you can find out the weather for your local area withen seconds. Just recently there was an earthquake in @LOCATION1 and million of civilians died. if a natural disaster was to happen somewhere in @CAPS2 people would need to know and computers are a great way to make sure everyone is updated. Not only does the computer help us get important updates on global issues but it is also a great way to contact people. My relatives live very far away and we can't afford the long distance phone call charge and so we e-mail them. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people contact far away friends and family by e-mail! The computer is also a great place for friends to contact each other through social networking sites, such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. People need to interact with other people and the internet is a fantastic place to do that. Finally computers can also be used to learn new information. If children need to find inforamtion for a project or essay the can easily search the internet and find an answer. Kids need to acess the information that is neccisary for school on the internet. Computers are useful for adults as well. If adults want to learn something new all they have to to is search it on the computer. It's so much easier than going out to the library and finding that information in a book. @CAPS1 you know that most adults use an online dictionary to find the definition to a word? Computers can find every answer to your questions. In conclusion, computer are really benefitting society. Computers can update you on important issues, help you contact people, and find out new informatiuon. These avandces in technology are good for human society.",9
86,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that there is a big discussion going on about if computers have a possitive effect on people.

First, computers have a negative effect on people, including chicken, because computers are not safe.

These @ORGANIZATION1 websites that gives @CAPS3 the ability to talk with friends and play games have made @CAPS3 lazy and addicted to the computer. My friend, when he was little, would play outside for hours and hours at a time. He would play all different kinds of sports with his neighbor. Now @PERSON3 is older and all he does is sit on the computer until his parents have to force him off of the computer for dinner time. @PERSON3's grades have dropped tremendously and he has gotten very chubby compared to what he used to look like. Statistics show that more than @PERCENT2 of @CAPS3 have gained weight due to not exercising and their grades have dropped @NUM1 on @NUM2 grading scale. Dr. @DR1 Much says that, ""@CAPS3 have forgotten the fun in playing outside and lost the determination they had to do well in school. This is all because of these @ORGANIZATION1 computers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 now can go to any website do anything on that website."" @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want your @CAPS3 to gain weight and stop doing well in school? Lastly, computers have had negative effect on society because of money. Many families have spent thousands thousands of dollars on buying the computers and @CAPS1 them fixed. These @ORGANIZATION1 computers are crazy expensive. They range from @MONEY3@NUM3 for a @CAPS4 computer. Then each family had to buy the software and programs to go with the computer. A close family friend of ours just bought a computers. They bought a @CAPS5 that costs @MONEY2, on top of that, they spent @MONEY3 on all the programs they needed for the computer. This family cannot afford this computers but they think that they need one. @CAPS2 they have gone to the college fund for money. Now their kid has to go to a cheap school @CAPS2 their family won't go. Statistics show thas @PERCENT3 of families have waste their college money in computers because the family thinks they need a computer. Dr. @DR2 @CAPS6, ""families do not need computers, yet they waste their college money on them. @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1 do you think that money from a college fund is worth a computer? Computers are not worth @CAPS1 your children at.",11
87,"Hello everyone, I have heard how many people are basicly saying that computers are bad. That people are speanding to much time on computers and not enough time outside and being with family. But I'm writing you today to tell you about how great computers really are. First off, computers help technology so much. People can now do things that we could never do before. Things like chating to people across the sea without having to pay for @CAPS1 or even be there. Looking up ways to burn fat fast and diet programs. Uploading photos to share with other family and friends. And much, much more. Computers have helped so many people do so many things! Mostly good things by the way. Secondly, computers have helped us acomplish things that otherwise we couldn't have gotten done. Like go to the moon! Have cellphones! And some diseses were helped cured by using computers. Computers can be a little danguras to some people, who probley don't know how to use them right, but in a few more years all that can be fixed! We are getting more and more advantsed in so many ways, @CAPS1'@CAPS3 kinda crazy! I could go on and on, on so many more things that computers do for us, but there are not enough pages. Lastly, @CAPS1 is more easyer to do reasearch with computers. -And quiker to- @CAPS2 in my school we use our computers for learning purposes, and they help us very much. I've personly, learned a lot from computers. I even use them to get better at math for the @ORGANIZATION1'@CAPS3! We need them! (@CAPS4... I do at least) I'm even starting to learn another language -@CAPS5- with them. @CAPS1'@CAPS3 not to assume that every one who uses them are fat, lazy, and don't spend enough time with family and/or friends. Furthermore, please stop all of this nonsense, I really don't thing that spending to much time on computers is the thing that you should be worrying about right now. That is all I have to say. Bye.",8
88,"Dear @LOCATION1, I @CAPS1 believe that using computers has a benefit to the community. I believe this because using computers helps with research, jobs, and staying in town with people. First and foremost, the use of computers will tribute to better research. Most @CAPS2 dont have textbooks about @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 at home with them so they rely on the internet. When @PERSON2 gave the class a parket, I didn't know what some of the words meant. So i logged into my laptop and went on google, within seconds the definitions wore popping onto my screen like pop rocks. After I found out what the words meant, I finished my homework in about five minutes. Without the internet I don't know how long it would have taken. Equally important, using computers will allow a wider selection of jobs. @PERCENT1 of today's jobs in @LOCATION1 require some kind of computer work. some jobs require quick typers. some people type as fast as cheetah runs. Some jobs require people using @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 - Computers are a necessity to get a well - paying job. Lastly, using computers will open a gateway communication @CAPS7, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, etc are a few of the many ways to communicate online. if one of my friends doesn't have a phone, they most likely have a @CAPS7. @CAPS7 gives me a way to talk to, @CAPS11 photos with and leave videos for my friends. One @CAPS12 @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and I were all going to work on our @PERSON1 project. @PERSON3's phone was taken away so the only way I could talk to her was on @CAPS7. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 has a @CAPS7, @CAPS8, of @CAPS9? To @CAPS17, I hope you enjoyed reading about how using computers helps with research, applying for a job, and communicating with family and friends please @LOCATION1, @CAPS18 this in the Newspaper so all residents of @LOCATION1 will agree with me.",9
89,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 generation has grown up with the complex technology called computers. I have learned over the years of using them, that they aren't as helpful as the seem. They can cause an addiction, and create numerous distractions. First of all. many doctors say that computers cause ""the new depression."" The internet is where most of this takes place though. For most teenagers, having a facebook, myspace, or formspring is not unusual. I know from personal experiences, that some people abuse these social networks and use them as another way to bully people. So therefore, not only do you get made fun of in school, but now, people can make fun of you in cyberspace.. This is the main reason that people become socially depressed. There is almost no way to escape it and all of their anxiouty really starts to get to them. Addiction to computers is also a very negative impact. Many people go on the internet and are so fascinated that, that is how they spend their free time. About @PERCENT1 of people say that they are addicted. From @CAPS1 experience with using the internet. I know that there is always something that pulls you back in. You know that you are on addict when you spend more than an hour a day on the computer. Parents always say that it is a self-control issue but many adults have the same problem. They have just started to be able to use the computers, so many times they go through a phase or addiction. Furthermore, this addiction problem would be totaly gotten rid of it we stopped using computers. Finally, computers also create many distractions to students. When students sit down to type their papers they also, many times, have another at the same time. Therefore they are getting barely any work done. Social networks only just make this even worse. Constantly chatting with someone can cause tou to loose track of time. Also, when you try to multitask with the internet. Therefore causing grades to go down or not complete home work on time. All and all, this is an issue that can be easily avoided by eliminating computers. In conclusion, computers do not help us. They cause social depression, which cause people to have anxiouty problems. They cause addiction, which end up taking over peoples lives. They create divertion that make concentrating hard. I feel that computers have negative affects and they should be gotten rid of completely!",9
90,"Dear @LOCATION1, I understand this focus situation, the effect of computers or our society people's reactions are less than about them & my question to is who? Computers a very good effect on our town's specify. Computers areaids in tracking hand-eye coordination. They give people the opportunity to look at things & talk to that it traveled here they wallets empty faster than the speed of it. @CAPS2 also have the ability to help people so things that an than a pig sty. Let me explain more these reasons. Computers are very good for our society because they are kids in tracking hand-eye coordination to kids & adults. Just to help you understand why in to teach hand-eye coordination, @CAPS2 are so many that help you learn but help you learn will get you. In foot ball catching helps to teach the skill but makes you up on the ground after being by someone potentially yourself. In baseball swinging at a pitch to teach his skill, but if the is very close to you it could how you for the if you do the ball could someone & hurt them, ability to day back. Computers are great way to this skill in a saw Even @CAPS1 @PERSON1 here in town says that he has seen an of kids with better hand eye coordination, due to do have a good our town? Well, computers let people to that. You can talk to relatives in far away places but to travel with this. I'm sure that you're wondering if I have I do have another reason. Computers have to samethings electronically so fast easily, make a look on computer's hard drives, @CAPS2 are so much more that ran be on a computer, that make a room empty. Before my famiy had a computer complete dedicated to papers files that your so important & that we could not lose. When up got picture, typed up paper, saved our was empty! I hope that this letter has proves to you computers effect on our society. Computers help and in the process of hand eye coordination. The help to thing happen but if done on real life could faster of they also help to electronically than a. So now, after this letter you go out i publish this telling every good effects of computers. Again I thank you for reading this letter.",11
91,"Dear people, Computers have been here for not a very long time and everyday more people buy computers and everyday people use them. As they are used for entertainment, education, and talking with people faraway, they have had a negative effect on people. Let me explain. First of all, as people use computers in the beginning they enjoy it. They go on the @CAPS1, play games, and use it for work. But as they keep using it, they start to get addicted. People are addicted to computers because of the games and being able to go on the @CAPS1. In fact, @PERCENT1 of all the people in this @CAPS3 who owns a @CAPS8, is addicted to computers. That percentage is expected to grow to @PERCENT2 in the next @NUM1 years. Addiction to computers lead to serious issues. People have died because they spent too much time on the @CAPS8 without eating and sleeping. In another newspaper not long ago, it stated that a student attending @ORGANIZATION1, was dropped out for doing so poorly during school. His parent found out that he was addicted to this game ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4."" This game is right now the most played game on the @CAPS8 in this @CAPS3. Studies state that @CAPS8 addiction is almost as bad as smoking addiction. My second reason why @CAPS8 has a negative effect on people is because of online bullying. People chat on @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and email and people are bullied. A friend of mine recently was emailed with words that hurt his feeling. Online bullying is worse that inteacting bullying. That's because @CAPS9 you say something on the @CAPS8, people don't know who you are. @PERSON1, a proffesor who recently did studies of online bullying says, ""Online bullying has become more severe than contact to contact bullying. People are threatened more and hear more bad words than interacting."" The online bullying and harassment is going to get worse @CAPS9 people don't stop. Also people can get arrested for what they write online. My final reason why computers have a negative effect on people is that people spend too much time on computers and don't exercise @CAPS8 contribute about @PERCENT3 to overweight people. On the @CAPS8, everything is much easier. Instead of mailing, you could e-mail. You can listen to music instead of walking up to the radio and turning it on. You could buy tickets, shop, talk with friends, and have fun just by sitting on a @CAPS8. But this is why people become overweight and obese. @PERCENT4 of the people who use computers are obese or overweight. Peole spend less time interacting with friends and family and enjoying nature. In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people and parents should control their child's time on the computers. Just because of a @CAPS8, many issues rise. So @CAPS9 you think you are addicted, try to make a time schedule for your whole day. Use the @CAPS8 for an hour a time and take rests before using it again. Addiction, online bullying, and becoming overweight is not the only problems of a @CAPS8, there are many more.",9
92,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers tend to have more negative effects on people, rather than positive. This is true because people @MONTH1 not be getting enough exercise, people @MONTH1 not be enjoying nature to the forest, and lastly, because in this world, people do not spend enough time with family and friends. Computer are good to have around the house, but. To begin, people are spending too much time on computers. They are having more of a negative effect because while on the computer, you are not getting excercise. Think about the a day doing fat because of all the fast food on the computer while eating it. Obeseity now a days is a big concern with the @ORGANIZATION1. Staying on the computer does not help the situation. Any concerned person, technologically challenged would agree the countless ones on the computer are no good for the health of our country. Further more, people are spending too much time on computers and not enough beauty of nature. Many people, adults and have @DATE1 because they are world but there that should be explored and people should be thankful for beautiful that we have still @DATE1. They should be things wait to see it. Although communication is important for everyone, instead of talking on the computer, people should make plans with their family and friends. This idea also relates back to the lack of exercise and naivety of people. If people were to go out and enjoy life to the forest with their friends and family, there wouldn't be numerous hours a day wasted on a computer. People should get off their butts and go. Life is too short to sit around all day. Any intelligent person would realize that computer time isn't as fun as family and friend time. To conclude, computers are and have been very over-used recently. Instead of having problems, lack of sun, and just boring computer talk, people should got up and go. We only live once, and that once should be lived to the fulest!",9
93,"Dear editor, I think that computers are a good thing to have in the house. They're very helpful and entertaining. For example, they make @CAPS1 easier to keep in touch with far away friends and family, they help you learn things or know the important news, and their also very entertaining to people of all ages. This is why computers are one of the most valuable things to have in your home. One of the many things a computer can help you with is keeping in touch with family members of friends that live far away. Computers can serve that purpose because someone can use facebook, twitter, or skype when using one. ""I love facebook, because I can keep in touch with my family members in the @LOCATION1,"" says @PERSON2. Also, researchers say that people who have facebook, skype, or twitter accounts become closer to their families than people who don't. A computer can be used for educational purposes also. Many people like to use educational computer games to prepare their elementary - schoolers for school. ""@CAPS1's fun and gets my son prepared!"" says a local mother as she talks about a computer game. Studies show that computer games are @PERCENT1 better at preparing a child for school than textbooks and worksheets. One of everyone's favorite reasons for keeping a computer in the house is for entertainment. When on a computer, anyone can play cards, chess, pinball or game websites like addictinggames.com, go on youtube.com to watch videos, or much much more. ""I like to spend some of my free time on addictinggames.com,"" says @PERSON1. Also, after taking a poll. I found out that @PERCENT2 of kids and teens prefer online games to board games. As you can see, there are many reasons why having a computer in the house is important. There are also many more than what I listed. However, I think the main ones are to keep in touch with friends and family, to use the computer for educational purposes, and for entertainment. I'm very grateful for the computer in my house because I use @CAPS1 everyday for those purposes, and so does everyone else in my family. A computer is one of the most important things in the average home.",8
94,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am aware that many people are stateing that people spend too much time on computers and not getting enuff exercise well I have that their are a lot of people useing computers and they are gettiing enuff use. Im going to explane why within the most few paragraphs. First I would like to start off by saying its good that people are into computers and working with them because that books their learning activities and they learn new thinngs and it will help them be sucessfull in life, people play games, cross word puzzles, riddles, and many more. Same use the internet for ingredence, car parts, ect. Next, useing computers is very helpful to the human race because it will effect students school, parents/guardians/teens. It will effect and lots of schools are useing computers now and exspecialy students to do their. It effects parents, beca use it will sucess them in life and help them find jobs, with their jobs. Finally their getting enuff exercise because their going to bed, their eating, they go to school, work, or do something for the day that involves walking. Nobody just sits home and does nothing those days. Theirs always something to do or a place to go. Well I hope you think about what I told you and take it into consideration. Thank you for your time, and just remember your job is done on computer too.",8
95,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 in the @NUM1 grade in @CAPS5 @CAPS6 In @LOCATION1. I'm writing to you because I heard that more and more people use computer, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. In @CAPS1 opinion I think it benfit society. If you keep reading I will fell why it benif society. @CAPS1 first reason that computer have a positive effect on people. For example, when I see @CAPS1 older brother go on the computer he look much smarter on it. That @NUM2 out of @NUM3 member of @CAPS1 family learn thing from the computer. @CAPS1 second reason that it teach hand eye coordination. For example, when I play games in the computer @CAPS1 hand are the ones doing every thing for me. (@PERSON1 example is that we I wacth the game @CAPS1 hand are roating) @CAPS7 @NUM4 of @NUM3 of human play games in the computer and let their hand do everything. @CAPS1 third reason that it give people the ability to learn. For example, when I was using the computer use too teach so much that I'm go on most of the time. @NUM6 of @NUM3 student study in computers and they learn about thing that they never knew. Also they have the ability learn more on the computer. Some one might say people are spending too much time on their computer. However, I said that computer help people learn about thing that happen in the word. For example, they could larn about the war that going on and how people are risking their life for this cause. In conclusion, In @CAPS1 opinion it benefit society. Computer have a positive effet, I theach hand eye, and it give people the ability to learn. I think you should put all you support in the problem.",8
96,"Alot of people would disagree that computers are benefiting people. But I think that computers are exremely helpful because they are a good way to learn, they are fun to use, and it's also a goodway to talk to old friends. I know there are some people who are on computers alot more than they should but still computers are very helpful. Computers are a very good way to learn because on a computer you could easily find out whi the @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1 is. But if you didn't use a computer and you went to a library it could take hours to find the right and find were in the book it is. You could also learn about news faster without writing for it to come on the news channel. Computers are a lot beter than having to drive to a library because with just a couple as clicks you could find what you want and be done. Computers are also fun because you can play little games on the internet that could easily take up on extra @NUM1 minutes that yu might have on a work break or before school. And even some games exercise your mind like solitare its fun but hard. But there are some games that people tend to over do because they go addicted. But most people haven't ever prayed a game like that or only play once in a while. Lastly computers are a good way to stay in touch with old friends because there are a lot of ways to talk to people online like say if when you were in high school your best friends moved away you sould still talk to people on a chat room were you can text. or a video chat were you actualy see them face to face. In conclusion I think computers are helpful because you can learn, play and talk to people. Computers are best all around helpful.",8
97,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers have good effects on people such as letting people talkto family or friends that live faraway. Computers also let you learn about different places and people around the world. My first reason is that computers let you learn about different places and people around the world. This helps you if you are going on vacation to foreign country you can learn where the test historical sights are and you can also learn where the best hotels are. If you have a project due on a foreign country you can search it up and it will give you all the data you need about it. My second reason is that computers let you talk to family or friends that live faraway. This helps you keep in touch so it doesn't seem like you don't know them any more. Computers can also let you talk to your friends that live faraway and if you want to hangout it would let you talk about which days are good for you and them.",6
98,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers are bad because you will be wonign to do no homework because people are playing to much computers and they are getting aditivf to the computers and it is dayise because you mit be talking to people that you don't now on thr computer and it is the vary dagis because it is the sam thing as haveing a myspace on teh computer it is vaery dangish because ther are dad people that be going on the computer and people be pating bad stuf on the computer.",4
99,Computers don’t have any affect on kids we just love going on cause we use it for help and this persuade the readers of the local newspaper cause we need to be able to communicate also do writing essays and doing social studies or science homework my ideas are let us go computers cause were not bothering u can just leave us alone and let us do what you need to do cause what computers are what give us information for we have to do and were to do wat we gotta do and u people can just leave us alone cause arent addicting to me or anyone and if we were it still would it matter cause a computers a computer u dont punish it because just punish us from the computer punish us because of it cause its the computer fault it can be addicting cause the computer is device that gives us wat we need and the information we also the computer does favors for us the computer is a amazing thing,5
100,I think that using computer is fine. Reason why I think you have family from far away. Instead of talking hearing voice on the phone. They can talk to each other but most of all see each other. Show cool thing you have that are new. When you have a love one you can see them when there a way for a trip. Computer are helpful when your car is broken down or when you have no car. You can buy stuff at store by the comfort of your home. Almost everything you can get stuff out of store because they have online store to mail to you. Also now you can buy food on internet and lots more. Saving money computer tell you where to get good prices to save money. Lots of dating sites to meet diffent people to go out and give your commets. Texting on facebook can let you save money by texting for free. Playing free online games with your friends. You can make website and you can watch movie and show online. There just a lot of thing you can do on a computer. I know lots of people don't go outside exercise but I agree with some expert. Lot of people need to lose weight or need to go outside more to the real world. This techology people are big they don't go out more. They eat lots of food. But computer are very helpful in lots of way and its so fun. Those are my reason why I think that computer are great and sould be used more.,7
101,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 home computers is a good thing for many reasons. One reason is because people can use computers to learn about other countries and people. People can also use computers to type and save paper. Also, people can use computers to talk to people living close or far away from you. Finally, computers can save paper by replacing books. One @MONEY1 the most important reasons why people need computers is because computers can help you learn about and research other things going on in the world. If a student needs to research a country and write a paper about it for school, it is much easier and faster to use a computer than to look through a textbook.Computers are also better and faster than a textbook if you want to know more about a person or a culture. Using computers to type are also faster than writing a paper. Using a computer can save time and money when it comes to typing a paper. When you are typing a paper, you don't have to worry about @CAPS1 handwriting or breaking your pencil. You also don't have to worry abut spelling something wrong because computers can check you spelling and grammar. What you are writting a paper you have in about all @MONEY1 these problems and more. You also have to spend money on pencils and other writting suppplies. Computers also saved people @MONEY1 becase they didn't need to buy paper to make textbooks. Computers also evolved how people can communicate with each other. Before computers were invented, you couldn't talk to people in other countries unless you paid to use a phone or sent them mail. Now, you can send instant mail which saves days @MONEY1 time and paper. You can also use webcams to talk to family members and people you don't know. That can save you a lot @MONEY1 money because you don't have to pay money for postage stamps, phone calls, or plane rides to visit them. Those are some @MONEY1 the best reasons why @CAPS1 a home computer is better than not @CAPS1 one. A home computer can save you time when you want to research a country, person, or culture. They can save you money because you don't have to buy postage stamps, pay for phone calls, or pay for plane rides to visit someone from a different state or country. Computers also help save paper because you no longer need to make large textbooks or use a different price @MONEY1 paper when you make a writting mistake.",9
102,"Dear, Local Newspaper, In my opinion computers are everything, They provide with so many things for you to do like chess, listening to music, and even downloading you favorite movies. First of all, computers are a great source of communication because if you have a long distance relative that lives in @LOCATION1 then you can talk to them online. You can do this through via email. Instant message, and @CAPS1. Secondly, Computers let you search the web. So if you need to findout some directions to your destination or want to get informaion on some far awat places like @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4, or my favorite @CAPS2 @CAPS3 you can because the web lets you do that. Thirdly, they are a great source of entertainment. Well because you can watch episodes of your favorite @CAPS4.V. show or you can watch music videos. Also you @MONTH1 enjoy listening to music from your computer as you personal entertainment. I think that computers are great. I use them myself as an example I love to download music into my ipod from my computer. Then I get to enjoy the music from my ipod. Last, but not least, @CAPS5 computers have a great effect on a majority of people. I believe that if we didn'@CAPS4 have computers then our world wouldn'@CAPS4 be the same. So I say keep computers here to stay. They complete us all.",7
103,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION2. A computer is a very helpful resource. It helps people navagate through life, they can find jobs, do research for school. This world wold be nothing without computers. But on the other hand some people do spend to much time on the computer. But surfing the web for countless hours is their choice. Computers can help students do research from the comfort of their own home. Instead of going to the local library and looking and looking for books, all they have to do is type in thier research topic and wallah tons of different websites are right under their noses. A computer is the world at your finger tips. Also a computer can help unemployed people find a job. Its easy, type in what city you want to work in, and there you go. You can even fill out a job application right then and there. Hey, some people even work from home. Stay at home moms can easily make money while doing daily chores like washing dishes. Also working from home can a lot less tessful. It's less stressful because you dont have to deal with annoying and impatiant co. workers. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of employment is from the workers home, @CAPS1 now you know. Working from home makes another day at the office, another day at home. Computers have helped us come along way since caveman times. Without computers this would will be nothing. We woulde have so many basic things like stoplights, elevators, and even bleders. We also wouldn't have the more sifisticated things like fockets. and cars and planes. Imagine an airport without computers, where would they store all of their information? On paper? Where would a school store all their grades and tardys? On paper? Where would the goverment store their information? On paper? With those three palces we already cut down half of the @ORGANIZATION1. Computer help the environment too. They will also help us to invent more technology so that one day we can live on @CAPS2 or something. I hope this essay changed your mind about computers. Lets recap they help students reasearch, help people find jobs, you can work from home. Helps the environment. Without computers we would live in caves and walk around with leaves for underwear like caveman. The @CAPS3 line is that computers are very helpful.",9
104,"Dear @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 The purpose of this letter is about how computers have changed our lives for the better. They have improved our society. Changed our way of life and have made things easier. I am a firm beliver that computer were one of the greatest invention of all time. Computers have had a very vital and positive impact on society. For example, education has vastly expanded since the computer. Both teachers and students have benefited. Students can now search the intrenet and learn about different places, things in history, how to read and write bette, etc. Also computers have been a major part in entertainment. From reading online news to watching movies and listening to music computers entertain all of us. And computers help us connect with friends and even meet new people. Aside from that computers make life easier. People can get degrees from learning online learn another. Research as also easier than is to computers you can just about anything than to computers. Some people say computers stop people acting with family but infact facebook you can still. Computer have also ourlives. From helping small buiness thrive by making it easier to make and recieve orders to help spread information globaly computers make this all possible. As I have shown computers have benefited society and have had a positive effect on human beings from educating individuals to staying in touch with relitives, computers have made their mark on improving the way we live. I hope this letter will help show you that computers are a necesary part of the twenty first century.",8
105,"Dear local newspaper, Computers are fairly new, everone has one everone wants one! There are so many great things they can be used for. But are they getting used to much? As a student and a teenager I know I am using mine way more than I need to. Sure they are fun, and sure their very usefull but they are time consuming. You @MONTH1 be doing work or chatting with a friend, but your also just sitting their. Being on the computer taks away from lots of exercising or doing other activits. I am deffintly not saying to stop using your computer totally, becasue they are agreat inveshion. But why sit on a computer chatting to a friend that lives right down the street, when you could be outside, playing a game of kickball or something fun. It would be a good idea just to chat on line with the friends or family thay live far from you like in other states. Another time that I would say to use your computer is when doing some work, projects or homework. Or even if your job involves doing research. Computers are a great tool to use. But most people aboose that privilage and go one other websites that have nothing to do with there reserech. So if you need a computer for school or work stay on task! That way you get what you need done. If you are a student or have a job which is the comon day person it's hard not to use the computer. There are so many helpful things to use it for. But that doesn't mean you need to be on it all day and night. Take about @NUM1 minutes to an hour of your day talk to those people you never get to see, do your reach. Then get up and enjoy nature. You don't need more then an hour. I stronly agree with the experts people are spending way to much time on there cumputers. Use it to befit you, and to help you not to kemp you from getting bord. Don't abuse the fact you have enter-net if you need resherech get that done stay on task. Rember an hour a day is more than enough! So get off your computers go out side and stay fit!",8
106,"Dear Local Newspaper, I agree that computers have a positive effect on people. You learn hand - eye coordination, you don't have to step out to go to the library and it can improve social skills. Continue reading to find out why. Computers, we use them everyday. They are teaching us something. We @MONTH1 not even realize it, but they are teaching us hand-eye coordination. We type something and we use our eyes to look at the screen and then our hands to type, one mistake and automatically our hand fix it. Or maybe when we are playing games online, the same thing applies. Our eyes are looking, while our hands are fast at work over the keyboard. Hand-eye Coordination is a skill you need on sports, and I believe that computers, since we spend time on them are the quick way to learn that skill. Next, how many student's parents work? My parents do. Something it becomes difficult to walk to the library, not everyone lives in walking distance to one. That's when a computer helps. If you have a project to do, but your parents work, you can just @ORGANIZATION1 it up, you might even get more information, then what you can get in the library. Hows that? you ask. Well, for an example, @CAPS1 you had to do a project on @CAPS2. Let's just say, you managed to go to a library, but apparently there were only @NUM1 books on @CAPS2, out of which @NUM2 were checked out. You can always check it out from another library, but that might not come soon enough, on a survey @PERCENT1 of students said this has happened to them, but the computer saved them. So what else did they say? HELLO @ORGANIZATION1! Last but not least, a computer improves your social skils. When I first moved here I was a very shy person. When I made a @CAPS3, I @CAPS4 talking to people who go to my school. I even became friends with them. I'm not saying that you should just stop talking to people in person, and use @CAPS3, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, or @CAPS8 and communicate. @CAPS9 I am saying is that if you start talking to them online, you know them a little, then when you talk in person you will see you have alot in common, with that person, and soon you can become friends. Another thing, that is somewhat related to this. I have many friends living in @LOCATION1, and many cousins in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, @CAPS9 over. We @CAPS9 know, you can't travel @CAPS9 the time, sometimes you can't even get to see them. Thats @CAPS10 social networks help. You can keep in touch, plus @CAPS11.S. not even waste minutes on you phone. Can it get better? In conclusion, Computers have a very positive effect on people. From improving hand-eye coordination, to not stepping out to go to the library, and getting that project done in time with a A+ as a grade, to improving your socia skills. Even see the data collected. Thank you for taking your time and effort to read this, I hope it has persuaded many people.",10
107,"Dear @PERSON1, I am on the side of computers. You @MONTH1 think I'm only saying that because I'm @NUM1 years old and it is basically what I do for fun. Computers do benefit society because they are fun, a source of communication, good for schooling and education, and for work. Computers are not just the @CAPS1 but also @CAPS6 procesor and @ORGANIZATION1 and everything like that. Computers provide games for everyone from ages @NUM2 to @NUM3. When it is raining outside your parents are at work and you are by yourself and have nothing to do, turn on the computer. Play a game. There are many fun websites made for everyone. Computers also provide an exellent source of communication. There are all different kinds of @CAPS2-mail. @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION4, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and many other sites are exellent for talking to friends. Not everyone has a cell phone so when you talk to them via @CAPS5 or any of the others it is nice to chat. Computers provide an exellent source of education. If you are doing a history project and you need more information and pictures, log onto a computer and @ORGANIZATION3 it. At our school we have edline which tells us all of our homework assignments. It is extremly handy. Now they also have schooling tutors online. It is great. Computers are great for work. @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION5, and other @ORGANIZATION2 wear or other compnies. You can find your information and make something out of it. It is very, very useful for buisness workers. As you can see, computers have a lot of great uses. I think computers effect people in a positive way by helping them in positive ways. Computers allow fun, communication, educational purposes, and work uses. Computers are a good thing to have around, @CAPS7't you think?",8
108,"I think spending a lot of time on the computer is not a good idea because @CAPS1 has bad things online. @CAPS1 makes people stupid, and @CAPS1 makes you lazy. Those are the @NUM1 reasons why you shouldn't stay on the computer all day. One of the reasons is that the computer has bad things online like kidnaps. I seen a lot of video and movies about kidnaps when an older men or women starts taking to some young kids and they go meet some place and the young teen or kid never comes back. Another reason is that the computer makes you stupid for example when I use to be on the computer all day I would get out to get something to eat and some times I would go in the bathroom to get food and then I notice that thats not the kochen @CAPS1 feels like I just woke up when I got off. My last reson is that computer makes you lazy. The computer makes you lazy because you just stay in the computer all the time sitting on the chair without sun light or exercise @CAPS1 will make you want to stay here more and its not good for you mind and body. These are my three reasons why you should not stay on the computer, the more you the more you will want to stay. So don't stay on the computer because there is bad things in there, @CAPS1 will make you lazy. Please don't stay on the computer for a long time.",7
109,"Dear local newspaper, have computers ever hurt anyone? I believe the effects of computers on people are positive ones. For one, computers let people talk and socialize, even if they are on different sides of the planet. Another effect they have is letting people work faster in businesses and other jobs that require mathmatics. Lastly, computers allow people to see far away places and learn about almost anything with a click of a button. Because of the internet, people across the globe can talk to each other as if they were neighbors. Lets say a friend or family had to move to another country or state. They could be apart for months or even years. They would miss each other contantly. But with computers, they can talk to each other like they were still neighbors. Computers also have some more ""practical"" uses. They make it easier to see their stocks, their income, and even see sale trends. Lets say you needed to make a change to the price of your goods but your car broke down and the incorrect price was miles away. You would halfway have to wait for a mechanic or run for miles to get to a phone. But with a computer, you wouldn't need to do any of that. Just log on and change the price from the luxury of your own home. There are also educational purposes for computers. Computers let you travel the world without taking a step. You could take a trip through the safari or go on an adventure in the raln forest. You could take in the beauty of the great plains or watch the ever changing sands of the sahara desert. You could learn about the greeks, archemedes, ancien egypt, or pacman, with a computer, the world is your oyster. That is why I see computers as a positively amazing thing. Because they let us do things our minds usually can't because they allow people to traverse the world in seconds, and because they allow people oceans away to talk together. So think, are computers really harmful?",9
110,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 life without computers. There would be no quick access to information, no way to socialize, and no way to keep your health records or other personal information safe. Without this technology where would we be? I believe that the world is benefiting from the advances in technology today. As a student, computers are a crucial element to allow me to get my work done. without the guidance from @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7, @CAPS4 @CAPS5, or other applications, @CAPS6 woudn't be possible for me to reach my full potential a assignments. How could a student be so certain their grammar is perfect on their homework without asking a teacher? There is a way. It is called @ORGANIZATION2 tools. However, the only way to access this is through a computer or @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7 @ORGANIZATION2 tools allows you to check your spelling, grammar, and punctuation with just a click of your mouse. Computers are an essential learning tool for school system today. Not only are computers used to educate, but they are helpful in the real world. Many business rely on the work of Computers entirely. In facts, @CAPS8 to @PERSON1 @CAPS9 @ORGANIZATION1, a local business ""@LOCATION1,"" In our job, we continuously we work with. this wouldn't be possible without the effort of our typist on the computer.

We should continue to progress in this groth @PERCENT1 of business in @LOCATION1 say they would have to close dawn @CAPS6 not for computers with so many business doing this, our economy would drop. This would not help. We all know computers and other technology are great sources of entertainments. What you @MONTH1 not now, however, is that they supply a great amount of knowledge to the average person. For example, lets say you finished watching a special on the discovery channel about @LOCATION2. You want to know more, so you pull out your iPod touch.

People @MONTH1 not believe so, but it is true that you canlearn a great deal of information from various forms of technology. You can have all the resources you'll ever reed right at your fingertips. Computer supply so much more then just entertainment. All reasonable people would agree advances in technology are extremely helpul to the public. there is so much guidance for our daily lines through computers.",12

112,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 computers benefit our society has been a hotly debated topic among citizens in our town. Many argue that computers provide quick easy communication, help children and adults learn, and even teach balancing habits to our generation. I firmly believe that computers are necessary in our society. @CAPS2, @CAPS3! I miss you!"" are the words @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1-year-old @PERSON1. @PERSON1 has been working overseas for two years in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3. One @ORGANIZATION1 the only ways she can contact her father is through @ORGANIZATION3. Communication is extremely important in our society; it brings families and friends closer together. Computers provide a variety @ORGANIZATION1 forms @ORGANIZATION1 communication, such as @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS5, and instant messaging. ""@ORGANIZATION3"" allows people to have what can be called a ""visual phone conversation."" A teary-eyed @PERSON2 says, ""@CAPS4 since @CAPS7 wife died, @CAPS7 daughter has been @CAPS7 only companion. With @ORGANIZATION3, I can not only hear her voice every day but see her face, too. It never fails to make me smile."" @CAPS5 and instant messaging also give out society fast, easy communication with others. Invitations, announcements, and just a quick ""hello"" can all be done by @CAPS5. Therefore, computers are very important for communication in our society. Have you @CAPS4 seen the look on a child's face @CAPS10 he/she learns something new? Computers provide an excellent variety @ORGANIZATION1 education in our society. For example, toddlers and children can use programs such as @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS6). @CAPS6 programs teach reading, writing, and speaking to children. ""@CAPS7 child used @CAPS6 @CAPS10 he was a toddler,"" says @PERSON3, a @LOCATION1 resident, ""and now his teachers are so impressed by his reading and writing skills. I couldn't be more proud."" Computers don't only teach children; they teach adults, too! Did you know that adults learn @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 their knowledge about the environment, politics, and other basic information from the computer? Computers are needed to help people learn in our society. Finally, computers teach balance. A @LOCATION1 mom says, ""@CAPS7 teenager @PERSON4 has learned how to balance computer and life, and I can definitely see how it connects to other areas @ORGANIZATION1 balance as well."" @CAPS10 teenagers learn to balance their computer time, they also learn how to balance, extra-curricular activities in school. This shows, as a result, that students actually learn responsibility from computers. I hope that our society will consider the fact that computers are necessary. @CAPS10 they provide commonication, teach education, and help kids learn how to balance, what do we have to lose? Computers can most certainly improve our society.""",12
113,"Dear @CAPS1 post, Computers have been here for a while now and taking them away would be like forgetting all the progress we made in technology. Computers are everywhere in fact, seven out of ten families on my street own atleast one computer in their household. So why would we want to take them away? Computers are too useful. Computers are not only fun, but very resourceful. Anybody with a question faild easily hop on a computer, research it on google.com and find what they were looking for within minutes. I remember when I had a cut on my arm that looked weird, my mom was to heal a wound. She researched it and got how to the mark go away. The computer only benefits you in a way. Is most likely them youll be staying at in two weeks and realize they don't have a pool! Lastey, without computers we would have no communication with new or different people. Computers are great for communicating. People are able to comunicate through twitter, @CAPS2, and even youtube. The sites all help people make new friends online almost like pen pals on the internet. Also, if the majority of your family lived in @LOCATION1 and you were stuck in @CAPS3, you could easily talk to them through email or an instant messanger. Hopefully now you have a better understanding of how much of a lifesaver the computer is. Maybe you could even make next @STATE1 about how resourceful, beneficial and social computers are!",8
114,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, Computers are beneficial to society. They promote learning, coordination, and even general welfare. It is true that computers @MONTH1 be detrimental to a person's health, affecting the amount of exercise and interaction a person gets, but the positive effects of computers more than make up for this. People learn much of what they know from the computer. Among an infinite number of things a person can learn from them are definitions new words, scientific theories, algebraic equations, history, law, any number of languages, and much more. Computers, when used for learning, can teach people things they @MONTH1 learn in school, but on their own time, computers exercise the brain, and teach it to think beyond the bounddries of ""@NUM1."" They also teach the brain how to better direct the body to face i'ts needs. Coordination can be very hand for some people, and this can be a problem. Without coordination, people wouldn't be able to catch a ball, avoid certain dangers, or even stand. To help improve this people need practice. They can get this practice from exercise catching ball, threading a needle, or using a computer. Using the mouse on a computer can help with hand-eye coordination in that it forces the brain to direct the mouse to a certain place on the screen, in order to accomplish what is needed to be done. At first, this process @MONTH1 be excrutiatingly slow, but over time, as the brain gets practice at this coordination improves and the process speeds up @CAPS1, the person will be able to use the computer faster and more efficiently. This will help them play games, learn, or even help people when they are in need. Helping people is very important in this day an age. That's why it is important for people to find out news quickly so that they can help. Computers allow this. For example, on the day of the deadly earthquake in @LOCATION1, most of the world found out within the hour from computers. News sites broadcast its social networking sites such as @CAPS2 talked about it, and people talked to each other online about it. This rapid spread of the news saved many lives in @LOCATION1 as people immediately dropped what they were doing and rushed to help. Computers affect people in that they help to send out news and stories causing them to want to help people. Many websites also are adept at donating money while playing a game. For example, www.freenke.org is a site that donates @NUM2 grains of rice for every question answered correctly, and they have donated over @NUM3 @CAPS3 grains of rice. Obviously, computers and sites like these have to have a positive effect on the world. Overall, one would think that computers have a mostly positive effect on the world. Despite limiting exercise, they encourage learning, and the exercise of the brain. Computers also help people with their coordination, which is very important. Finally, computers promote a world where people want to help each other, and a world where people keep up with current events, whether they like it or not. Thank you, editor, for considering my side on the positive effects computers have on the world.",9
115,"Computers have little to no effect on people. In fact computers help us out a lot. They help us in find @CAPS1, medical, research and to tell weather or not you have cancer. The computers that people think of are machines that sit in a room and is used often but not for its purpose. People use it sometimes for entertainment not research. There aren't just those kind of computers. There are bigger more advanced computers that scientist use every day. @CAPS2 computers do have an effect on us, but in a good way. Most of the time those people playing games or music are kids who are bopard. They use it a little too often. I anly play with it on rainy days when I can't go outside and play. Humans use computers mainly because it makes life simpler, easier. @CAPS2, it does make life simpler, like for example instead of handwriting a report, you can type it or intead of searching everywhere in a book, you can go straight to the information. One last example is; when you want to stay updated on your favorite sport team, you don't have to go to their game you just have to go to their web site. In my opinion I say that @CAPS2, computers do have and effect on us but a good reason. I'm a sports fan so I play a lot of sports. I use the computer offer for fun and research. It dosen't have an effect on me. It dosen't effect at all because I still exercise a play with my friends very often, like everyday. There is no reason to why people can't use computers quite often. Computers don't have a positive effect sometime, but it doesn't have a negitive effect sometime either. I exercise, enjoy nature and interact with friends and family too. I also use the computer often. Experts shouldn't be concerned with people using computers too much.",8
116,"Deear Newspaper, I think that the effects that computers are having on people is a @CAPS1 thing because most people just sit at the computers all day long. In this letter I am going to talk about the effects of computers on people, what we could be doing instead, and what person are doing on the computer. First thing is that computers are having a @CAPS1 effect on people and there life computers are making people just fit inside on their computers all day and do nothing. They just sit there playing games also about @PERCENT1 of the people who are spending to much time on the computer are probally pating well their on the computer which that is why some people @MONTH1 be fat. Most of the people who spend all of they time on the computer is people in there @NUM1's and @NUM2's some are in there @NUM3's or @NUM4's. Just sitting there on the computer will get you. Where in life. It will not give you a job or school education. By just sitting at the computer for a while you will not be able to do things out side. If so many people were not on the computer all the time then they could be outside. Being outside they can play sports, ride bikes, swim, run and more. They could also get a job and make some money or go to college, kids who are on the computer to much could get out and go to the mall, hang with friends you could get some exercise, or just enjoy nature. There is no use for going on the computer and being there for more then @NUM5 or @NUM6 hours, the most you should be on the computer would be an hour to an hour and a half. Kids and teenagers should only go on the computer for homework and the rest of the time doing something eles. Well all of the kids grade through @NUM7 grade should go out a play with their toys and people @NUM8 grade and up should hang out with and do thing like go to the mall, see a movie, or just have a sleepover. Also everyone in these grades should interact with there families more by seeing them more then @NUM7/@NUM8 times a month and they could have parties or just get together and hang out. So people should do some of the other things I said instead of just going on the computer all of the time. The last thing is the things that people are doing on the computers which is like I sometimes go on facebook. Other people go on facebook, google, games looking up information, and more. They also have emails where they chat with other people. Another thing people go on is youtube and listen to music and watch veidos. So I don't think that the effect of the computers on people is a good thing. I think that people shoud be out doing things then just sitting at home on the computer. People who sit at home on computers could and probally will get to fat. So the effect of computers on people is @CAPS1.",8
117,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 in the society we live in, more and more people are using computer including me. The computor in my opinion has to be one of the best inventions ever. The bad part is that these ""exports"" think spending time on the computer is a bad idea when they fail to see the good in computers. Student can use computers to get information on almost about anything, you could use computer to talk to friend and family members, and you confuse it as a navigator to find directions to a certain location if you cant find your way or if your lost. One of the best things about computers is that you can find various amounts of information. That opition is useful for children that attend school , looking to find information for a certain project they need to finish. You can also use the information on the computer to study if your textbook isnt doing you only good. Also if a student is looking for a job in their local area they look on the internet for jobs needing employees. Computers also can be used for communication. You could have a long lost realtive you havent spoken to in a while, you can easily find him on the internet. Online communicating is also good for chatting with schoolmates if you forgot the homework or need help with homework. Im not a big fan of this but online chatting can be use for online dating if your to lazy to go out. One of my favorite options on the computer is that you can use it to navigate a certain location you want to go to. Lets just say you forgot where a relatives house is you can easily type in your address and his address and easily get directions. You can use this method for almost anywhere you want to go. If this did not convince you that that a computer is a great piece of technology, then your crazy. The computers is like a magical box that can be used for anything so I advice you get one.",8
118,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 your computer daily can be a waste of your life. Your computer time can take away from your time spent exercsing and enjoying nature, distract you from human nature things such as communicating, and can also waste tons of energy. Picture yourself, sitting at your desk, talking to some friends online. Take away your computer and all youre doing is sitting thhere, not burning one calorie, or exercising one muscle, [expect your fingers of ] @CAPS2't you think you should be doing something more usefull in your life?

Communication wih only your friends can cause you to miss out on things. For example, lets say there is a cancelation at your work place on the news, but you @CAPS2't see it cause you were @CAPS6-ing with your friend. @CAPS6? @PERCENT2 of people @CAPS2't even ""laugh out loud"" @CAPS7 they send that to their friends.

Therefore, my point is made.",10
119,"Today more than @PERCENT1 of our population spends expensive amounts of time each day on the computer. I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the ""great deals"" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a ""great deal?"" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals. Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe. Instead they should spend time outdoors, with family: or enjoying life!",10
120,"Dear Newspaper, In our town, more people are on the computer each day. Some people state that you can do a lot on the computer and talk to people. But, I believe that our town should not support advances in technology. You will have more time to exercise, talk to family and friends in person and to take part in different activities around the town. Do you want to be overweight and not be in shape? Well, if you sit at the computer all day every day, you will become like that. ""I think exercise shoud be a part of everybody's day,"" @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 stated. You would be so attatched to your computer, that you wouldn't work out.

Some kids in school are on the internet all day talking to friends who live down the street. Students refuse to talk to their friend on the phone. Instead, they do it online. ""@CAPS4 can understand their tone of the message sent,"" @PERSON3 stated. You could interpret it in different ways. When you are on the phone, it is a quick and easy way to communicate not waiting for somebody to type back. If you are a person who is always on the computer, plan a get together with your friend to talk in real life. Sidewalk sales, clubs, sports teams, holiday stroll, these are events that every town offers! Instead of sitting dreaming of being on the team, go out and do it! Each town cares about its residents and want them to have fun. That is why towns offer these activities. ""@CAPS5 want to make the town interasting and everybody to know each other,"" says @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @PERSON2. If you participate in these activities, you will meet other kids your age around the town. If your town offers all of these activities, they are helping you out. Being out helping the town is way better than sitting in your house on the computer! In many ways both advancing technology or not, why be inside doing nothing but talking to people? Go and talk to them in real life. Being in shape, talking to people in real life and activities your town offers is the way to go. Thank you for your concern",9

We live in a generation where computers have become a necessity instead @ORGANIZATION1 pleasure. According to @PERSON1, a psychologist at the @ORGANIZATION1, more than @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people, now-a-days, are inside on their computers. Furthermore, computers are making people lazier. Instead @ORGANIZATION1 going to the store to buy things or walking to your friends house to talk, you would typically use the computer to do so. Therefore, people don't spend enough time doing other things. For example, on a sunny and beautiful day you would think that most kids would be outside having fun, but this isn't thet case anymore. For children who are old enough to use / work a computer, they'@CAPS1 be inside on that nice day. There are many nice things to do on a computer, like chatting with friends, checking your e-mails, and facebook. Even though these things are pleasurable, you should limit your time on the computer. Most @ORGANIZATION1 the time that you spend on the computer could be spent outside or at the movies. Not being on the computer could help small buisnesses too. If you pay money to do an activity, or buy something, watch something it would make a difference in the small buisness's profits. On the other hand, computers don't benefit your health. Mac. magazine says that there are health risks when you use your computer all the time. @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people become obese and have vitamind @CAPS1 deficiancy from using their computers so much. When using your computer you could be working out or exercising, and this causes obesity. Also, if you are inside all the time, you wont get the healthy amount @ORGANIZATION1 sunlight that you need, thus you have a vitamin @CAPS1 deficiancy. Another health risk is having bad eyes. If you spend hours a day on a computer your eyes can get permanently damaged. Do you want your child / children to be put at risk for using a computer too much? In conclusion, it is safe to say, that computers do not benefit society today. Many people have an addiction to technology, you could be using your time more wisely, and computers put your health at risk. Although computers do allow us to have an easier time accomplishing tasks, abusing the privlage will have consiquenses on everyone.",9
122,"Dear local newspaper @CAPS1 I think that kid's should be alowed to go on here computers. So they can talk to there relitives across. The @CAPS5 @CAPS2 they want to. I have family members in @LOCATION1. I talk to them evry day because I have a laptop and they say that. I have relitives in @LOCATION3 I belive them because I have there email. They told me about my mother living in @LOCATION2. So I asked her she seaid yes that is true and I looked up were my mom lived. Thanks to computer also I learned that @LOCATION3 has one of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 in The @CAPS5. So I asked my mom @CAPS2 I can go to @LOCATION3 she said yes. So I went with my sister and we even visited are family members and the @CAPS6 point I can tell you it looked exacly how. I pichered very tall coverd with trees. Birds @CAPS7, scwerwels climing trees the thing, that surprised me the most was there was a house on top of the mountine. For sale I wished that my mom was thier because she will love it. So ever time we go down there we rent that house thanks to the computers. Lastly you can even look up people on the internet. I herd that criss rock almost died. So when I got home I went on my laptop and looked it up so I did and it said nothing about. That but it did say one thing that surprised me. The most it seaid that he was geting a divorce. From his wife I think the peorson how said. That he almost died most of missed read it. So now I look up all my fraverit people. Thanks to computers the time is now to accet @CAPS2 people should have computers to use to lern about the @CAPS5 or just think what everyone sayes. So I hope you make a good chouse. But befor you choose think about it.",8
123,"Computers can take a lot of a person's time, but there are also benefits to having one. You could gain loads of knowledge and make interaction with others easier with a click of the cursor. The computer is the smartest thing youll ever see. All the facts of life and the world are put into it. Think of all the knowledge you would have from reading articles you find on google.com and all the other search engines. Wondering what is the best way to get somewhere? You can also look at maps of the whole world and zoom all the way to birds eye view. There's your map with just a click of the cursor. Does your child have a question from school that even you can't answer? There are help sites that can show and explain how to do your homework. Or if your child doesn't know what the homework and their friends are busy and can't tell them, most schools have websites with information about everything in school. There's your child's grades with just a click of the cursor. Your late for a party and you don't have a cell phone, but your family has one computer and you know your friend will be on. You can just log on to your facebook, twitter, or myspace and tell them your running late. It's @DATE1, no one writes letters anymore; there's e-mail and instant messaging. Letters take forever to write and if you mess up you have to start over. When you type, all you do is hit ""backspace"" and you write over only your mistake. Letters also take forever to recieve, while instant messeges come, well, instantly! Haven't seen your cousin or just want to see them? Computers are being made with webcams, or you can simply buy a detached one. You could be talking with your friend and seeing them right on your computer just with a click of the cursor. Don't think that's enough? If you explored the computer, then you'd find it can help you with a lot more than just learning and interaction.",10
124,"in @DATE1 has become far more advanced. Computers are one of the most futiristic objects. The computer is good for connecting to people around the world. However, computers have bad effects on people's lives. Children are taking time out of their homework to go on the computer, citizens are gaining weight, and children are being kidnapped. School is very important and valuable if you want to suceed in life. However, computers have made it difficult for students to concentrat on their homework. This is a horrible habbit and a bad effect on students every where. Students grades will suffer and will not obtain class credits if this problem is not mentioned. Obesity is a huge problem in @LOCATION1, five out of every ten @CAPS1 are either overweight or obese. This can lead to death. The problem is that people are spending hours on the computer each day. Most of that time can be used to exercise. Exercising can be an important benefit to someone's life. If this problem is not addressed millions of americans will be overweight, @CAPS2 is a very serious and dangerous topic. Every month dozend of kids are kidnapped. Since the internet was invented there is a twenty percent increase rate of kids missing children will go on poppular networking websites such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and twitter and give out their important information. Pedophiles use the internet to trick children in to giving their address. This problem needs to stop and be addressed by the police. Everyday, more and more people use computers. Compuers have good and bad effects on peoples lives. The bad effects are very serious and dangerous. How would you feel if your child fails school, gains weight, or gets kidnapped because of the computer?",9
125,"Do you think people spend to much time on the computer do. I think that kids and adults spend to much time @CAPS1, twitering, doing facebook and myspace. My resons include, people should go outside more, and play with real people, and spend time with family. Most kids should go out side more for example my friend @PERSON3 spent @NUM1 hours a day! on his computer and haven went outside. Another example is my neghbor @PERSON2 spent all day! in his basement playing on his computer and haven went outside and since he hevet went outside he is terreibely the sun and he is now @NUM2 years old an dhe still dont go outside it was because he spent to much time on the computer. Secondly, people should play with real people. For example there was a kid name @CAPS2 and he allways played with vertual people an dfrends and never realy pleople and now he is so shy around real people that he wont even say one word. Another example is @CAPS3 he only had vertual frend and never a real one and he is so depress becose he never had a best frend. Thirdly you should spend time with your family. there was a named @CAPS4 and he never spent time with his family becse he was to busy writing emails and @PERSON1 says that kids who dont interact with them wont have the same benifits as kids who do. Another example there was a family who were to bisy with the computer that the kids never met the grandparents and when the grand parents passed away the kids never met them becse they would rather play on there computers. In conclution people should go outside more, play with real people, and visit there family then if you want to play on your computer then after reading all of these examples then go ahead.",8
126,"Do you think being able to look up information on anything or talk to people that are for away is ggod? With a computer these are some things that you will be able to do. Being able to talk to anyone that is far away is good. Some people have family in other countries that they have not seen in a long time and with a computer you can talk to them. @CAPS1 the people we have sent to @ORGANIZATION1 they have a Family here and I have heard of them using computers to talk to them because they miss them. Also if you live in an area that gets bad weather and you can not go anywhere a computer can help pass the time, @CAPS1 the people that live in the @CAPS2 they can get alot of snow during the winter time and @MONTH1 have to stay inside. So if they have a computer they are able to do things @CAPS1 play some games or can watch some videos to pass the time. Another thing a computer is good for is that you are able to search for anything. You are able to learn about faraway places even if you have never been there just by looking it up. Some kids do have some trouble with some homework but can use a computer to learn some more about it and hopefully they will now understand how the work is suppose to be done instead of going to the teacher tomorrow and telling them that you did not do it. There are my opinions why a computers have a positive effect on people. By being able to search anything, help children with homework, and pass the time if you have nothing to do.",8

128,"Dear editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, People say that technology is affecting everybody left and right. Computers actively help us with our daily lives. It helps us do project for school, let us understand culture around the world, and gives us the ability to talk and connect with friends and family everywhere. Our shool makes us do tons of project and the computer is our main course. If you want to go somewhere far away, you're most likely to research it, and then plan on going. It is also might be used to talk with friends on facebook, twitter, and @CAPS3. Computers help us learn and communicate. To start off, as an eight grades, we are prepared to go to high school. Fortunately, it means we do projects, reports, and research on the computer. The computer enables us to find information for a project, or construct a diagram or data table for a survey. Many people use this method for jobs. People do reports on celebrities and famous people from history. Books can't always give the information you are looking for, so they look up that persons name, and they will find our hundred of web sites that give information and photographs of that person. In addition to, computers let you book flights, buy, tax rates. Sometimes, people don't always to go and drive to a local car, so they go online to a website that sells, and they are able to look at all of the features of the car, the price, and mileage. The only way you can get tickets is if you go onto the internet. They have websites that let book whatever kind of flights you want. It can be to go to florida, or it can be a flight to @LOCATION1. If you also how the economy is doing, you can look up tax rates and how find out how much our country is in debt. You can even find out how much an average family pays - every year. Computers can be very they resourceful at @CAPS2. It gives capability to do more than you can imagine. Most importantly, computers have created a way for you talk to friends and family around the globe. Facebook and twitter are the new things of the century. Facebook and twitter let you talk to friends, post photos and talk about your personal life. They have a new thing now where you can play lifestyle games. @CAPS3 is not as popular anymore and doesn't have as many cool things. It only let's you talk to friends and that's why no one uses it anymore. People want to be able to do more than just talk. It comes to my attention that computers have over time. Computers these days enable you to talk with friends, do research and projects, and let you book flights and buy cars. Our school's curriculum has many projects and reports. They can be done only by the help of a computer. You can research people and places and or get pictures. You can also book flights for far away trips and buy cars and other items off the internet. We even have the capability to talk with friends on facebook and twitter. Computers have a positive influence on people.",10
129,"Dear @CAPS1: The effects that computers have on me is that it teaches me hand-eye coordination. I learn stuff from the computer, and it is a fun thing to go on. But, I mean those are only my opinions. Well im gonna just go ahead and explain them to you. The good thing about computers is that it teaches you hand-eye coordination which helps you see better with your eyes. Also it helps you with your hands by making you learn how to catch stuff and how to react quickly with your hands. For example I was playing baseball and I couldn't catch very good and I was also learning how to use the computer and because I was able to type fast my hands reacted when I got grounders and pop fly's hit to me. So I was so happy that I lerned how to use the computer and type. But for sure the computer is the best because you can research stuff and you find out more important facts. Also you are learnen more when ever you research anything. I'll tell you one thing though, I like the computer so much because it helps me find out important details and facts about the person that I am doing my project on. Yes I know the computer is so fun because you can go on different websites such as myspace.com, youtube.com, and funnyjunk.com. I go on mspace to talk to my friends and to meet new people that's what I like about myspace I meet new people and make new friends. I go on youtube because I like to listen to music and I watch music videos on their also I watch skate board videos too cause I love to skate! But one thing for sure is that I go on funnyjunk.com to play games cause they have so much fun games that you can play. But my favorite game is @CAPS2 the hedgehog. In conclusion those are @NUM1 opinions and @NUM1 reasons to support the effects about computers. So I want you to think about some effects about computers and your opinions about computers and compare them to my opinions? But hey! That's up to you only if you want to.",8
130,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that the computer is good for the society because, @CAPS2 and student's do most of the studies online. We spend most of our time with our family and friends so we want a little bit of time to ourselves. We learn much more on the computer because it has a lot of facts. After reading this essay I hope you will agree with my position. @CAPS2 student's put most of their notes on a laptop and study what they did in class on the computer. @CAPS6 they need to look something for history class they have internet. High @CAPS3 @CAPS4 don't like going to the library so they go on the internet as there source. So @CAPS6 a student has a project due and the teacher wants it neat the computer will write the project neatly. The computer/internet has became a big source of learning to our society don't you agree? Our time most of the time is spent with our families @CAPS7 not our friends came over. Go outside and play with them, sit down and play games. Our families we are so little bit of time to ourselves computer won't hurt nobody. We don't on forever we friends or search something useful @CAPS5 we talked to our families @CAPS6 we go online searching for they couldn't fire. People countries to see @CAPS7 enough to visit for @CAPS7 they wanna that country they need a resource that is up to date. A computer is constantly updated with new fact's about everything. I hope after reading this you will agree with my position. Mostly every person has a computer and it does not effect there lives a lot. A computer is a great resource for the public. People wanna meet new people so they use a computer to do so student's want a great grade on those project so they wanna present it nicely. I believe agreeing with you be a very good choice.",8
131,"A large amount of people use computers daily, but not everyone agrees this technology benefits society. I think that computers benefit our way of life in many ways.

They say that this powerful technology has been more effective and quicker. My cousin and I were both given the same research paper to do. He used several books to get information on the topic and I used the computer. The project took me @NUM1 days to do, while it took him a whole week to complete. @PERSON1, computer programming expert, said, ""Computers have made receiving information so much faster. I vehemently believe that everyone should own this device. Moreover, computers help with communication.

Not only isit great for bands but it is great for college students. My older brother is a college student and we communicate through these websites so it seems like he is never that far away. The computer can also help with business. Meeting can be done through @ORGANIZATION2 or a different webchat service. Emails are a great way to send information. @NUM2 of business meetings are held over the internet has benefited work ethics. Please heed my advice and use the internet and computer. It will benefit your way of communication and your way of getting information.",10

In our modern day society computers are crucial tools that help organize files, do reasearch, and pleasurable online networking. Computers teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and allow people to socialize online. Without computers wouldn't life be difficult? While routinely doing our everyday computer tasks seldom do we realize that we are writing which frequently over works nerves in the hand causing tendonitis or arthritis; typing on computers is quicker and less harmful to the hands. ""Hand eye coordination helps improve balance and athleticisniry."" said @PERSON1 the chief othopedic sergeon of @ORGANIZATION1. Some people beg to differ and believe spending not less time on the computer can contribute to lack of physical activity. There are several portible computer devices that can be brought outside to use while walking like a @CAPS3. Every since I was, ten years old I dreamed of going to @LOCATION1. Although I couldn't afford a plane ticket to @LOCATION1, I was able to use the internet to take virtual tours of the vibrant landscapes and ancient historic venues throughout the country. With the help of internet I was able to see a far away place and experience the country as if I was there. @PERSON2, the creator of an online webcom called @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON2 created this computer system in order to allow people to connect all over the world by giving them the opportunity to see and speak to anyone they chosse to.

133,"Dear @CAPS1, Everyone love computers right? Those computers can help us with anything. They also give people facts about faraway places. And not only that but if you have someone that live's away, you can chat with them online! What would this world be with no computers. First of all, I would like to talk about how computer can help us with anything. Computers can give us picture of places, you can watch videos, and even see movies for free! Also you can check the weather, and if going to an airport you can check the flight time or if it has been canceled or not. There is just so many things that the computer can help us with! Now, it can also give you facts opinions, pictures, videos, and movies about faraway places. Like one time I was going to @LOCATION1 to visit but there was a terrible storm over there so the flight was canceled and I went on the computer and checked and it told me that it was canceled. Also if you somewhere faraway you can watch videos about that place. They also have maps to guide you through the way. And not only that but you can also check the highway for traffic so you wouldn't be stuck there. Wow imagine living without a computer! Third of all, if you can chat online with your friends or family! If you miss someone or you just want to talk there is websites that let you do that. Like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4! And you also see the person if you attach a camera to you computer, it's called video-chatting. And you can do this anyone, anywhere, at any time! In conclusion, all of this can only be done with a computer. Helping you with anything. Giving people facts about faraway places. And, you can talk online. There's many more but for you to know that you'll need to go to the store and get yourself a computer!",9

135,"Dear Newspaper, Advances in technology, while amazing, don't always have a positive effect on society. That is why, I honestly believe computers do not benefit my community. For instance, computers can be very dangerous and people these days just seem to spend too much time using them! Not to mention, computers cost way too much money. To begin, my mom and dad always say, ""don't talk to strangers,"" when I go out. I think they should say the same when I go to use my computer. Computers can truly be dangerous for someone who isn't careful. For example, online predators often depict themselves as someone they aren't. Therefore, you can't ever really trust someone you simply met in a chat room. Also, cyber bullying is another problem computers put people at risk for. Another danger computers have, is anything posted on the internet can be accessed by almost anyone. This includes pictures, blogs, comments and. I believe society would be better off without the constant worry of a computer! Secondly, people, especially the younger generation, spend excessive amounts of time on computers. Some people spend hours each day using a computer when they could be doing an activity that actually benefited them. If people spent just as much time helping their community as much time helping their community as they did on the computer, the world would be a much better place to live. Not to mention, it would bring people closer to one another. Computers seem to control peoples' lives and that just isn't healthy. I think people should spend more time living and less time with their faces glued to a computer screen! Lastly, computers are like vampires, sucking away your money. In @DATE1's economy people need to be saving their money for college or even simpler things like a new pair of shoes! Additionaly, at the rate that technology is advances, even the most high-tech computers are out of date in a year or two and a new one is needed. Also, computers' prices are constantly rising. It is very hard to keep up! I strongly believe computers are a waste of money and bring society down. All in all, computers just are a negative attribute in communities across the @LOCATION1. First off they can be dangerous. Secondly, they are too time consuming and, thirdly, computers are too expensive. Computers just simply are a hassle in @DATE1's world.",10
136,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are a vey unique and advanced device. They give entetainment, pleasure, and knowledge for some people. I do not agree with the fact that computers are a good part of society. Although you do need computers. There are some reasons to which I am saying this. Typing s faster than hand writing and its neater. With all the different websites, you can advertise and buy important thing bat the internet and talk to people froma round the world. With all of these good reasons there should be an instant choice of it they're good or bad. But there is a main reason. It's areason that tells it is bad. Computers are for people. People had can't get off their write a hand written report or drive to the store to buy something. Not it. If computers never exiled, the world would no doubt be better all around place. There a lot of reason in which computers are bad. They hold information which can be hacked and by somebody thay you don't want to know something. Cyber bullying is a bad thing about computer. Another big is those stupid online games. People get addicted then they become lazy and eventually obese. So as I said before, part of society and should be. This would be of good importance to me if you took my letter into. Remember that computers can take advantage of your life and make you into you're not. make that descision I hope that you live a full life and enjoy reading my letter. P.S.

137,"Dear residents of @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there has been some controversy about whether or not computers are a good thing and/or helpful to society. I strongly believe that computers are a very helpful resource that make day to day life easier. Computers can help us in so many ways including making learning easier, helps students do better in @CAPS4, nad serves as a great teaching tool. One reason that I support computers is because they make learning easier. You might ask hao a screen and a keyboard can make learning easier, @CAPS1 sounds crazy, but its true! Let's say you're a middle @CAPS4 student that has been assigned to write a paper on a designated topic; @CAPS2 instead of spending hours upon hours looking for the right information in a library, you could just google search what your topic in and @CAPS3! You have exactly what you need to know in front of you within seconds, prettty cool right? Still don't believe computers are helpful? What if I told you @CAPS1 allowed students to do better in @CAPS4? That's right, computers allow students to do better in @CAPS4. Websites such as edline allow teachers to post their students grades very quickly. How is this helpful? When you take a quiz your treacher has to grade over @NUM1 quizzes! And with things like absentees, weekends and vacations, the day you get your quiz back gets delayed further. Sometimes kids don't get their quizzes back for two weeks after they took them! By the time you get @CAPS1 back @CAPS1's time for a chapter test with @PERCENT1 of your grade and you just found out you didn't do @CAPS2 on one of the sections! This lowers your ability to do @CAPS2 on the test. But if your grade was posted on the internet days before , you will have more time to study and know what to study and you will do @CAPS2 on the test. As you can see, computers are very helpful for students, but are they good for teachers too? The answer is yes, computers are a good teaching tool. Has this ever happened to you? No matter how much your teacher explains to you, @CAPS1 just seems like there are speaking another language? @CAPS2 what if they showed you a cool video on youtube explaining @CAPS1? Would you learn better with a visual in front of you? I sure would. Computers are also great for teachers because @CAPS1 gives them the ability to email other teachers if there is a problem and get the latest information about the @CAPS4 and what's going on. Do you understand why computers are useful, now? I hope you realize how useful computers are because they make learning easier, allow students to do better in @CAPS4, and are a great learning tool. These are only some of the many reasons computers are useful and I hope you keep using them in our community.",10
138,"The use of computers is definetly correct. It is helpful, you can discover new things and much more. Computers makes peoples lives just so much simpler. Computers can help people in magnificent ways by looking for things you despretly need. Like if you were a student and you had to write a paper on @PERSON1. The computer has internet and that like billions of facts @PERSON1 and much more information about every thing. It can be helpful also by looking up the wheather, the new, even things that are happening around the world and even answering questions you have. Discovering things on the computer is something that happens every day. For example I read an article about the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 the next day my teachers gave us a pop quiz on that and I got @NUM1. If a computer can get somebad a @NUM1 on their test think of what else it could do for the world. It might even help sae lives. Of course a computer can be helpful. In way like cheeking the score from yesterdays game, see whats going on in your community, watch videoes, hear music, talk to your friends, relatives get information on places, medical stuff. A computer can basicly do every thing from looking up the games scores to saving a life. The use of computers is, obviously the best dicision.",7
139,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 people acknowledge the great advances that computers give us, but they also put us at @CAPS1 disadvantages. Computers have been known to help develop health issues. As people become more intune with the online world, they tend to interact with their family less. Don't forget the danger of online predators - they're deadly. @CAPS1 people who do nothing, but watch television are often refered to as cauch potatoes. Those who are glued to their computer screens are no better. It is stated by numerous of @LOCATION2's top doctors that too much time spent on the computer can cause damage to your health. Exercise is highly stressed by doctors around the globe and the only exercise a computer addict will be doing is typing up a storm. They can submerge themselves into obesity. This often causes depression as it begins to sink in. Addition itself is a serious health issue. I wouldn't be surprised if they add a computer wing to rehab centers sometime in the near future. These problems are slowly spreading and we must come together to abolish them! Family time is an treasured value, to the @CAPS2 people, but lately, computers are ruining this tradition. With so @CAPS1 people absorbed with online drama, friends, and even video games, family interaction is declining. People slowly remove themselves from reality and enter an alternate world of cyberspace. They @MONTH1 only emerge from their rooms to use the bathroom and eat, scarcely resting. This can cause great tension or sorrow in @CAPS1 families. Who can erase the horrifying stories of abduction from their memories? Online predators are highly dangerous and extremely clever. Your children could be talking to someone they believe is another teenager looking for a friend to console in when, really, they are a forty-year-old serial killer waiting to find the right time to attack. Studies show that one fourth of online users have had an encounter with a dangerous person.",8
140,"Dear Local Newspaper, The question everyone is asking if computers benfit society? I believe that computers don’t because you can’t get exercise if youre always on the computers and @CAPS2's really hard to enjoy nature too. Another reason comuters don't benefit society is that you aren't interacting with friends and family. hopfully I have encouraged you to not use computers as much and go have fun with your family. If you are always on the computer how are you going to get exercise? @CAPS2's proven that more than half of united states of @CAPS1 is over weight. Exercising is more important than using the computer and knowing that you could be doing something use that you know is better wouldn't you do @CAPS2? Interacting with poeple is important to do because you can meet new people and if you don;t then you might learn to be shy and not make as much friends as you like @CAPS2's true taht oyu can make new friends over the computer but @CAPS2's not the some meeting them in person. Also if you do make a ""friends"" over the internet, you don't know if they are a stalker or a murderer. I urge you to go out and meet new people and not on the internet. knowing that you are better off not using the computer and being with the poeple you like, wouldn't you do @CAPS2? Yes you can play games on the computer but @CAPS2 would be ebtter if you play @CAPS2 with your fmaily. To answer the question everyone is asking I believe that computers don't benefit society at all and hopfully I have encouraged you to believe this too. ",7
141,"Dear @CAPS1, I am aware of the current debate about technology, however more spacificly computers. Computers are a helpful interesting & even fun peace of technology. Computers open the world to new people & places & limmiting that is uncalled for. Computers are keys to inavation & creation. When @ORGANIZATION1 did a study on the use of computers @PERCENT1 of people said they got their news files & even planned threw the computer & now @PERCENT2 of creations are being done through the computer. This illustrates the power of computers allowing people to do things that were once impossible. Now humans are capable of spreading info around the world in seconds. Computers also business grow through advertisment or work softwares. Computers are the key to help open the world to new possabilities & options not possible @NUM1 years ago. I understand my oposition is not only against computers but wants to limit there use. That is unfair & possibly unconstitutional. They argue that people exercise less due to computers, however @PERCENT3 of people, when asked has computers negativly impacted your exercise said ""no"" & one man stated ""because of computers I learned new workouts & even found a great local trainer."" @CAPS2 you can understand computers are not just about games & toys, but allowing people to grow & learn more to help them find plasas to travel & assist in their exercise. Computers are a wonderful tool when it comes to communication. Emails, @CAPS3 and other softwares allow people to communicate accross the world. @CAPS2 the world begins to inovate itself communication is key. People are capable of spreading news in seconds, infact @PERCENT4 of news is now done through the computer. New @CAPS4 times & the wall street @CAPS5 have moved their news mainly to the internet allowing people across the to see them. Work is also primairly done through the computer now. People are able to send files, ship & even order online. Even important business meeting are done throught the computer, where all the people can be at their house. Computers are neccesity when it comes to communications work & news. I hope you understand & put to use my opoinon. Computers are needed to grow @CAPS2 a world solving problems comunicating & expanding that is why I belive there is no problems with computers.",9
142,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I have heard that people are thinking of how computers are having a bad effect on people and I disagree. Computers help people so much in schools, work places, and at home. Not having computers would have a worse effect on people then with having computers. For students it is an absolute neccesity to do research , and type essays, letters and so many other writing pieces, and the same goes for all of society. In almost every school all over the country, students use computers on a daily basis. I personally have to log into the computer to type an essay for a class at least twice a week and some @ORGANIZATION1 even more. For example my @CAPS1 teacher asks our class to write a lot of essays or letters. She has told us over and over that if our hand writing is not good she won't grade it. Having the computers to type on removes the fact that if our teacher can't read it she can't grade it. I understand that people would say that it makes people need to hand write the things a lot less and people would lose the ability to hand write things but with such advenced technology on computers and to type anything with such pose, soon hand writing will no longer ne required. Any person for whatever research they need can be found so easily using a computer. For students in any grade level and any class, research projects are going to be assigned by a teacher. Using books and other means of research are slow and in efective. Getting onto a computer and looking up the pic is fast and simple and gives better results than books. The same goes for jobs, for example a person might need to set up a powerpoint presentation. Not only does the computer have powerpoint on it - which is an effective way of setting up projects the computer allows that person to do research all in one place. This makes it so much simplier to get a lot of information and not have to run around getting books and talking to people who know the subject. I understand that computers could ""take control"" of people and people would spend to much time on them. But of the few that do stay on computers to long learn to balance their time, keeping computers would benefit in so many ways. Writing many different essays, letters, typing for projects, and doing research would be done faster and easier.",8
143,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 are a major part in everyday life. They are used by just about everybody. There are so many benefits if you know how to use one propurly. They help you through everyday life whether your trying to find this song that is stuck in your head or trying to file you taxes, computers are a nececity in every house hold. They are also a great way to learn. You can look up a question that has been buging you or you could learn to play a new song on your favorite instrement. Either way your learning. So I think that computers deffinetly have more of a positive effect on society then a negative one. Computers are also a great way to interact with family and friends. Some computers even have built in cameras that lets you hold conversations with peers through the computer while seeing each other. This is great if you have family that lives far away, or your in a long distance relationship. Another benefit from the computer is that it is great for organizing things. Wheither it been @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 you can count on your computer to keep it all organized some computers also have a built in callendar that could help you plan out your day. But say you don't know what to do that day. Well that brings me to my next point. Computer are also great for looking up places. For instance say you fly to @LOCATION1 for the first time on a buisness meeting and you arrive a few days before the meeting. So maybe you diside to go sight seeing to some of @LOCATION1's most eligant spots, but have a computer you could look up some spots and be on your way to having a great day. Overall I think that computers make the world go round. They will never die out, that is why everybody should know how to use one, and if you don't you should hurry and learn as soon as possible.",8
144,"Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe computers can be bad for society. My reasons being people are spending to much time on their computers, less time exercising, and lose interacting with family and friends. My first reason why i think computers are bad for our society is people are spending to much time on them. I know when i get home from school the computer is all i can think about until i go on. It's like an addiction. People spend all their time on a social net work other then going out and meeting new people. My second reason is people spend less time exercising. Ive been over a friends house before, and all we did was play computer games instead of enjoying nature outside. Alot of @CAPS1 don't make healthy food choices, so why not go out and exercise? It's because of the computer. Ive seen my little brother spend his whole saterday eating in front of the computer and playing games. It's just unhealthy. My last and final reason is it takes time away from family and friends ive spent my whole day after school in my room on the computer. It's like when your on the computer nothing else matters because you think ""hey why not just talk to my friends over @CAPS2, or myspce, or facebook! you lose a lot of friendships like this. Also you lose friendship with you family because you badly talk to them while your on the computer. Half the time im to busy talking to someone i don't know then helping my little brother with home work, or helping my mom clean the house. In conclusion these are my three reasons why i think the computer is bad for sivilization. I really hope you take all this into consideration and really think what the computer can do to @CAPS1 I people once again those three resons are one, people are spending to much time on their computer. Two, spend less time exercising. Three, lose interactions with family and friends.",8
145,"Dear @CAPS1, Experts agree that people go outside and exercising because their are three reason why people should go outside and there are: people don't have a lot of exercising, they can hang out with their friend and family, and people and kid should enjoying the outsid nature. Let me explain, people and kids these days do have alot of exercising. People who don't exercising can gran weight if they don't exercising at all. Also, parents and kids who spend all day on their computer or laptop can be over weight. Kids these day, have hard time to exercising because there are over weight by staying on their computer and play their computer game. Wouldn't you agree the kids and adults can hang out with there frienda and family. Kids need to stop going on the computer and go outside more offing with their friend or family. You might want to consider that parent need to spend time with there friend and family then staying on the computer at home. Don't you think that people should go outside and enjoying the nature. Amazingly, people know what nature is but the don't know what the true meaning of nature is! Adult should spend time by going outside then stayin at their house because @PERCENT1 of the world dont have computer at all.",7
146,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers are an amazing advantage to use in this modern day and age. They are easy to learn how to use, you can connect with old friends, and even learn by going to an online school or college they offer. Computers are amazing advancement and this is why you should use one. Who doesn't like computers? They are easy to learn how to use and are in a variety of forms. Almost every college student has a computer or laptop. They could have never used one before, but then they learned how easy it was. Most computers come already installed with the necessary programs including: @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or some form of @CAPS2, a virus protection software, and other simple software. Moving is very hard, you leave a place where you have so many friends to a place that is so new to you. Computers make this so much easier by letting you connect with them without having to wait for the mail by writing letters. There is email, facebook, and myspace that let you chat with old friends, new friends, or even parents. Some people say that these things are dangerous, that is only if you start talking to people you don't know. People keep coming up with even more ways to stay connected so don't miss out on the opportunity. These people are so smart, they figured out a way to have school online. This is very helpful to somebody who is injured or is trying to get another degree to get a better job. People get assignments to do and each class only takes about one or two months. People get to do their job or enjoy nature still because their day is open and not busy. Sure people don't get to enjoy the campus, but with the price of gasoline these days, it's worth it. So don't be the person sitting around doing nothing, buy a computer and stay in touch with technology. Remember computers are easy to use, you can stay connected to friends and you can go to school on them. This technology can help you more than it can hurt you.",9
147,"Dear @CAPS1 -in-@CAPS2, Computers are very helpfull tools in todays society and culture. They build cognitive skills and offer a vast wealth of knowledge. I want you to understand all the benefits a computer provides. First off, computers enchance our hand-eye coordination skills. When typing, we look at the screen, while using our hands to type this becomes almost second-nature after a period of time, proof that it is helping with this cognitive skill. Having good hand-eye coordination is a critical part of driving, and many other tracks we perform throughout the day. Also, you must consider the near infinite amount of knowledge available on this tool. You can learn just about anything on the internet, and most of it is absolutely free. In fact, on websites like @CAPS3 alone, you can find a webpage, dedicated to just about anything. Contrary to the counter-arguments belief, a computer can actually aid in our social life. With instatn messengers like @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1 you can converse with people around the world in real time. Social networks like @CAPS5 allow your to keep your friends posted on what you are doing. Please take my letter into account, and publish it in your editorial. I believe computers help us with cognitive skills, learning, and socializing. Thank for your time.",8
148,"Dear local newspaper, it has came to @CAPS2 attention that many people do not agree if computers have a beneficial or bad affect on those who use them. In @CAPS2 oppinion they are not beneficial. First when on the computer people have less time to exercise. Also, computers don't always have approprate sites. Finally, people have less time to interact with family and friends. I believe for these reasons that computers have bad affects on people. Without a doubt people who spend hours on the computer everyday have less time to excersice @NUM1 in every @NUM2 young adults are obiese. This is because most teens sit inside watching @CAPS1 or going on the internet instead of being active. Some students are so addicted to computers they never go outside! I understand that computers can be helpful to do school work but, kids who never get off can have life threatening weight problems in the future. As you know many web sites that are not appropriate for teenagers are accesible to them on the computer. Parents have to constantly worry what their child/children are doing just to make sure it is not bad. If less teens used computers as often as they do they would be lifting a nof their parents shoulders. I remember reading a newspaper article about a girl named @PERSON1 on a website chatting with a ""@NUM3 year old guy who later came and found her and turned out to be @NUM4. If kids were not so addicted to the computer than they wouldnt get into these websites. many teens spend there whole day on the computer leaving no time for their family and friends. For example when a friend calls and asks @CAPS2 brother to go skateboarding he says he is busy when he is just on facebook, @CAPS2 friend once said to me ""sorry I can't go to the pool today I am going to play rollercoaster tycoon."" With this attitude toward outdoor activities I am not surprised that students wasting time on computers do not have time for family or friends. As you can see computers effect many people in a negative way. They prevent people from ecersising, expose kids to in approplate websites, and take away from valuable time with family and friends. I hope everyone agrees thet computer aren't beneficial to people.",9
149,"Dear editors, I was planning on taking a trip to @LOCATION1. I found directions within a second using a computer. Computers are great, people friendly pieces of equipment, but as technology evolves, people are beginning to rely on their computers for entertainment. Some people @MONTH1 disagree, but there are many outdoor activities that are more healthy then sitting around on the computer all day such as socializing, the great-outdoors, and other on sports. Familiar with @CAPS1 is a great program for socializing but there are many stronger dangers. Did you know that anybody can view your profile which contains personal info? You don't always have to chat online. Call up a friend and hang out at maybe a local movie theatre. Many people, and I agree, think seeing a movie with their pals is alot more entertaining then playing online chess or any other virtual game with a friend a fan of movies? No problem! go on a walk or a bike ride or walk your dog while riding a bike! There are so many. @ORGANIZATION1 park. What an amazing place to spend your vacation camp outs at @TIME1, bikes during the day, its a wonderful part of nature and the best part of you a park anywhere in the world! Camp out on the weekend place to become closer with your family and friends. Hiking is a popular part of a parks and can be performed by all ages, so go out and spend a weekend in the great outdoors! Not looking at a computer screen. Soccer, baseball, basketball and lacrosse. These are just come of the many fun sports. Out there, and yes, they are certainly fun and healthy. Every town I know about has sport fields where many kids and adults of all ages use. it also a great way to make friends! Get to know them in person and not over the internet. Daily exercise while having fun beats just having fun on a computer. What are you waiting for? Stop reading this article and go out and meet new friends. Visit a local park or play a sport for fun. If I were to name everything to do other than use a computer, it wouldn't fit in this entire newspaper. So go explore!",10
150,"To whom this @MONTH1 concern Computers are a great source of technology, but many people spend to much time on them. People don't get to see the out-side world because they are to ""busy"" on their computers, and use them to find things or play games that they can do just outside in the fresh air. Computers are and people spend to much time on them instead of having an outdoor experience, exercising, and talk and bonding with their family and friends. First of all, people don't enjoy nature as much as they enjoy their computers. When you're stuck in side school or work, you don't get to go outside and see the natural beauty of nature, so when you get out take @NUM1 minutes or so to go and enjoy the wilderness. You don't have to go outside every day, but once in a while it feels good to get out and explore the world. Expecially when you had a little break and what to be alone, in nature, you can get away and lose your stress. Some @MONTH1 say you can enjoy nature and explore new places online, and yes you wouldn't you want to do it first-hand? You don't get the real experience by just looking at pictures. You have to be their and explore it by yourself. In nature there is always some thing new. Secondly, when you are on your computer, you didn't doing anything your body, you need to go exercise. Fresh air is good for you, you. Spending most of your time on your computer, you don't spend time with your family and friends. Family is the most important thing in your life, and as you get older, the time you have with your family get less and less. You also @MONTH1 see you friends in school or at work everyday but you don't really get to sit and ""catch up"" with each other. Online their are programs where you can chat with friends and family, but wouldn't you want to see them personaly, especially if you don't see them everyweek. It's a better experience and you made many more moments. Just going out far which or even going on a run can give you time with your loved ones. In conclusion, people spend to much time on their computers. They don't get to experience the outside world and the wonders of nature. The more on their computers, the less exercise they get and less fresh air. Family and friends some of the greatest things in your life, dont get to bond with you,. Computers are good for using spread sheets and typing essays, but they aren't good for you to spend all your time on, mailing it, and missing out on the adventures your life will venture through",10
151,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 more people are getting involved with using the computer while I think that is great other don't. I believe that using a computer is a good thing because technology is going to progress and computers will be the base, also computers are safer now because or privacy options and virus block. Finally, computers help you gather knowledge that no one book could tell you. Although technology is progressing computers are only the basics. Sooner or later everything will be based on computers like, jobs, school, and ever the medical field. Jobs will have more computers and touch screen devises because they are easier and more technologicly advanced. As for school @CAPS1 students have to take computer classes to learn how to write brouchures and make websites. The medical field is now using more advanced ultrasounds that take the image and make it there dementional. So, if everything is changing around you why do you want to be stick in the past? Although, some people are worried about internet saftey and viruses, there are ways that those can be limited. As for social networking sites don't set it up for the whole world to see. Set it up for only your friends to see. Also, make sure you know who your friends are. As for viruses, don't go on websites that cause viruses. Also, you can get a virus blocker that helps eliminate them. The computer also helps to give you and get you knowledge. You can learn about cocrent civilizations. Or modern day without taking a step out of your house. Also the internet has vertual simulations so you can experence what it was like in other coultures, in other time pericals. Computers give you knowledge that help you through your life especially if you don't have a library. Even though some people disagree computers are the base of technology, safe, and full of knowledge I do. Yes, they do have some flaws but they are a great learning tool.",8
152,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 daily, I am writing you to address the issue of computers in our society today. Each day new discoverys are made from the people that use computers in our society, however many people say that computers are harmful to are communtiy. Today I am going to convince you and society that computers are not as much as on issue as some people say they are. To begin with discoverys in our nation have been advancing rapidly. Each day new discoverys are benefiting our society however they are only being made possible by the help of computers. Without computers some for dieseases would have never been discovered and more people. Would have died. Secondly, computers have also increased medical care and have been the cave between life or death. Finnaly, computers help speed up production rates of cars household neccessitys, and many more objects. Have you ever been bored at home and looking for something to do on that dark, rainy, chilly night? Yes, exactly what I thought well the new technology advances in social-networking can even help the most bored and lonelyest people and give them something to do. Even if your just looking to talk to someone you can easily do that on the internet. So you people out there looking for that special someone will always be able to look somewhere. With all the social networks like twitter, myspace, facebook, and youtube you will always have something to do. During this economic recestion it seems that finding a job is so hard, however the internet comes to the rescue yet again. The internet can help you find a job twice if not three times as fast. Many people also speed up their word by using the computer. With microsoft things are lot easier to do work that you need to make up I hope that everyone can understand how much the computer help you, rather then hurt you. @CAPS1 of the newspaper, I hope you and the rest of the community can see that computer help you more that they hurt you. Thank you very much for your time and effort that you put in to listen to me.",8
153,"Dear Newspaper, I think Computers are good for many things and are useful for anyhting. I believe this because every year new and exciting @CAPS1 and websites are created and make life easier. For example, ""@CAPS2"" is a way to communicate with friends and family. For me I have family out-of-state, and I am happy when I go on @CAPS2 and speak to them. Or I can also talk to friends after a long day of school. Another example is ""youtube."" On youtube They have how to videos that show you step-by-step instructions on anything, even on news and music entertrainment. Other @CAPS1 like word, help you set up writing essays and @CAPS4 stories. On powerpoint it lets you make slide show videos for school projects to presentations. Even excel let's you make graphs and any char t imaginable. And let's not forget @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 helps you when you need info on a person, place, or thing.

154,"Dear Readers, I understand that some @MONTH1 think computers can effect peoples' lives. This is because it causes them to not go outside excersising and enjoying nature. My point of view is that people have the choice to go out side, exercise, and enjoy nature. Computers give so much information that it could give people ideas of fifferent activities people can do outdoors. Computers also have abilities to download videos and other soft ware that people can look at and perform excersing with them, and learn techniques. In my life my mom and dad, and many other people im my family, look online at different websites to see what activities we can do on the weekends and seasonal activities. Computers are very important and are life changing. If it wasn't for computers some people wouldn't be able to get an education. Doctors, police officers, and banks use computers for thier job and it helps us go through are everyday lives with ease. From what i see and understand i that computers have a positive effect on our lives. Computers can be negative but it all has to do with self control and how you use it.",8
155,Dear newspapper I don't think that computers benefit our society. I don’t believe that computers can be dangerous they make people lazy and you can be easily scammed on the computer. One reason why I don’t think that computers benefit society is because it is very dangerous. Computers are dangerous because people can get kidnapped or herrassed. The town of @LOCATION1 police @CAPS1 says that over @PERCENT1 of kidnappings are from people that were met on social networks such as myspace and facebook. The police cheif also says that their are many cusses about people being herrassed by stalkers or people trying to harm them. Another reason why I dont think computers benifit us is because you can be scammed very easily on the computer. @PERCENT2 of people say that they have lost large ammounts of money due to credit card scam's on the computer. On computers their are sites that will act as if they are selling you something and take your credit card number and all of the other information that you give them and they will take your card and buy thing with it and you will have to pay for it credit card companies say that most credit card scams and frauds happen over the computer. The final reason why I don't believe that computers benifit us is because they make people lazy. Computers make people lazy because they are packed with a bunch of fun things like video games and you can watch videos and you could shop and you could see just about anything on a computer. I did some research and found that @PERCENT3 of people that are over weight have account's on multiple sites on computers. These are the reasons why I dont think computers benifit us. I hope you too heed to my advice.,8
156,"Click, click, click the mouse of a computer goes as you are searhcing throughout the internet. Computers are a great way to teach kids how to be social, make people more intellegent, and help you with your homework, I believe that computers have a very positivr effect on people. Computers can touch kids to be social because first off computers are like an online phone, you can talk to people in so many ways, facebook caht, aim(chat),, myspace, twitter, skype, and a lot of others ways that i havent mentioned. Also I think is a teen or kid or even adult that is too nervous to talk to people on the phone or in person, and is socialy not their or painfully shy can start of by just chatting with people online. Once they feels more comfoatable, then they can start talking to the person on the phone or in person. For example, I once @MONTH1 this girl who was very sweet, but was painfully shy and everyone for it, so one day she decided to make an aim nad talk to poeple on it, and provove that she isn'e a annoying wherd girl that everyone makes her out to be. She turned out to be one of the nicestly funniest person I ahve hung out with in a while. Which how internet can help you. HAve you ever felt that computers sometimes make you more intellegent? Well, in my opinion I think that computers help out so much more than a book. If you want information its just about typing some keys and a click of a button. Ahving a computer is like your own personal handbook of veerything in the world. A lot of people these days study from the internet, I know I sure do. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 more people say, that computers are more helpful than books and can make you a lot more intellegent, because the internet has so much more deatil than books, and mor efacts. @PERCENT2 of kids that have a computer use it for homewrok. Computers is a great tool to use while you are doing your homework. I spend most of the day on my computer doing homework than off it. For example, say you have a report and you need facts on @CAPS1 @PERSON1, and where he was born. You would jus type in, ""when was @ORGANIZATION1 boen."" and born! There it is with the date exactly. Also if you having a piece of writing like your rough draft so why spend the time trying to write really neat and perfect? When you can just open up a word document and type it up. To sum everything up computers have deffenatly a positive effect on people from these three reasons, computers are a great way to teach kids hohw to be social, make people more intellegent, and help you with your homework, But I understand where your coming from people are spending way to much time on their computer and less time exersising, but you can look up great ways to exersise on the internet and watch videos of people that have @CAPS2.V shows about exersising and do it with them on the computer. Remember, computers aren'@CAPS2 just a waste of time and way to will your brain cells. they have a very positive effect on you. ",10

Interacting with friends and family is always a . Maybe you do not understand if you have been assigned in a certain class. You @MONTH1 add a friend and you will tell you what has . Talking to family members can do good for you in many ways. You can be having some trouble in your socical life, you can always talk to a family member or friend secretly through the @CAPS1. I remember having some difficulties with a few friends and one of my cousins gave me very good advice through an instant messaging program named ""@CAPS2"". I garantee you will have a good time using a @CAPS1. There are many games out there that you @MONTH1 enjoy. Playing these games, will teach hand-eye coordination, says @PERSON2. You can meet new people who can also give you good advice. As you computers have a lot of positive effect on people. You can interact with family and friends, recieve a lot of help for school work and meet a lot of new people. Take my advice and buy a @CAPS1.",10
158,"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Your resources, your entertainment, even your communication with people might be fading. @CAPS8 you know a large portion of people think this @PERSON2 is harming our society. Well I will say I think they don't understand these benifit that computers bring us. Computer act like teachers teaching us without us even knowing it. Hand-eye coordination is a perfect example. Plus, we use computers to learn about places we might want to travel to, or have a conversation with frinds or family living ways away tromus. Computers is an extrodarny piece or technology. First, I like to say everything that you do physically uses hand-eye coordination. Making dinner, riding a bike, driving a car etc. And unfortiunitly not @CAPS6 people are the best at hand-eye coordination. One of @CAPS7 friends, @PERSON1, had horriable hand eye coordination. So for his birthday I decided an getting him a computer. It's been @NUM1 month since his he had his computer and @CAPS8 he was trying to hit a baseball at his sons party, he moneged to hit the ball @NUM2 out of @NUM3 where he used to hit it @NUM1 or @NUM5 out of @NUM6. @PERCENT2 is a termendous increase in only @NUM1 month! Just something @CAPS8 simple @CAPS8 a computer improved @CAPS7 friends hand-eye coordination a termendous amount. Secondly, the computer can help you learn about far away places @CAPS8 the @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION4. Do you really want to travel up to the icey cold, and piercing winds of the @LOCATION1 just to learn about it? For some I'd say like that but what if you cant travel up the @LOCATION1 due to money or flying conditions. I want to be able to study about polar bears and the glaciers without needing to worry. A statics from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of @CAPS5 states ""@PERCENT2 of people wpould love to experience the thrill and excitement of the @ORGANIZATION1 lights. But out of those @PERCENT2 only @PERCENT3 said they'd actually travel to @LOCATION2 to see them"". So you can see that @PERCENT4 of those people wouldn't go whether it be due to money or the cold. Thery @CAPS6 said thats why they love the computer. They can experience the @ORGANIZATION1 lights without needing to travel into the bitter cold.Lastly, that better thing to do on the computer than with family you've never met before or don't get to see them. The editor for the @LOCATION3 Local states ""@CAPS7 parents live over @NUM8 miles away. I rarly get to tell to them now because I can't afford to travel that distance ofter. So I use @CAPS7 computer, @CAPS7 parents and I now communicate @PERCENT1 more than we used to. I love the computer it helps keep me close to @CAPS7 loved ones."" @CAPS8 you can tell, thanks to the computer we talk @PERCENT1 more to his parents than he used to! In conclusion, the computer is a gracous device that is extremely benifital to people. The computer teaches us hand-eye coordination, lets us learn about places we other wise would never learn about, and to have conversations with friends or family that we generally dont get to see often. Now you go out and make anyone that says computers are a horrible inventions you tell them exactly why computers are so important!",12
159,"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever gone somewhere, taken pictures, and posted them on the computer? If you have you will remember where you visited. But atleast you went to @ORGANIZATION1, or @LOCATION1 or somewhere. There are some people who are on the computer all day. Instead of experiencing nature and taken on @CAPS1 life brings to them, they are on facebook or youtube all day. This disgusts me because there are many fun, beautiful, and entertainings things to do. In @CAPS2 opinion I think computers have negative effects on people. People miss out on enjoying nature or interacting with friends and family. Some people do not get exercise anymore and it hurts to see obese people just sit ther and do nothing about there lives. First I'd like to talk about obesity. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of children are obese at young a young age? Computers take the place of exercising for a young boy or girl. They should go outside and play sports like basketball or soccer. Another thing is those game websites. Children get so caught up in a computer game, everything around them just disappears. All they worry about is winning the game. While playing this game they might eating doritos. Sooner or later five pounds is gained. Then they will regret not exercising and not be able to move. Later in life, when things are bad for them, they will realized on how many fantastic things they missed. Then they will say ""@CAPS1 did I do with @CAPS2 life?"" @CAPS2 next point shows that people are not enjoying nature. Have you ever taken a nice walk in the park? I know I have. Well people sit inside all day just taking a peek out the window, but don't think about going outside. Nature is beautiful, smells nice, even refreshing at times. But no. People sit on there butt all day. On the computer accomplishing absolutely nothing. Why can't they go outsite for a walk or a jog? People can see animals like squirrels climbing up a tree. How cute. But instead they play a virtual game where you shoot squirrels with a paint ball gun. So much is missed because of computers. As much as not enjoying nature upsets me, some people blow off their own family just to watch a re-run of family guy on youtube. @CAPS1 have we come to? Some children hit their parents because the parents shut the computer off. I'd rather enjoy a meal with @CAPS2 family and then just sit down, relax, and talk. Also some people don't get sleep becuse they are ""doing something important"" and miss a family trip or even school. In conclusion I believe that computers are bad because of obesity, missing nature, and not enjoying company of family & friends.",10
160,"Computers, computers, computers. Who doesn't own them right? They teach hand eye coordination, give people to learn about faraway places and people can you actually believe some people say otherwise? I think that's pure bull !@. Computer's today help us with everyday tools, such as cars, cellphones and your everday television! Computer's also make work easier, and you interact with people! I for one think computers benefit society today, and those people who think otherwise should look into it one move step. Cellphones, cars, telephones want! There all made by mankind, but with a bit of technology. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of cars have computers biult in em? By the press of the button, all doors unlocked, by a swith the windows go down, yes, by computer. Now, how do computer's make life easier you say? Well keep reading to find out! The toothpaste, the baseball bats the pencils you we are all made by, the yoou know what! Machines, but programed with computer chips. Oh i remember when my history teacher told me that it took @NUM1 hours to make a baseball bat by a human from scratch. Now it takes like @NUM2 minutes with the help of comuters. If this isn't enough to tell you that computers benefit us, then what will?! Experts say people who use computers a lot don't get outside often to interact with family, but that's false I say! Cellphones are a everyday tool, we use them to talk with each other of long distant calls pay? Well then chat online on your own personal labtop! I hope now you believe computers do really benefit us. With there everday items we use, how they make work easier, and how it does make us interact. We use them everday, and hopefully they'll be around for the longest.",8
161,"Dear editor, I think that people are spending too much time on the computer. Because of this, people are getting less exersice, they are not spending enough time outdoors and the dont spend as much time with their family and friends. Exersicing is an important part of one's daily schedued. I have a friend who exersices everyday. She is the healthiest person I know and rarely spends anytime on the computer. But, she knows someone who is almost her compleate oposite. He hardly ever exersices and spends @NUM1 hours on the computer each day. He has also been diagnosed with diabeties and is obese. These are the type of health problems that are faced because of lack of exersice and too much computer time. Experts say that people should get at least @NUM2 minutes of exersice every day. But, because more and more people are spending time on computers, this is almost impossible. Studies done at @ORGANIZATION1 show that @PERCENT1 of kids under the age of @NUM3 are obese or at the risk of becaming obese because they are not getting enough exersice. You don't want that number to increase do you? There are other problems that people face because of too much time on the computer. People are spending less time outdoors and more time inside at a desk. My friend @PERSON1 spends way too much time on her computer and not enough outside. She failed a science poject because she was on her computer, rathern than outside comparing the leaves from different trees. Doctor @PERSON2 is a child phycologist and when he asked kids if they would rather play outside or be on a computer, @PERCENT2 of them said computer. This shows that people on computers are not only young, but they want to be on the computer more than be outside. This is a number that, in my opinion, is too high. Lastly, there is the problem of people not spending enough time with their family and friends. By this I mean face to face time, not just video chatting with your friends on facebook. This has caused tension in relationships. My friend @PERSON3 didn't go to her family reunion but stayed at home on the computer and at the next family get together, she was ostrisized because she didn't go to the reunion. High @ORGANIZATION1 guidance counselor @PERSON4 says that @NUM4 out of @NUM5 friendships are ruined because kids dont spend enough face to face time with their friends but are on the computer. These are all god reasons why less time on the computer and more time exersicing, outside, and with family and friends will make your life happier and healthier.",10
162,"Dear Readers, @CAPS1 of the most important inventions of the past decades is the computer, and it has its pros and cons. I think people spend to much time on computers, especially teenagers. They spend to much time on @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, and not enough time outside enjoying nature and playing sports or exercising. While they @MONTH1 talk with friends with @CAPS4, it is not the same as going to the park with friends and playing a game of baseball. Families also are distant form each other when they sit around on @CAPS5. Teenagers spend too much time on the @CAPS6 going where they should instead of doing more benefitul activities like reading. I sure we all know at least @CAPS1 obese person or teenager. My neighbor is the size of a killer whale and eats just about as much as @CAPS1. He will sit on the computer chair and stare with his eyes glazed at the computer chair and stare with his eyes glazed at the computer screen for hours on end. Sometimes I wonder how many brain cells he wastes per second. I will bet that everyone who reads this knows someone like my neighbor. The statistic @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2 is obese is not exagrated at all. In my opinion, it is the fault of the @CAPS6 and computers. Instead of going to the gym or the soccer field with friends, they got to the computer and talk and eat junk food. They spend their time watching pointless @CAPS5 videos, while they should be playing baseball or football. Doubters say you learn hand-eye cordination with computers, but you can learn better with sports. Computers are a large factor in obesity because they encourage @CAPS1 to sit around instead of doing standard @NUM1 minutes a day of exercise. The next pressing issue is the amount of reading the average teenager and @CAPS9 does. I would say that the average gets about @NUM2 minutes of reading a day because they are to busy chating with friends on the @CAPS6. I have a cousin who reads about a book every @NUM3 years and fail every test he gets and has stayed back @NUM4 times, but instead of reading and learning, he is chating and texting. He wastes these excellent educational opportunitys while their are people in underdevolped countries like @LOCATION3 who are lucky to own a book. I know more than @PERCENT2 of the kids in my class do not read anything execpt the required reading and that is because they sit around on the computers wasting @CAPS10 is about @NUM5 and that number is decreasing because of the lack of reading done and the time on computers spent. I have seen survey that say @NUM6 out of @NUM7 spend more than @NUM6 hours a day on computers. These statistics and quotes have left me thinking, how much time do we really need to spend on computers instead of reading or else we will turn into oversized monkey who can't even rad. The computers and @CAPS6 are doing more than just erasing brain cell and are health, they are taking away the expriences that we could have outside in nature. Nature holds natural wonders like the @ORGANIZATION1, the @CAPS11 @CAPS12 and the @CAPS13 @CAPS14. What beats sking down a large slope, or climbing the @LOCATION1, certainly not computers. Unfortunatly, that what most @CAPS15 choose to do. They sit and tap on the keyboard instead of walking nature trails and walking on the beaches. They sit on old moldy chairs and stare at computer screens, unlike the people enjoying the butterfly gardens and wildlife preserves. Instead of taking steps to help the enviorment we are siting on the computers sleeping and being mesmerized by the light of the screen. We should be preserving and learning abouy what is left on the planet, but we are not because of these computes and the @CAPS6. I have present a strong arguement against computers that you @MONTH1 listen to or not. I strongly urge you to take action to start reduce time on computers spent. Set up programs at your house or town for turning off the computers. We need to do something now!",10
163,"Dear @CAPS1, "" Computers are great! They do so much for my family and me, i can't live without a computer."" @CAPS2 my many local in the town of @LOCATION1. For me, computers are a place to have fun with all the different applications. But they can also be used for researching anything you can imagine. I also think tha computer is important because it is where businessmen do their job. My favorite part about the computer are applications like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and so many more. These apps. are great because on @CAPS5, you can talk to your friends if you don't have a cellphone, or talk to friends that live in another state, @CAPS3. Easily my most favorite application, because I get to talk to my friends, look at pictures of them, see who they are dating, and so many other endless possibilities, You can also play and download games onto your computer. It's always very fun to do things on the computer that you enjoy, and not have to research all the time. The second thing on the computer, is research. Researching can be fun and boring, however you look at it, But researching is educational, and I asked a mother with a @NUM1 year old, a @NUM2 year-old, and a @NUM3 yearl-old and she said ""The most important thing to me on the computer is researching. Its's fun, enjoyable, and most importantly, educational!"" The best thing about researching is that, there are endless amounts of websitees that have information for us to look at, and enjoy. People that work and have jobs, are mostly the ones on the computer, and a lot of them ar researching while working. People that work, are th ones that are basically on the computer @NUM4. Businessmen, designers, etc.... The computers are mostly used by workers for e-mail. My father is always on the computer, checking e-mails, typing something for this boss; and even talking on a video conference. There are endless possibilities for workers because foe some of them, computers are their jobs. Computers, in my opinion, they'are one of the best things created. They are the best because they ahve amazing apps. for me to have fun on. But they also provide an educational opportunity through research. And they are great for people with jobs. I don't think there is any person that can live without one of these technological beauties.",9
164,"I would like to state on my behalf that I do not agree that computers are good for society. There are three reasons why I do not agree. Many people will not enjoy the outdoors, @CAPS1 people will spend @CAPS1 there time on the computer, and a lot of people will gain wheight to inactivity. When you sit on a computer you dont get off of for a while, why, because you are haveing fun. when you are haveing fun you will not stop wat you are doing, @CAPS2 dont pay attention. Eventually you will get hooked and play on the computer rather than go outside and have fun with your friends. @CAPS4 will just take up all of your time. @CAPS2 when you are bored you find anything that you can possibly do, rather than be bored. Many people are thinking this is a good time to go on the computer but @CAPS3 you bored you will stay on the computer until you have something to do. My mother always tells me when im bored not stay home because @CAPS4 will get worse. There is always something you can do that dosn't you just have to look harder. My last reason is that when you sit at a computer and you are fingers, you gain your wheight you I read @NUM1 children in every years will be obese, not because @CAPS4 runs in the family but because of inactivity. Inacitivity means not active activity. @CAPS3 you calories you will gain weight @CAPS6 wheight is unhealthy and you can stop the problem by just finding something spend your whole life on the computer. In conclusion you @MONTH1 have mixed thaught's @CAPS3 you ever want to go on the computer all the time. @CAPS4 doesnt matter @CAPS3 you go on just dont all the time. But remember my reasons why not to spend too much time. You will not enjoy the outdoors, find something else to do when you are and you will gain wheight @CAPS3 you spend all your time on the computer. ",8
165,"Dear people that read the news paper and that have @CAPS1 that like to play the computer all day more. Than a hour. I think you should take your time and read my article in this wonderful newspaper. I am writing this article about @CAPS1 using the computer more than an hour. My first reason about this computers issue is it makes than not pay attention in the school. To support that reason so you dont think i am making this up is that they play the computer alot and it makes the @CAPS1 just think about the computer and not think about school. They play it so much and it can mess up the @CAPS1 and they can not focus in school. My second main reason is it makes them allways want to talk about the computer. So if they play it mare than a hour like i said it can cause them to be addicted like drug's it is just like that if you dont want your @CAPS1 to be addicted to drugs i hope you woudnt want your own @CAPS1 to be addicted to the computer. To continue about your @CAPS1 can allways @CAPS2 about the computer it can make your @CAPS1 sound like they have no life because they play it all day everday and I would hope you woudnt want your @CAPS1 to be like this. Most importantly my final reason why you shoudnt let your child play the computer for more than a hour a day. Because they can get over weight. Your @CAPS1 well only get up and go to the bathroom, and eat, they will only do stuff that is in the house. Your @CAPS1 will not go out side and play and they wont get no exerse at all. I hope you will understand where I am coming from I have a brother that is offering in the hospital right computer too much and it messed and the doctor said he make it not so I am praying that he well make it out alive so I hope you woudnt let you @CAPS1 do this it will mess up their life forever. Thank you so much for takeng you own @CAPS4 Time to read this article I hope you would remember this article for your whole ontire life.",8
166,"A lot of people use computers in present day. It allows family and friends to interact with eachother, research places and ideas, and lets you type a document to look neat. On the other hand, computer technology, prevents people from being active, exploring nature, and talking to family and friends in person. I want to explain to you how I feel about computers personally. I can honestly tell you that I love computers. I spend a lot of time on @CAPS3, because it lets me talk to friends I sometimes don't get to see. I can even see how my cousin in @LOCATION1 is doing. Computers also help me out with homework. For projects on a subject that I don't totally understand, I can just hop on my laptop, search what I need, and @CAPS1!, I have my information. Then after that I can type up my report and even pick out a couple of pictures to print out, see? Computer are bangin! But I can understand the other side of the issue. Computers can be time consuming. I can admit that I've spent hours at a time on the computer. This has become a problem. Experts say that people are starting to spend to much time on the computer and less time in the real world. A perfect example is my brother. He loves the @CAPS2. My mom will call him down for dinner and he'll be too engrossed in what he's doing that he will skip the meal. His friends will call him and he'll blow them off until he finishes his game. I agree that people should not spend so much time on computer. You have probably read this and thought to yourself. Well? How does she feel about it? I can honestly say, I was supposed to choose one. But here's the thing. I like my laptop. I'm addicted to @CAPS3, But, I still play sports, I talk to my family, and I even like to take walks through the words or on the beach. I neutral, like @CAPS4 from @CAPS5. Scientist say computers have positive effect on people. Some experts say they're concerned computers have a negative effect on people. @PERSON1 says they are both right. Computers are wonderful. They are one of the most growing technologies in our world. But we don't need to spend @CAPS6 of our time on them. I hope you understand my point on this issue.",9
167,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 stand on this hole computers thing is that it is becoming a big issues because people are spending all there time in books instead of comuitateing with friends and family, exercising, or injoying nature. Just like the expert then tinker siad in his book called @CAPS2 by computers ""To much time on the computers and not the rackemed saven hours outsiad can make you very wnight."" @CAPS3 @CAPS4 why people should get out more is @CAPS5 they can have coumite shion with friends and family.

Another @CAPS4 is that people need more exercis. more the @NUM3 of the leading of the country will be abeast due litle exercise, and that is mostly because of computers.And the last @CAPS4, and the most importint as well, is @CAPS5 people can injoy nature at its fullist, blivie it or not but jack cup thinks @CAPS5 too he said '@PERCENT2 of people how injoy nature will @NUM4 years longer and people now not will likely have a heart in there @NUM5's"" @CAPS5 that is why I think computers are bad for people but it is not just me it is @PERSON1, jackup @CAPS6, sisintsits, and many percentages as well.",7
168,"Dear reader, @ORGANIZATION1 has had a dramatic effect on human life. It has changed the way we do almost everything today. The most well know, is the computer. This device has allowed people do buy things online, talk to people online, and also provides entertainment for some people. All good qualities that make everyones lives easier. Imagine you look into your refrigerator and you notice it's almost empty. Someone is using the car and you need to go grocery shopping and the store is too far. What do you do? Well you could go on a computer and look for food online. Ther are many great deals and some companies even deliver for free! The amazing and easy way to buy food without leaving your house. But food isn't all you can purchase. Many products are sold through the computer. Need new toys for kids? Or how about a new hat for your friend? Maybe even more curtains for your room? Well at the easy access of internet on a computer, you can buy all those items and more. The computer has also the way of communication. Let's say someone wants to talk to a friend or relative that lives far away in another country. @CAPS1 someone dosen't own a phone or @CAPS1 they can't make the call, all these is to be in you on the computer. You can communicate with anyone just by using your email adress. Now friends and families can talk to each other over the ease of the computer. Just type to want to say and ""boom,"" instant, on the chat. Let's face it. No matter what a child or even teenager . But now with a computer all that can change. With just one click you could actually be watching a movie from the comfort of your own home. But what @CAPS1 you don't want a movie? No entertainment like listing to musics, watching fun, and probable the most popular playing games. Everyone loves to play a game every once in a while, and with the selection of thousands of online games, these isn't or person who can't fled atleast our game enjoyable. There are even games for educational fun that many kids love. With all the entertainment a computer can produce; who could hate it? All in all the computer is a revolutinizing device that has changes the way we shop, communicate, and find exciting entertainment. To be able to do so much with just a couple clicks; new that I find extravagant. It blows my mind to see and think, ""@CAPS1 we can do this now, I wonder what we can accomplish in the future.",9
169,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever spent more than an hour at once on the computer? Computers have a negative affect on people! You could be damaging your sight, time should be spent playing outside, and it'll make it harder to talk to people in person. Do your eyes tend to hurt when your finally off the computer? Whether or not you playing games or typing articles your eyes @MONTH1 strain to keep up with a small font on a website. I remember the time when I read an online novel and my whole body was ready to go and play. Except for my eyes. Instead of playing sports games on the computer you should get up and play one outside! When your on a computer, your most-likely indoors. Did you knew a person should be be outside for at least @NUM1 minutes to get there vitamin @CAPS3. Your net sustaining the right amount of vitamins you need daily, at a computer screen. Do you ever find it easier to talk to someone on the computer, than it is in person? Your not the only person that thinks that way. If you get off of the computer and talk to one face to face you can improve your social skills. At first it wont be easy but its worth it in the long run. By now you know that computers aren't really giving off a positive effect. There hurting your vision, limiting your outdoor activity time and making it harder to talk to people in person. So come on put down the mouse down and find something ""hands on"" to do!",8
170,"In our socity computers have a big role. Some people think that this inhaces our socity and benefits the people in the @LOCATION1. Other people think computers are hurting the @CAPS1 citizens. I belive that computers can have our socity into the next and can inhance use to people. Comptores can benifit people by tracking hand-eye coordination give people the ability to learn about the world, and allow people to communicate to others. Computers can teach hand-eye coordination which helps people work with their hands. An arument on the of this is that computers take the place of exercise. For a lot of @CAPS2 a sport is their exercise and in every sport you need hand-eye coordination. Computers don't take the place of they inhance the persons ability to play for exsample to be a goaly in any sport you need fast mentions and good hand-eye coordination. A computer can help the save more goals by increasing their hand-eye coordination. Having good hand-eye coordination can also save you life. If a knife was you human nature world tell you to cover your head with your hands. This would you, if you had hand-eye coordination you away with your body to avoid the knife. Computers help you physically but they can help you mentally as well. Computers can take you around the world without leaving your room. Computers can teach go about culture and life that you didn't even know excisted. The cahan @CAPS1 can not aford the luexury of seeing the world first hand, computers let those people see the world from difient points of veiw. If a student needed to know all about one country they could go on the enternet and get a tour. A student could not go to the country so they went to the second base thing the computer. They can the wanted with one click. Family, friend and coligees are all people you need to talk to. Computers made communication easy for anyone. Now you can talk and see a person in video chat. This benifits socity because if you are talking to a buissness partner you can point to graphs and charts you made. You can also to see a love one that you miss. Their is a different type of comunication for every person. You can e-mail, @CAPS4, instant message, etc. Comunication connects people around the world it a small world after all. Computers have taken our socity in the next level. People can travel the world in a second, talk to anyone and have hand-eye coordination. Computers are growing @LOCATION2 keeping is on top. What would you choose?",10
171,"I think the computer dire a postive effect on people all over the world. You can do lots of things on the computer like an acidemic work, talk on the enernet, or even find out facts' about fam'us people you love, people computer. I think computer can benfit socity becuse computers can help you with your acidimic work, and can also talk to you friends online. One way i can benfit from using the computer by, typing my school work. But when in not doing my school work talking to my friends online. But the best thing of all is finding out information about famuse people like @PERSON1. I rember when is was doing a project on the computer and got a @NUM1 on it becuse i used the computer. That should prove that computers are very help full. Have you ever wondered how a computer can help you in your ever day life. If you said no i can tell you how. You can learn about diffrent places and food. Lets say i was going to make pizza and i did not know how i would have to look on the computer how to. A professor from virgin new york tech school said that with out computers the world is nothing. @PERCENT1 of people at new york tech school agreed but @PERCENT2 did not could you immagin a world with out computers. I if the world did not have computers we would not have cell phones or even t.v. Not ever on know the cell phones or computers lets face it with out computers the world would be lost like the proffser from new york tech said. Also teenagrs would be bored becuse most teenangers do not like to go out side and if we do not have computers how will adults do there work or they will have to handwrite it. Lets be honsest some adults and kids hand writing is like chicken scrach so to say. I think computer are very helpful for everyone around the world. In closing i think the hole world should keep computers becus with out computers the world is lost, to the past paper.",8
172,"I think people should not spend so much time on the computer. This are three reason a think that. My frist reason is if people stay on the computer for a long amount of time it can mess up the way you see. My second reason itis that you could be spending time with family and friends. My last reason is that people that sit all day on a computer gain more weight. First I think people should not be staying on the computer all day. Because it can mess up the way you see this can happen because from u looking at a computer screen all day or eyes can get mess up. I think u should never stay on a computer for no more than a hour. And sometimes u no u been on it for to long when ur eyes started to hurt. My second reason u should not stay on the computer for a long time is because when u are secting there. Doing wat you are doing. You can be messing out on fun thing that u can be doing with ur family our with friends. But some people would just like to sect all day end look at a computer screen and some people start not to like going out our even beeging a social person. My last reason people should not be on the computer for a long time because some people will just seat there and eat food all day. And this will make them get more weight. And this can make there life wader because now they are on heelthy they are just seating down all day anyways. And they should be going outside end running around. This are my three reason I think people should not stay on the computer all day. One it mess up they way u see, second you are messing out on fun thing u can do with our family, end last people are graning more weight when seat on the computer all day.",7
173,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, To begin, I understand that people don't like computers because they are over used. If the computers are so bad then they shouldn't be used, but how I see it is that they also bring more good than bad. These points to computer wellfare are they bring sourses, their is interaction between people, and computers are going to advance more over time. Even though these people think they are overused they still use them. So, even I use the computer a lot, but it could be used for good. First and foremost, these computers can get sources online that can't be found in books. Their are search engines that you can find your topics on. Then, when you find your source it has info that could have been skipped over. They can show the other side of they story that they didn't say in the book. your projects that you used to have to go to the library for you now can do from home, that itself is a step that you aren't considering. For instance if people are on a lot @PERCENT1 of the time is research. Furthermore, people can interact with friends over the computer. They can talk, send pictures, or play games. For example, i play xbox and I talk to my friends over that a lot of the time. Even a video game is fun as being with them, quoted from @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ""I have a computer not for friends, but for work"". This shows that even large important still use it for work. people say using a computer is like learning to ride a bike. My mom told me a story that she met my dad because he fixed her computer at her job. So, I am here with my parents because of a computer. None the less, the computers are at their begining and they will further improve. So people that are on have a reason for why they are on the computer. This advancement is going to advance again and again so there won't be a way to stop it thus, people will be on it only more and more so there is no chance of stopping the outbreak of computers. Then you will try to stop them with ""computers eat your brain"". We all know that is garbage. To conclude, I implore you not to try and change the habits of others. I @CAPS3 that if people want to use computer they can. I say this with the sources, the friends and the advanement.",8
174,"Dear Local @CAPS1: I'm sitting at the couch thinking about what I should do for vacation. I know I definitely want to take a trip somewhere to do same creative writing, but my notebooks are all scattered, I don't know how to quickly contact someone who could help and I have no idea about the country that I plan to visit. I take a last look at my notebooks strewn about the closet looking very much like a tornado swept through and I find solution on the highest shelf my laptop. First, I highly agree with the people who think computers are useful. Three effects they have on people who use them usely are fantastic. Compare a person with a laptop to one without. The person with a laptop @MONTH1 be a busy business person and have to converse with many people from long distances a part, so they use e'mail and @ORGANIZATION1. They travel places with people at their fingertips. However a person without a laptop could be busy moving from place to place just to meet these people. Their schedule could be chaotic. Conversations over a chat system are fast and effective. Take my story for example. My mom hates wasting, so instead of me driving to a friend we @CAPS2. Saves money and time! In addition, I happen to be a writer who write often everyday in many notebooks. I've written so much over the years that my notebooks are piling all over my room. What organizational tool could help me in this situation? Why a laptop of course! One laptop or computer store a bunch of and editing a breeze. Anyone who with data and writing would be crazy not to have a computer! What you a room notebooks that you buy of, or a single, computer with tons of space and back up? You tell me. Computers encourage users to be more organized! Respectively, computers are resource for a millions of pages information. They're similar to libraries. But think about a library and then imagine a computer. One you have to walk around to seek your information and with the other, knowledge is merely a click away. Some @MONTH1 argue that computer websites are not entirely reliable I beg to differ. There are specific websites on computers with suffixes like '.org' and'.gov' and even'.edu'. These websites contain proven factual information and more great resources for research. By using computers I have acquired greater knowledge and have found computers beneficial. They have effectively made me more intellgent as a person. In conclusion, it's my strong opinion that those who use computers gain nothing but the positive effects, and these include money/gas-saving conversations through @CAPS2 and email organization and increased intelligence from reading. I've decide to take my creative writing on my laptop and in doing so learned the storm.",11
175,My opinion on the effects computer have on people. A good effect that computer have on people that it teaches them how to have good hand-eye coordination @CAPS1 if they work as a doctor on anything that needs it that would help them do better in their jobs. Another reason why computers have good effects on people it let them chat with their famile memebers case if your family went to a whole new countries for a trip then you beable to see how there doing and it's like there. Another one would be that you could learn about another states and countries around the world.  It tell you how many people like there and what type of culture they have when it found probably now when I want to learn about texas I look up information on it and tell me when it was found the capital and how many people live there. Another good thing that you could play games with your friends like all types shooting games racing sport arcade all type.,6
176,"Dear Local Newspaper, I have been using my computer for a long time now. I didn't have one growing up, but I got one last year. Ther has been people saying tht the computer is good and it helps you stay in contact with friends and family it helps you learn about everything and you can look up the news. I totally agree with this. But some people don't like the computer because they spend more time on it then going outside. Here are ny thoughts on the computer. First of all, teh computer is a great way to look up the news. You can find more news and weather faster then you can on teh television. if you want to find the news, just got to awebsite that you think has news. I am find out what weather is today, what happens throughout the day that @MONTH1 be shocking to everyone, and find out about celebrities. All this at a push of a button, and a click of the mouse. Secondly, the computer is like a tutor. Either your having trouble on homework, or you just want to knoe a simple fact, the computer is for you. Just search up soemthing you want to know on a search engine and you will have your answer. This amy not seen that important, but it is when you are anxious to learn. Lastly, the computer is the famous way of communicating around the globe. Whether it's facebook, myspace, aim, you can tlak to your distant or close family and friends. You might think, ""oh tha's what a phone is for""? Well all of these websites are free. Yeah, I said it free. There is also skype. Skype is where you can actually see the person you are talking to. Yes, the wonderful world of technology. So now you know that a computer can teach you things. it can find you news, and it can help you communicate across the globe. Now your thinking, ""People spend too much time on the computers right""? This is where independnece comes in. Get off or it. it's your decision to stay on it, not the computers. Limit your time to a half hour a day. Go ourside, enjoy nature. AMybe do a little excercise. ",8
177,"Dear local newspaper, Computers are a usefull tool when doing a school report or something to that effect but, @CAPS2 we really need thoes computers. When using a computer for a school project @CAPS3 can be a hassel. One of many problems people are fased with while using a computer are freazing, when doing a project and your computer frezz's @CAPS3 can be verry time consumming. Another problem is pop up's, pop up's can couse virouses, and when you computer gets a virous, @CAPS3 leads to becoming very slow. Witch leads us to are next problem slowness, when a computer becomes slow @CAPS3 is verry a digital. There are several problems and risks that come with a computer. One health problem is that you can become a hermet and stay inside all day because your too attached to the computer. Another problem is that you can become verry obease because your not getting any physical exersise. One risks of using a computer is that you could end up getting an fassebook, @CAPS1, or myspase, and meating some one who is protending to be some one there not and get abducted by a molester! There are other alternations you could make instead of using an computer. One alternation is that you could go to the local library and cheak out books on your topick that your wanting information on. Another alternation is to ask teachor if she/he could leand you a class text book. But the main aternation is computer to old fashon books! So now @CAPS3's your choice,""@CAPS2 we realy need computers or can we live with out them?"" @CAPS3's your choice!",8
178,"Dear, local Newspaper @CAPS1 I read the article and I think that you guys are right because in the @DATE1 kids rather stay inside on the computer. @CAPS1 who know's what they do @CAPS1 some kids are on facebook all day some are on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3. Sometimes kids dont even like to go do exercises they stay on the computer eating & eating. I think if their was no technology kids these days wont be beast. Some kids dont even like hanging out with their friends or family they say that they want to stay home on the computer but we should do more, exercises than being on the computer. If were always on the computer we wont learn nothing at school because when were at school kids could be thinking about going home to go on the computer and you wont focused on our education @CAPS1. And what if kids drop out or dont come to school anymore because they to be chatting with their friends or a stranger. What if a girl didn't want to go to school and on her computer. What if she is talking to a stranger computers so kids can just go and do some exersis instead of being on the computer and wont be a beast anymore.",8
179,"I believe that people spend too much time on the computers. If people spend hours on the computer it will result in bad eye sight. They don’t get enough exercise.most teens aren't getting home work done because of this @CAPS1 people sit on the computer for countless hours their eye sight is slowly going bad. The bright lights of the screen make your eyes unclear state say more people lose eyesight from looking of a computer than they would by staring at a light. Sitting down in front of the screen you aren't down in front of the screen you arents getting any exercise. You mostly just move your hands and fingers. If people dont exercise for at least @NUM1 minutes a day, we will all become week. Lastly, your teenager probably do their homework. while they are in his or her room they've most likely all the computers. if they spend too much time on the computer they are more likely to fail their classes. which means they will most likely stay back. In other words, people spend too much time on the computer. If we continue this most people will lose eye sight. if citizens keep sitting there then we will became unhealthy. And lastly, more teens want do homework and wont succeed.",7
180,"Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 I think that computers are a good thing to use. I know that some people do use the computer instead of enjoying a or exercising, but not everyone does that, The computer is a good resource to invest time in. The effects computers have on people is good (for the most part). The statement is true, people that use the computer can talk with people online and get information quickly than the library. I believe that the effects a computer has on a person, are good effects. When people use a computer they can get information which for research and work (word) That's because, when your on a computer you can simply relax but get available amount of work done. You can also do things while your on the computer, hold your dog, hold your cat, eat, drink, text, call. It's very multi propose (use). But some computers is a bad thing because not how the very expensive and same dont have the money to buy a computer but if you do have, you because they're of people or example @CAPS4 cheated and not a computer he could have good so rich and rumors because the computer is what he needs to be succesful with microsoft so computers are useful and the effect they have on people is a positive one.",7
181,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 the years computers have gotten faster smaller smarter, these advances have led to mankind as we know it advancing, but the effects that come with @MONTH1 be non profitable to the youth of the computer world. Some common effects computers have on people, mostly children are, preventing kids to play outside, tbe active, computers prevent people from using their immagination they also are a waste of time. Everyday a child across america will use the same old exuse, ""no mom, im not on facebook, im doing my @CAPS4 report"", while infact they haven't even started it, or they hours ago are now goofing around on line, but ask your self. ""did this happen thirty years ago? no your parents who grew up then were thrilled to an outside when thire assignments were compleated. They could not wait to get on that flaming red bike t go play ball with joey. Kids these days are becoming less active t egar to play outside f people blame obbisity on genetics while it probbly should be blamed on computers, sucking children to them. Because kids never want to leave the side of their beloved computer to go outside they are using less + less of their immagination. parents tell storys of when they would watch the one new episode of their favorite show + what whole week the kids in the neighborhood would take roles + act it out. but do you see that every day in this generation not at all. No one that or imaginn any thing new about it with friends to make it more fun they only move onto the wii five minuets later to play a smashing ballons game. Computers just up all of your time the average kid will spend up to four hours on the computer just falling around with no purpose. Wasting the time they could be improving homework or walking the dog the time is not bring donated to a good source. it is not being effective most times. they say computers are the now generation but dose that mean that the now generation must be, lazy, unimmaginitive, and not care what their time is put towards. Most people will say no we are not but you offer a nine year old to play on the computer or, oh say go outside! You would be ignorant to think they would go out to play. People want to move forward but can we not make a compromise?",9
182,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1't you agree that computers should be limited or often not used? Recently, it has been brought to my attention that computers have a negative effect on society. Without a doubt, I firmly believe that computers should be a hobby not an addiction. People spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising and interacting with family and friends. Most teenagers are involved with cyber-bullying which takes place on computers. People spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising. I can remember when my step mom @PERSON1 was a size six in the waist. @PERSON1 would exercise everyday after work for two hours. This all changed when my dad bought her a lime green, @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 laptop for her birthday. @PERSON1 quickly became addicted to @CAPS3 (computer game) and began to cut down on her exercising routines. Six months later, when she went to a doctor's appointment she found out that she gained more than ten pounds. @PERSON1 is now a size fourteen in waist. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people gain weight because they cut down on exercising so they can have more computer time. Most people spend to much time on their computers and less time interacting with family and friends. This reminds me of my step dad @PERSON4. When @PERSON4 gets home from work he usually goes straight to the computer instead of having a conversation with the rest of the family. He gets angry when @PERSON2 (@NUM1 years old) bothers him because he wants to play. @PERSON4 is usually online. From three o'clock till ten o'clock playing chess with strangers from all over. What he doesn't know is that while he is building relationships with strangers he is breaking the bond between him and his loved ones. @PERCENT2 of teenagers are involved with cyber bullying. This reminds me of my cousin @PERSON3. Last @DATE1, @PERSON3 became a member of @CAPS4 @CAPS2, iTrouble quickly began to find her. In other words, girls from ages thirteen to twenty began to send her threatening messangers. No later than a day when @PERSON3 was walking down the street a gang of girls jumped her. However, she survived the brutal attack and deleted her @CAPS4 account. In conclusion, without a doubt, I firmly believe that people shouldn't spend to much time on computers. My three arguments are cyber-bullying, less exercise and less interaction with family and friends, @CAPS7 take my suggestion seriously and bann computers.",9
183,"Computers are an amazing technology to life. It'@CAPS1 amazing because the computer helps lots of people and jobs. The people it helps are kids in school to look up an area they need to find for a question on a worksheet. Also the jobs it helps us the police, @CAPS1.W.A.T and the @ORGANIZATION1. It helps the police and @CAPS1.W.A.T to find where people are and where they'll be. The @ORGANIZATION1 uses computers to locate where they will attack or defend. if it wasn't for computers we wouldn't of found @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The bad thing about computers are hackers and people that wont get off their computers. They are obssesed with the computer and they are so obssesed they sleep with the computer. That'@CAPS1 the parents fault. Those are the only bad things about computers. They get people fat an lazy because they only want to be on the computer. The computer also has good ways to reconnect with family and friends over the years you haven't seen them. The computer controlls lots of things like the nuclear bomb, security, secret-files, satalites, all of @CAPS5.A.@CAPS1.A. and more. They control life in the major part. People shouldn't be concerned about kids that sit there next to a computer all day because it'@CAPS1 the person'@CAPS1 fault, they ruined their lifes and the parent'@CAPS1 fault manly for not controlling their kid with staying away from the computer or the parents not signing them up for any sport. It ruines their life by having no friends at school an all they do is go straight for the computer. It'@CAPS1 an ashame to the father that use to be the cool kid, make fun of the nerds and get into fights every month. Then the father looks at his son an relises his son is a nerd and lives by a computer, then the father tryes to help the son and somewhat works out. Then the father keeps trying, thats good parenting to try to step it right when the child starts to go straight to the computer. Not the other parents that let their son/daughter only use the computer. Those are my opinions on computers of the good an bad ideas.",8
184,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am writing this letter to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people. And there are three of them: @CAPS4 theft, cyberbully, addition. Now I will write one paragraph about each. My first reason why I feel that computers have bad effects is. @CAPS4 theft many people in the @CAPS5.S.A identities get stolen for listing private information online (computer) which can leave that person in a lot of debt. How are we going to encourage people to use computers when their at the risk of getting their @CAPS4 stolen. If this happening to innocent people it needs to stop we must'nt encourage this online behavior so say no to computers. i understand it really is interesting to learn about people from different countries but their are some cons. Talking online to people you don't know and have never seen, met in person they can pose as someone famous and bully you for their enjoyment. It has been proven that when children even adults get cyberbullied can lead them in the path of depression even suicide. Now I find it quite febble-minded to give up your life for a computer. So again I say no to computers. My last reason why I say no to computers is because people become addicted to the excitement of the computers when eventually lead to the division from friends and family because your lost in the computer world also you forget about you hygene some people even forget to eat. This thing they call computer is a drug, a drug that makes you forget about reality and everything else you used to think of and bring you to computer land. And I say no to computers. I have gave you my opinion and three supporting reasons why I feel the way I do which were because @CAPS4 theft, cyberbullying, addiction. Say no @NUM1 computers.",8
185,"Dear, Newspaper I am writing to persuade to put article in the paper about how computers have bad benefits on people. Computers make you unhealthy, bullying takes place on the computer, and it effects how you do in school. First, computers have bad effects on people because it makes you unhealthy. I say this because most people don't get enough exercise. Then you get obese from not having enoughb exercise. Eventually you @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not get diabetes from being obese, but most of the time you do. The next reason why lcomputer have bad effects is because kids get bullied on the internet. This is important because when kids get bullied the feel bad about themselves. Then they all get very depressed. This is called cyber bullying. One example is, is that a guy came to our school to talk about his son. his son had killed himself from being bullied on the internent and at school. That is why bullying is an important issue and computers have bad effects on people. My third and final reason why computer have bad effects on people is that kids do bad in school. they do bad in school because they spend so much time on the computer that they stop doing their homework and stop preparing for tests and quizzes. Also kids get distracted in school because all they think or care about is going home and going on the computer. Kids also do bad in school because they eventually think that school is a waste of time and drop out. It is a proven fact that @PERCENT1 of kids that have dropped out of school was kids that were always on the computer and they said that school was a waste of time. Thats how a computers have on effect on school. Now remember, computers have bad effects on people because it makes people unhealthy. People gets bullied, and it has on effect on your schoolwork. That is how computers have bad effects on people.",8
186,"Dear @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1, I am a @ORGANIZATION2 student and I hear that some people think it is good to use computers and others think that its a waist of time. Well I have @NUM1 good reasons as to why computers are good technology. One reason is you can book places that you want to go or the sights you want to see. This is a good way to use the computer because you can track your route you can even print a map and go hiking. (hows that for excersing). Another reason why computers are good to use is because of online chats. Let's say that you have a family member that lives all the way out in @LOCATION1 and they have a computer and you want to talk to them but it costs you to talk, you can e-mail. This is a good way to use the computer because you can stay updated on what is going on with your family members. Another reason is learning. You can learn about many different cultures. You can learn about different people and how they live their life and ther cultures. My last reason is the @CAPS1. This is a great way to use the computer because you can keep updated on the lafest things like the earthquake in hati; or a hurricane or a @CAPS1 breaking story. Or if their is a storm headey your way. In conclusion, using the computer has great ways to be used and sure people, put some bad sights out their but if you use it the right way it is a good source of technology!",8
187,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers and other technology are the best thing that ever happened to the world! I hear that computers effect people, well I don’t agree with that statement. Here are my @NUM1 reasons why. Computers and other technology make the way easier. Talking to family and friends without spending money. If you control the amount of time you use on a computer then you will be fine. Please keep reading to hear my great ideas. To start off, computers and other technology make life easier. Think about it we have access to our bank accounts, stores, reasearch, school, etc. See instead of having to go at shoppingfor food you could just order it online with no trouble. We can now shop @CAPS4 cloths and other household items. It'so easy just to look at a list and pick what you want instead of waiting in a long line. @CAPS4 example, I went to @CAPS1 to pick up a few items @CAPS4 a party. There a long line, so I just got online picked what i wanted and had it shipped to me unless then @NUM2 hours! Its cool to not have to even got up to get what you want. I know you sometimes have your since you don't wanna get up? But you have to go shopping. Doesn't computers make life so easy. Secondly, talk to family and friends without having to spend money. This is awesome because you can text, video chat, email @CAPS4 free. Computers have so many websites to talk to your family and friends like, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, myspace, yahoo, and even ohvoo. Mostly, all those you can video chat and voice chat @CAPS4 free. All of those sites you can text @CAPS4 free and touch those with your @CAPS4 example, one day I didn't want spend my to talk to my friend. So I just video chatted with them. And it was @NUM3 times better and free and better. Even @CAPS4 people long distanceis way to much money in call them. So why not just video chat I know you wouldn't wanna spend hundreds of dollars @CAPS4 a phone call bill! Please keep reading. Thirdly, if you count he amount of time you use on he computer of other technology devices then you will be fine. If you limit and set a time on the use of your computer everything will be wonderful. You can tell your body to get off the pc and get a work out or talk to friends. There's no way you could be addicted to something if you have a limited @CAPS4 it. If your the type of person that is a at something. Then @MONTH1 be you shouldn't get a computer. Like my mom gives me a limited @CAPS4 the computer @NUM4 my laptop has to be off on a school night. An @NUM3:00pm my laptop has to be off on the weekends. There's alway ways to not to be addicted. You just have to know when enough is enough. Its not the computers fault. Just have to control yourself. To wrap this up I would just like to say thank you @CAPS4 having the time to read my letter. My reasons are, computers make life easier, talk to family and friends @CAPS4 free, and if you control the amount of time you use on a computer than you will be fine. Thanks again.",8
188,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the fact of the computer is that it can be bad for the citizens in @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. I think that some people are not getting enough exercise and I also think that you can get lazy on the computer is bad too. @CAPS1 three reasons for @CAPS1 opinion is @NUM1. People are not getting enough exercise, @NUM2. People get lazy and changes while being on the computer an mount of time, @NUM3. They will get addicted to the computer. The first reason is because people are not getting enough exercise I pick that reason because people I know gain a lot of weight and it's kinda of sad because they do nothing but stay on the computer and eat. Another detail is that the computer messes up your eyes by staring at that type of screen. One time I did that and @CAPS1 eyes felt weird after getting on the computer. The third detail was that people gets very fragile and weak. I picked that detail because if you get up off the computer and exercise your bones will become weak. The second reason is because people will become lazy and changes for an example people will keep asking you to get stuff and do stuff for them and you would do it because you be a good friend. The second detail is that the person will change, the person will be lazy to go to fun events with you as a freind. The next thing you you wont have a freind anymore. The third detail is that it's like your bestfriend has replaced you for a computer that hurts if a person you know for a long time has replaced you for a computer thats something that will make you depressed and make you wanna commit suicide too me anyways. The third reason is because the person will get addicted to the computer for an example you want to celebrate a birthday and the person says ""first I got to beat this level."" @CAPS2 the person saying that the person is not going to get off the computer. Another detail is that his day will go pass fast and thats like waisting days of life and people who died will do anything to get their life and to waist is not good. The third detail is you will began to hate the person because the person dosen't care about anything but the computer. Those were the reasons to explain @CAPS1 opinion on the compter fact in the news paper I read.",8
189,"Dear, local newspaper, Some people are starting to belive that the computers are effecting people @CAPS1 also on that side because some people would stay on it all day, get edictded to it and want do nuthing all day. First reason why computers are effecting people because some people would study on it all day some people when get homw from school or wry they go right on the computer. They would stay on from @NUM1 to @NUM2 at night on the computer and do it nthe next day. Another reasons why computer are effecting people edictded to it because there off all those freind, plus when think on the computer things final reason computer people siting computer. So those are reasons are stay on some edictded do anything.",7
190,"Dear @CAPS1 I think more and more people use computers because it can help you find a job if you lost it. Because right now some job are going bank ruded. And parants can not help because they didn't have job to support there love ones. Another thing is that cars are going up on prices so if you don't have a lot of money you can go online and get a car and truck for great prices. And it can help you save a lot of money in your pocet. For some reason @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people like to go to far away places for example @CAPS2, put or @LOCATION1, @CAPS3. And you if go to these place then you would need place to stay and have a good meal with your family or friends. So you would need a nice pleasant holetitle which will have awsome food, beds, pools and more thing people like to do when they is on vaction. And for example if your mother or father what you to go to your public school but you don't what too because you heared something or about the school say because you cant find great school online for example @CAPS4, cap pre, classicle, brizzal, And some other school are the best to and fun to go to and be succesful with your life. Now you know why more and more people use computers and you should always use technology and it would help you on the hand eye giving people the ability to learn about use computers.",8
191,"Dear newspaper editor, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 have and use computers everyday. Computers are killing us as a nation. We need to put a stop to this abuse of computers. Millions of parents and kids spend at least @NUM1 minutes a day on the computer. They are either working or playing. There are many @CAPS2 games and other types of games out on the internet. Kids use these as entertainment. But having an @NUM2 year old child playing a game with guns is certainly unnacceptable. Kids often get so caught up in playing these addictive games that they don't even think of playing sports or going outside. Therefore, the child loses much needed exercise and fresh air. This can lead to obesity or other weight issues. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 are already obese, so why keep these horrid games out there? The last thing @LOCATION1 needs is more kids becoming fat!! There are two ways to use a computer for good and for bad ways to use them for good can be for planning a vacation, or working at a job, or even to look at a child's grades online. But many kids and parents don't use computers for these reasons. Kids have been caught looking at porn, buying illegal drugs, hacking into systems and other criminal type things. The computer is a way to do things that you shouldn't, while keeping your identity hidden. For example, whever I sign-up for a website subscription so I can play a game, it asks me for personal information. It askes for my name, my address, my phone number and other things. So what my mother has taught me to do is to use false info. So a computer hacker or a fraud site can't steal my personal info. And who are we to know that people don't do this with illegal programs? Computers are dangerous to @LOCATION1's well-being. On top of obesity, there have been reported cases of a child or parent having a seizure, having the picture of a game implanted in their eyes because they don't take their eyes of the game. There has even been a case of where a chid went mad and killed his/her parents in rage. Computers turn kids and parents into wild beasts. Parents commonly try to get their children to stop playing certain games. In some cases, the parent destroys an account on a website or takes a computer away for a certain ammount of time. These actions from parents have caused kids to go mentally insane! Cases have been reported of smashing computers, doing bad in school, killing parents as I said earlier and in some cases suicide. So in conclusion, computers are a source of health issues, action issues and mental issues. If we want @LOCATION1 to be restored to the @LOCATION1 we all love, then we the people, must put a stop to this computer addiction!",10
192,"Computers are progressing into our lives more and more. These machines help our world become an easier place to do. work, pay bills and even entertain ourselfs. @CAPS3, these things are weighed down by the negative effects like the online dangers, increasing  to reality, and the obesity problems we face. With our new advances people are spending more time sitting around than being outside, which udds more and more to obesity problem we face. Kids and teens today would much rather be on their @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 account, than go for a run or shoot some hopps. Also, more and more ads are on the web for unhealthy foods making these kids more likely to eat more junkfood. Finally, the internet fools people into believing they can go on easy diet eat. and become skinny with no worries. Along with more computers and users comes increasing dangers and threats. Viruses can hack you computer, steal you personal info and destroy you computer. You can have huge bills for things you didn't even buy! Cyber bullies are also a new and dangerous threat!. These people threaten and taught inosent people. I remember a story of a girl who took her own life because she was bullied by someone who turned out to be another girl and her mother. Finally, online predators are a great threat to teens. These people brain wash people, convince them to meet, and rape and kill them. Last but not least todays computers interaction with young minds increases ignorance with ads, and negleck of education and reading. Many kids even myself would rather be online than read a book or do homework. @CAPS3, computer can take over some people's likes, they will neglect school and other important things like homework or studing credting weaker minds for out future. Also, ads and website with false information can fall down our youth even more with ignorance and ignorant belifs. Finally, kids computer interaction can cause belites like ""you shout vote for @PERSON1 because he is black"" or other racist and ignorant statements. Computers help our advance in bettering the world and our understanding of our world, @CAPS3, certain aspects can create ignorance and danger for people yound and old, and their minds.",9
193,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has been a lot of discusion of whether computers effect people in a positive way or in a negative way. I believe that computers effect most people negatively. I think this because people lose their people skills"" by talking through the computer, computers @MONTH1 also lead to danger, and because people tend to forget about their priorities in life. From what i know. most people that use computers use them to talk to friends and other people around the world. Instead of hangingout with their friends they talk through the computer and if that what they do, more than hanging in person then they won't reconize the facial expressions given to them by certin people, while talking in person you get the full on experience of communicating with them. You get the tome of voide in addition to the facial expressions. You also get the body language which you can't get from on the computer unless you are using webcam. Computers have led to many dangers. These dangers effect every user and their families. @CAPS1 have been many cases of young teenagers being tricked by ader users into showing them parts of their body to making the teens believe that the older user can relate to their problems and are the same age. sometime the teen is persuade to leave their home and neighbor hood to meet the other user. Also, another type of danger is cyberbulling. Cybe bulles lower yourself-esteem. The bullies call you names and pick on you and sometimes make you feel suicidal. If we hadnt had any computer then none of these dangers would be occuring. With computers people have lost their judgement in top priorites. Some computers uses tend to forget about the important things in life such as family, schools work, and their own health. Some people would rather stay on the computer than hangout with family and friends. Others tend to choose not to do their homework and work on their social life on the computer instead. Since they are on the computer alot they seem to ignore their health. They don't exercise as much and don't eat as healthy. So in my opinion, life without computers would be good for everyone. People would still have the people skills they had before, their wouldn't be as much danger, and people would focus more on the important thins than their online social lives.""",10
194,"Dear Newspaper I think that computers were one @ORGANIZATION1 the best things ever created. They allow you to talk to people in far away places, help you learn about career and education choises, and you are able to learn about many subjects. Computers are here to help society not hurt it so why shouldn'y we use them? With @CAPS5 we can talk to people around the world or in space @CAPS2 that matter. You might not know it hut all @ORGANIZATION1 the communications in the world need a @CAPS5. There not the kind anyone could go out and but though. There satalites, the orbit the planet from space, @PERSON1, a proffesor at @ORGANIZATION1, told students at @ORGANIZATION3 that, ""A lot @ORGANIZATION1 every day items, such as rars and phones, all use some kind @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS5."" @CAPS1 computers let people communicate with each other. In addition to letting people communicate they help millions @ORGANIZATION1 people make educational and career choises. Most kids that go to college don't know a lot @ORGANIZATION1 colleges out there. When my sister was picking what college she wanted to go to she didn't know which one to choose. She sat down and looked up hundred @ORGANIZATION1 schools. after narrowing it down she had made her decision she had picked @ORGANIZATION4, a @ORGANIZATION3 she had never even heard @ORGANIZATION1 a couple months ago. People are in this type @ORGANIZATION1 situation all the time at @ORGANIZATION2 a survey was taken by all the students to see what they wanted their career to be, @CAPS2 the rest @ORGANIZATION1 the week students got to experience diffrent carrer options. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 the students picked a different carrer after that one week. Have you ever heard the old aget ""@CAPS3 is power""? well its true and computers are a great source @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3. they have many different subjects math, science, history language and much much more. people should be using this @CAPS3 at the @CAPS4 francisco national debate @PERSON2. Said that ""@CAPS5 are a great tool when used properly this includes looking up new places math. and even comunicating these are what computers should be used @CAPS2 not unhealthy games. You can learn about many new places with a @CAPS5. In @NUM1 grade my teacher had everyone do areport on a country me and my friend found this place we had both never heard @ORGANIZATION1. with the @CAPS5 we found onts @ORGANIZATION1 information on it such us its main income, exports, resorts, and fun activities. After reading all the facts surely one would agree that a @CAPS5 is a great tool that should be used. It lots people communicate, helps in educational decisions, and you can learn many subjects such as math, science, and language. I strongly believe that all people should use a @CAPS5.",9
195,"Dear Local @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 I see why some people think that computers and technology are bad for society, I on the other hand strongly disagree with them. In my eyes technology, especially computers can bring people together and computers are very benificial to @CAPS5. Also computers can save you time and money now. First off computers can bring people together. I had one of my best friends move across the country, all the way to @LOCATION1! and I don't get to see her so I now video chat with her on my laptop. and if I didn't have that opportunity then we probably wouldn't have stayed in touch with each other. That experience was not only with a friend but it happened with a family member as well, my grandmother. Every year for passover the whole family comes to house to celebrate but because she is getting older we video chat so she can see the whole family together. It is wonderful experience. As I said before computers can be benifical to @CAPS5. You might be thinking ""@CAPS3 it can only understand that but I am a student at @ORGANIZATION1 and sometimes I forget to write an assignment down so I get my laptop and go to @ORGANIZATION1 notes. com, if that was have gotten a zero on the homework. See! Computers are very benifical! Have you ever been in a situation where you need something but you just don't have time? Well now many things can be ordered offline. You can get things from food to cloths and toys. Surveys have proven that over @PERCENT1 of average @CAPS4 order off of the computer and save money from gas because they don't have to drive. Overall, I think computers can be handy and helpful to all ages, @CAPS5 with homeworks, family and friends and adults who don't have a lot of time. And I think as years go by more and more people will start to realize that.",8
196,"@ORGANIZATION1, ore and more people use computers @DATE1, but this is not necessarily a good thing. Spendign too mcuh time on computers affects your activity level. Also. Kids are now staying up later on the compute, in turn lowering grades. Finally, spending too much time on the computer decrease the amount of time spent with friends and family. Firstly, spending too much time on the computer affects your activity level. The more time spent has on a computer, the less time a person has to do something active, like exercising @PERCENT1 of people spend more than @NUM1 @NUM2 hours on the computer per day, if @NUM3 or so hours were used to exercise or play a sport that number would decrease to @PERCENT2 according to a recent study. Doctors have said that at least @PERCENT3 of overweight parents spend most o ftheir time on the computer, thus limiting their time exercising. The amount of spent on the computer has been shown to decrease activity level and effect the number of overweight and obese people everywhere. If we want to become a healthier country, we should state @CAPS5 writing time spent on computers. Also kids now stay up later on computers and lower then grades @CAPS5 doing so. More time spent on @CAPS1 or anywhere on the @CAPS2 means less time studying, which means lower grades. Kids in spent an average of @NUM3 @NUM2 hours on the computer each day, while kids spend @NUM6 @NUM2 hours each day. A student in @PERSON2 saw their grades improve from a @CAPS3+ to a @CAPS4+ just @CAPS5 spending less time on the computer and more. That studnet also felt more because they get more computer. This tests and quizzes. Computers clearly negative effect on grades and school work. Finally, computers limit the amount of time spent with family nd friends. A student, @PERSON1, said that she, spent more time going out with friends now that computer isn't up all my time, @CAPS5 doing this, i have a better friendshhip with all my friends than before. ""A kid that uses the computer during all of the free time spends @PERCENT4 less time with friends than someone who usues it in moderation. Afmilies also suffer from this a swell. If a family member spends all their time on the computer, the other family members will have less of a relationship with them because they don't talk or do anything together an dwill likely not know what is going on i their life or if something is wrong. As you can tell, computers also have a negative effect on relationships with family and friends. The overuse of computers does nnot benefit society. They affect a persons activity level, students grades and most importantly a persons realtionships with family and friends. In oredr to ake our country a better and healthier place, we must the time spent on computers.""",12
197,"To the Newspaper, Computers are obviously needed in society. They can be used as a valuable learning tool, help communication, and teach skills that will be used for life. Students like myself of often use computers for many reasons. Our teacher also encourage us to use computers. All projects require research. For example, last week in social students I researched the amendments to the constitution. I went to @ORGANIZATION1- on the and sound a storage of information on the @NUM1 for my project on wehter capital punishment is and unusual. I found from this database that not onlt is it all lawed for that reason but the @LOCATION1 got from the international council of human rights for allowing it. Without the internet, which is instanly to carry the newest. most recent information I would have now to go find banks published recently enough carry this significant fact. It would mre costly taken over two houses just to find the same information that five minutes using a computer. The internet can millions websites and photo on a wide variety of toys and faster than any other method. As well as for research, school use computers to type papers. This moves than easier to road the teacher and provides useful tools like spell check. Also, using the internet you can access all of the communicate benefits of using computers. E-mail, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are just @NUM2 of the commnly used websites on computers they make talking to friends and family easier and faster then ever. Last @DATE1 my friend on a business trip the was for @NUM3 weeks she missed him a lot @CAPS4 mom let @CAPS4 she was able to would have a telephone call. It consoled @CAPS4 for the @NUM4 days wasn't able to see @CAPS4 while still being amazing quick. Computers allow people to interact with other people at once even when they can't be with that person for whatever reason. This communication element is very important just like how they will help for the future. Many jobs involve the usage of a computer mastering how to use the computer before. It is needed has many advantages. If we already know how to use them we don't need to worry about learning in life. Also in the closer future computer will be used in high school and college for helping paper researching and morw it will be faster and easier for us it we have knowledge of how to do these things. Eventualy if can read the benefits are counters. As you can see, computers and the internet can any benefits iur society school can use them for many projects and learning People can talk to others virtually when it is not possible face to face finally, it can help run the future. In conclusion compare use be encouraged.",11
198,"Dear, local newspaper I agree with @CAPS1 that computers are not good because of different reasons such as putting a person's health in danger for not excersicing much or making people spend more time on a computer than interact with family & friends and sadly also it causes people to change there attitudes and ways of being. But if you wanna hear more than you will just have to read on. There are plenty consequences that people have for spending too much time on the computer, such as people getting addicted to watching certain things or addicted to watching certain things or simply get addicted to the computer itself. Plenty of people now a days, have to wear glasses and probably most of them have to wear them because of too much computer, and it must be really bad having to wear glasses the rest of your life. Also too much computer is bad for a person's health because they're giving more time to a computer than spending that time excercising. I believe people should spend more time interacting with family & friends because it can also make you lose your friends and/or family because your not giving them the time they need & friends and family are one of the most important things in a person's life. And last but not least. too much computer can change a person such as changing their manners, the way they speak, and there attitides. Well I've giving you reasons why I think computers are not good such as, putting health in danger, changing a person's life, and causin them to lose family & friends now is up to you the rest.",8
199,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, walking into a room seeing people interacting with their computer screen I earning new and exciting, information they can everyday. The question is what effects do computers have on people? I certainly think computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and peapre, and even allow people to talk online with others. Computers can definetly have a positive on soriety. Computers have tought a very valueable to every user; hand-eye coordination! Whetver it's clicking a link to a site that you found on @ORGANIZATION2, or playing the matching same of bejeweled, you are learing hand-eye coordination. A cording to recent studies, over @PERCENT1 of people interviewed said they had excellent hand-eye coordination and @PERCENT2 said it was on the computer. Sure we all need to get exercise outside, but the computer can be helpful as long as we don't let it overwelm us. Smart people would agree that coordination is a very helpful skill. These brilliant inventions also helps us learn a bout different places and people. Picture this scenario if you will; A student at @ORGANIZATION1 has to do a project on the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the @LOCATION1. He goes to the library to check out the encyclopedias but... they are out of date. He then goes to the computer lab and finds it on @ORGANIZATION2 like that! This scenario shows that the computer is one of the fastect ways to get information on any subject or topic. Certainly text sources can give the same accurate information, but the computer is fast and easy. When you need information on the line. But why stop there? not only can you get information on certain people and places on these machines, you can also learn what's the newest fads, what's carrently happening in @LOCATION2, and the latest @CAPS6 gossip. The computer is definetly a easy sources for information on different areas and people. This amazing device can also let you talk to people online! There are many ways to do this. You can use the old-fashioned @CAPS7-mail, you can use a device in the @CAPS8 called someone. You of course need a @CAPS9 to do thank one. I remenber a time when I was bored so I decided to do my homework. The problem was I forgot what it was! I quickly grabbed the phone and called my class mate but he didn't answer. I then sprinted to my computer and to see if he was online. Sure enough he was! I got the home work and got an A all thanks to the computers ability to interact with others.",12
200,"In present day, most people live on the computer. Whether if for work or pleasure, everyone uses a computer. In a recent study, researchers determined that an average person spends @NUM1 years of his or her life on the comptuer. Thats a total of @NUM1 years of life waste. Most kids spend all day on the computer on @CAPS1, facebook, @CAPS2, and youtube. They could be using that time to be around family and friends making memories. Kids dont realize how short life is, they should be hiking, camping, spending time with friends and family. I think years from now when kids grow into adults, they will be looking back and regretting not spending more time with there family, or not taking opportunities to explore the world we live in. Instead, they will be looking back and thinking about the halarious video on youtube that got over one million hits. Also, as you @MONTH1 know child obesety is on the rise, they are more overweight kids then there are then and healthy. If a you look back to the times before computers, you will notice that you will rarely see an overweight child. The computer is to blame for this new pamedemic. Kids should be outdoors playing sports and getting fresh air. I bet that if computers were taken away for @NUM3 year, then the changes in health would be drastic. Kids would be alot healtheir and have lost the weight I hope that everyone can see the harms of the computer by reading this, and they will get rid of this poisiness object. ",8
201,"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it helps them learn about foreign places, it allows them to connect with family and friends that live far away, and it helps them with their jobs. Computers help people learn about foreign places. Before my uncle went to @LOCATION4, he wanted to learn about their culture. He went on the computer and researched @CAPS1 culture, so that he can be prepared. How would you feel if you went another country and knew nothing about it? What if you were to go to that country and do something that was disrespectful to their culture, but you didn't know because you didn't do research on it? I know I would feel bad. Now some people might say that you can read a book on that country, but not everyone has time to sit and read a book. Computers make the world a little smaller and helps us learn about each other. I think that's pretty positive. Don't you? People connect with each other through the computer. More than @PERCENT1 of people who move away from their family and friends reconnect with them through computers. Nowadays there are social networking sites, like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4, that gives people the chance to contact a family or friend that lives far away. When I moved to @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION2, I thought that I was never going to see my best friend again. But then, I got a @CAPS3 and found her on there. I was very estatic. We swapped numbers and addresses. Now everyday I talk to her on the computer. Also, the only way I talk to my aunty, who lives in @LOCATION3, is by the computer. I can't talk to her on the phone because that would run my phone bill up. Another reason that computers are positive is that is helps people find their biological parents or siblings. It brings them together and helps them reconnect with each other. Computers help people with their job. Anybody who is a @CAPS6 of a company has a laptop. It helps them store data, files, and important information. Computers are essential to these people. Also, it helps them keep track of their company if they go on a vacation. How would you feel if you owned a company and went on a vacation, but you couldn't keep track of it because you didn't have a computer. Computers have a positive effect on people because it helps learn about places, talk to their family, and keep track of their job.",9
202,"Dear Newspaper, I often think about the effect of technology on humans. The human race has discovered many things but our biggest advance is technology. New machines are robots are built all the time, and our knowledge of machines and artificial minds is rapidly growing. The most widely used machine is the computer. People use it for all sorts of things, communucation, awareness and learning and entertainment. Some experts are concerned that people spend too much time on computers and it couldn't agree more. Computers maybe useful but they are over used. People spend more time staring at the screen than exercising and interacting with friends and family. Computers are also not always dependable or safe. First of all, the biggest computer users are adolesents. Young adults spend hours on websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 communicating with their friends. At their young age, exercise is very important. Obesity in children from lack of exercise is becoming very common, and its because young people are glued to their computer screens. The averange child need @NUM1 minutes of exercise a day, and many have very little none. I say the computers are ok, but only in small doses. The growing mind and body needs to move and exercise. If internet use among children and teenagers is not cut back, some worry that there will be a lot more health problems in the future. Although it is very east to quickly communicat through the internet, it can sometimes do more harm than good. Kids who spend hours @CAPS4 or emailing their peers spend less time with their families. I've heard parents say they barely see their kids because their always either doing homework. Also, @CAPS5 to @CAPS5 conversations are fading. Because of the internet, people no longer need to get together and talk, @CAPS6 turn on their computers, which is a waste of energy. Why not just go see your friend @CAPS6 of typing all day? Lastly, computers have just as many disadvantages as they do advantages. There are plenty of dangers out there in @LOCATION1. Online predators lurk as many comers, and your personal information and identity can easily be stolen. The risk of any of these things happening is very high. Its better safe than sorry. So, if you think about it, we really don't need computers to survive. You need your exercise, don't blow it off for online chat. Also, its very important to interact and be part of your family, and less internet use will cut down the risk of identity theft, or any other problem or virus. It's your time now. Get outside have @CAPS5 to @CAPS5 conversation with a friend and internet with your family. You can be healthy, happy, and safe without constantly typing any at the keyboard.",10
203,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers are a helpful advantage in the @CAPS4's life. It offers and contributes many ideas and actions. Computers help people find a nice spot to travel. Also it helps people meet or make @CAPS1 friends. A computer is another way for people to get thier hand-eye cordination better. Computers are very helpfull in a humans life. Computers are usefull when trying to explore @CAPS1 places. One can book a flight anywhere in a matter of minits on a computer. How else would it be possible to travel somplace far away without booking a flight on a computer. Next, computers help learn about different coltures. Once one has booked reservations to a certain travel spot on thier computer, they will learn much about the unfamiliar land they have went to. My family has gone to many different areas around the world. The trips would not have been possible without help researching and making flights with the computers. The computer makes it possible to experience to territorys. It is a key item when someone is looking to travel. A computer is emensly important when trying to communicate with friends. People can meet and make friends very simply using websites such as facebook on the computer. Facebook creats friendship very easily. I recently waited to get to know a students better. I looked him up on facebook and now we are aqetances. Next, programs on the computers such as A.I.M. help people communicate about anything such as homework to other personal topics. Lastly, if one wants to get to know another better he or she can look at thier blog. They @MONTH1 start to talk and become good friends. Computers are usfull when trying to comunicate or find friends. Computers not only help with travel and friends but it also helps with ones hand eye cordination. Typing letters while looking at a screen is using the hand eye coordination. This action can help with sports. For example in baseball one must have a good hand eye cordination to help catch and hit the ball. Secondly, with hand eye cordination getting better with the computer. it helps kids fit in. If one has good hand eye cordination they can play sports are make friends. If one becomes good with hand eye cordination and typeing they will be able to get a job writing for a newspaper or a book. Hand eye cordination and typing with computers can lead to a succesfull life. Computers in an @CAPS5 life can help in the long run. It will help with travel plans, friends, and hand eye cordination.",10

The internet is fast, simple and reliable when you know how to use it."" said student @PERSON1. Children from the age of @NUM1 and up are learning how to use the internets multiple online encyclopidias, amagazines, newssites or other resources to get information. I remember my kindergarden computer class where we'd reserch dinnosaurs and weather patterns on kid friendly websites. And now being in middle school we use websites like @CAPS1 Online for up to date reliable information. Moreover, I've seen my mom, a nurse and hospital manager, use the internet for videos and articles on how to do certian procederes and ways to orginnaize a productive hospital. The internet is a great way to have a highway of information at the touch of a button. Furthermore, computers are used as a way for people to stay in touch. @PERCENT2 of teenagers say they talk to other peers using @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 or @CAPS5. Its a great way for us to communicate with our busy schedules when we can't always get together. Also with parents losing jobs in this ecconomic downfall, kids are always moving. Last @DATE1 one of my best friends in the world moved all the way to @LOCATION1. I though we'd never talk again and I was so upset to say goodbye, but because of @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 we talk non-stop and have accually never been closer. And its not just for young people to fool around with friends but adults use social network too. They connect for buissness through the internet and talk about future deals or problems and even use it to connect with old friends they haven't spoken to since college or childhood. As you can see the internet has had many positive effects from doing reserch faster to connecting with old friends, computers ar helping everyone.""",9

You can learn skill from book, tv and computers. For example i learned how to type rapidly on a keyboard from a computer on a game called type to learn. After a week of this game. I was typing like a pro. The computer also has chess to help build stragety. Just ask my super smart english teacher @PERSON1 ""she say that chess build's character and strength your mind.

For one reason the computer helps people find out information about anything. Also, it helps people do work. Plus, you can comunicate with anyone you want. Dont make any decitions before thinking about these effects on people. First of all, computers helps people find information quicly. To find information everybody uses either google or ask and many more. The information that people find would probably help them find were a store is or a number for a restaurant. Not just that but, you can find at how much something is at a store and if it is on sale or not. These are just some of the great effects computers have on people. However, work is a really large effect computers have on people. For example, computers would really help someone if they are looking for a job because their are many stores you get to choose from. To go along with that, adults and children use the computer to type something on word if its for a report for work or an essay in school. Maybe you have used the computer to type information for your newspaper. Yet, one thing kids love to do on the computer is comunicate with their friends. Most kids either use facebook, @CAPS2, or oovoo to comunicate. Having these programs helps kids stay in touch with friends that moved away. Plus, one thing good about these programs are if you have family that live very far away from you, you can always talk to them at any time. I understand why you think computer dont have an effect on people. Computers do have many effects on people. Thats not all, computers help people find what their looking for. It also helps you with your work. Never the less computers are a great way to comunicate with friends or family. Think long and hard about what decition that you want to make.",8
208,"Dear Local newspaper, Technology is a ever evolving thing and more and more people are using it. With more people making use of computers, will be the more technology benefits our society. Through the use of computer people will be taught hand-eye coordination, be presented with the ability to become educated on distant places, and also allow people to talk online with other people. Through the use of computers people will be taught hand-eye coordination. A effective skill to learn would be hand-eye coordination, the benefits of this would be outstanding. Having great coordination would mean that person would exceed past anybody who do not use computers. Advanced coordination would mean that person would able to accomplish more things like fast typing. Finally better hand-eye coordination means that person will be more likely to obtain a job in a field that needs good coordination.",6
209,"I disagree what people say about computers. Likewise of corse they teach hand eye coordination. But they are not good enough for people. Lets find out what I have to say to these people who think that computers have a positive effect on people. People are so fat! Wounder why. Because they spend to much time on computers and less time exercising. Anyways @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 is obese. Concluding that some people die each year of being over weight. Think of it this way baseball players and so on can get about @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year, isn't that what you want to be millionaires? Isn't nature so great when you exsperiance it? Well I think so because people don't think before choping down trees. Think about the animals don't you think they get enough torrocher evey year. Computers are such a bad influiance to people agian because people need to experiance life an not sit behind a desk or a home being lazy. Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder. You should not interacted with friends on the internet for that reason. You should get some exersise at the park with your firends and family. Aslo its better to talk to new friends in person because you can get to now them better as you grow up. There are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse. Don't use computers for stupid reasons. Or might get yourself killed. It makes you so felt that you won't be able to walk. Just keep that in mind people.",8
210,"Dear newspaper I think that there are many reason why computers are good for people. Compters are good for people because they help keep friends conected. Reason two is that they can be great knowledg   for people. @CAPS1 third reason that computers are good for people is that there are many programs that are team based and help people with teamworks and team building skills. Those are three of the many reasons why I think that computers are good for people and have had a positive effect. First of all, I think that computers are good for people because they help keep friends connected. If you move to another town, go to a colledge far away, or move because of a job you will most likely, if @CAPS5 is further away, loose connection with you friends. But, using a computer can solve that problem. In social networking sites like @CAPS3, twitter and myspace you can simpily look up your distant friends from  you previoulsy lived and have contact with them. Youi can catch up with each other, recall good times you've had, end maybe make plans to meet each other sometime. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have been reconnected using social networking site on a computer. Experts also say that @CAPS5 is important to stay connected with your past to sustain a well being and to be happier. I have had an experience when a scoial networking site has reconnected me with a @CAPS2. When i was younger I had a @CAPS2 whos grandmother lived  to @CAPS1 dad. After a little over a year of  him being good friends be moves to @LOCATION1, I thought I would never hear from him again. Later that year I also moved to a different town, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 searched me on @CAPS3 and we got connected again, I have found out he moved back to where I use to live. That is the first reason I think that computers are @CAPS4 good for people. The second reason, @CAPS5 is that computers can be great knowledge scources for people. If you ever need to set information   that not have to  through the  of book,then, a computer is the thing for you. As long as you than  to find an accurate and reliable scourse than a computer. Is an amazing tool. You can look up almost anything and you will be able to find locks of information on @CAPS5. Statistics show that you can find @PERCENT2 more information on a computer than a book. Experts have stated that soon books will be obsolite and computer will rain  as knowledge scources. That is the second reason why I think computers are good for people. Last of all, I think that computers are good for people because there are many programs that help with teamwork and team buildings skills. What I  by programs is yes of course videogames. Almost all of the computer games out have multiplayer features. Withins the multiplayer universe there are match types that involve a great amount of teamwork. In the age games you must communicate and talk to your team if you want to win. And that is the only way you will win is by using teamwork. That is @CAPS1 third reason why I think computers are good for people. In conclusion, I think that computers are good for people, they help to reconnect friends, , knowledge, and build teambuilding skills with programs that are out for @CAPS5.",9
211,I not agreed the people shuld d in the computer a lot and I going to said way. My first reason is because if you are a @NUM1 old man or your not going to d wit your kids and you going to have eyes problem so thas way you shuld in d in the computer a lot. My secon reason is the you going to have problem wit your wife if she found out the you are talking to another woman online because a lot of people they wife found out the they cant d wit other woman. My teard reason is the if you are a kid like me you not going to have fun and you not going to have friends because the computer problem came and go and not going to d wit your family and you lil sister out said playing wit her. So thas why you shulding d a lot in the computer.,4
212,"Isn't it great getting a refreshing when your outside? Wouldn't you experiences the rush of jumping into the crashing waves of the @LOCATION1 instead of sitting inside, gazing at pictures of the @LOCATION1? You might think that computers are helping society today, but you are wrong. The human race has survived over hundreds of years without computers and we can survive hundreds more. Computers are helping society become more and more lazy. We can get just as much information out of books if we try our best. Hand-eye coordination is important, and we can get it though activities, such as football, and tennis. We can also get it from activities! Drawing, reading, and even playing an instrument can all improve hand-eye coordination while letting you explore your creative side. Some people believe that computers teach hand-eye coordination, and it can but there are better ways to get it. It would take longer to get it from a computer than an activity. Many people like to travel in all different places of the world, but going to a foreign area with no knowledge don't smart at all. So what do you do? Go the most convinient source, internet. But what if I told you that any person could put anything on the internet? You could be getting info on @LOCATION3 when you think you're getting info on @LOCATION2. The most reliable source would be from a book. Reading is very powerful, especially if you're reading from a good source. Kids lately have been making lives on the internet. The only way they communicate is through online chat. Chatting online can/should never replace time in person with friends. Relationships with others online is never real. We're using our knowledge of how to communicate with others. The internet isn't worth it. So as you can see computers are no good. Thank you.",8
213,"Do you love technology? More and more people in this world are using so much technology and especialy computers. But not everyone agrees that this benefit society. But I do. Because it can glue people the ability to learn about anything they want to learn. Then it can give a better communication to others that lives farther away from you. My last reason is this technology can be a good way of protecting this country. Now I agree that computers can be useful man made sorce. When I was about @NUM1 years old I loved to play on the computer I thought that this was just a game. But my dad told me that do not abuce the computer, use it for education. I found out that theres so many things to teech about just a click of a botton. Now you can use this technology as a tool not a game. You might not want to go to the library to find a book you can just look it up in the computer. People love to talk to others, to meat new people or just comunicate to others who live in a other country. One of the best ways are on the computer. I am @NUM2 years old and I have alot of friends that chat on the computer, and I am one of them. My family members live in @LOCATION1, and I just can't catch, a plane every day to go visit them. So I just go on the computer and talk to them it's one of the fastest ways and fun ways to. The @ORGANIZATION1 has one of the strongest @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION3 in the world. You would not believe the technology they have and how they use them. One of the best things they have is the ""@PERSON1."" @CAPS1 a plane drivin by a remote control. It's just like a fighter plane but without a pilot! The person controling it can relax in bace wile the @PERSON1 does all the work now come and join me to say that computers are useful in this world! From the reasons above, I state that computers are useful because they give people the ability to learn about anything they want. It gives' a way to comunicate. Last @CAPS1 a good way to protect this country. Technology is growing faster by the minute and strogger. So take my word ""don't abuse it, use it.""",8
214,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 my name is @CAPS3 and I do not no where to start this letter. Im writing you this letter to let you know that I think that not everyone should use a computer. My first reason not everyone should use a computer is because they get so distracted in the computer they forget about school. My second reason not everyone should use a computer is because they @CAPS4 dont spent time with there parent. My third reason they shouldn't have people use the computer often is because they would get sick. My firs reason computer shouldnt be used often is because they forget about school. They forget about it in the way that there so distracted writing or chating or playing @CAPS4 that they forget about school. @CAPS5 reason is because their grades get low. They dont do homework either. My second reason is because they dont parents. Are more could be there so the computer they dont. My third reason is because their get computer there get @CAPS4 they dont and not @CAPS5 could that they dont get no education for being in the computer. That is why is bad to use a computer a lot I hope u understand.",7
215,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers do not benefit society. They do more bad than good in my opinion. People aren't on the computer to research people. They are on to check @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5. They need to get outside and see the outside world, people should interact with family and friends. Humans that have to much on time on their hands. So their bored maybe they will make a @CAPS3 account or if they already have on then they will maybe one of the games on their and eventually you get addicted to @CAPS3 and you never go off of it. Our society needs to encourage people to get outside and only use your computer to check your email, add something to your ipod, and maybe check if you have any notification on @CAPS3. If you want to really have a great life sitting in front of the computer your entire life isn't going to let you have that kind of fun. Ya need to live your life like your going to die tommorow. Get outside, watch the big game with all your buddies. Go on a vacation get away with your family. Travel the world and rember every part of it. Wouldn't you rather be doing that then to be sitting in front of your computer? We need to inform our state about this problem. There is a reason why we are becoming one of the fastest countries! People are not leaving their house and not getting active. If people avoid their computers then we could be one of the fittest countries.",6
216,"Readers of ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" should be well informed of the benifets of computers to society. Not only do they teach hand-eye coordination, but they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and provide a means to easy, online communication. In this day and age, good coordination is esencial to prospering in society. Using computers provides a method of both establishing and improving hand-eye coordination from the comfort of your own household or workplace. Dr. @DR1, of @ORGANIZATION1 medical center, says that a recent study shows @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 computers users have better hand-eye coordination than people who do not operate on a computer regularly. In a local primary school, students have begun to ""@CAPS2 to learn"", a program that promotes quick typing. School officials have seen a dramatic increase in the typing speed of children since the program was started in @DATE1. In this way, the computer provides a secure route to better hand-eye coordination. Even more importantly, the hand-eye coordination gained from using a computer can increase the chances of getting a job involving computer hand-eye coordination as an adult such as the position of a secretary or grafic designer. While hand-eye coordination is a factor of computers that has an extremely positive effect on people, the ability to learn about distant places with the touch of a keyboard is even more benificial towards all users. Website such as google and yahoo can track down millions of results in a matter of seconds if you search the name of a city or country. This can be handy when working on school projects as well; instead of having to lug tens of books home to finish an essay on @LOCATION1, you can simply look up the information on a computer at your house. When summertime comes around, and the last school bell rings, you can instead research faraway places that could turn into vacation spots instead of homework assignments. All of the travel information from plane tickets to the right currency is at your fingertips on a computer. If ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" readers were aware of this, lots of trouble would be prevented and lots of time would be saved. The one component of computers that is used even more than research is online communication. State officials, governers, and even the president can post messages on websites for citizens to view while they check the weather or their email. This is a much easier way to hear goverment statements than waiting through endless commercials to hear speeches on the @CAPS4. Social networking sites are also immensly popular, and on pages like facebook and twitter you can reconnect with people who you don't have the chance to see everyday, or don't lie relative vincinity. If your cousin is going to school abroad, and did not have access to an international phone, you could communicate with them through email on the computer, and it would be as if they never left. It is ridiculous to think that someone could find computers - the gateway to faraway places, good hand-eye coordination, and the connection ten distant friends and family - a concern to society. They help town in countless ways and ""@CAPS5 @CAPS1"" readers should be aware of this.",11
217,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that computers do benefit society in a positive way. Without computers we would not be able to be as social. We also would not have the ability to do reseach for school online and running a business would be even more difficult. Without computers our society would not be so far advanced. Being social is an important quality in life. the main way of being social these days, other than texting, is to chat online with friends. Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and skype all give their users the ability to make new friends, find long lost friends, and chat with friends. I personally have a skype and facabook, and I am able to access them everyday. Without them, I wouldn't be able to chat with friends out of school except for sports and texting. Everyday I workout and lift weights and go on facebook, that is why that whole statement, ""spending less time exercising, and more time on the computer"" is false. Facebook and skype are a past of my everyday life and without them I know I would not be as social. Computers are also a part of my everyday life, because I have to use it to do research for school or typing up an @CAPS5 paper. As you have now seen, my handwriting is not so great, so I end up typing a lot of my homework because of it. Without computers my teachers would not be able to read my work. Computers also help with making graphs and data tables for science lab reports. Without a computer the graphs would have to be handmade, which is not as presentable. Overall computers are used everyday in school to either do research or to type up some homework. Education plays a key role in society and if we did not use computers out education that we would receive would not be the same as it is now. My last reason why i believe that computers play a positive role in society is that computers are what keeps businesses running. Without computers some businesses would be unable to function, and those could function, would be awful slow. Since our society is so far advanced our businesses need computers in order to complete the jobs. Expenses and income are saved to businesses computers, if that was all done an paper they could be lost or ruined. Computers also simplify work for businesses, they speed up the tasks that would takes a long time to be hand done and they complete the tasks that could not be acheived without a computer. Computers play a large part in the @CAPS6 of the world.",11
218,"Computers are an incredibly important part of many peoples lifestyles. They can give us wonderful facts and news that would otherwise be hard to obtain. Computers also allow people an easy way to communicate with friends and family without using a phone. Lastly computers are an incredibly useful tool for writing. One of the most beneficial parts of computers is that you can find out whats happening anywhere in the world. For instance, I could do a search engine on recent disaters and find hundreds of articles on @CAPS1 and other recent news. However you could also find out interesting facts like how many have chosen to sail around the world in the past ten years. But this is just one of the many uses a computer has. Critics @MONTH1 think that the use of computers interferes with spending time with your friends and family. But computers can actually do the opposite. There are many websites that allow you to talk safely to people. Some of those websites are facebook and chatme.com. Did you know that you can even video chat with people. It's just like youre right there with you. Incredibly, unlike calling people and using a phone using these websites is free and open to anyone. This brings me to the last point. Computers are great writing tools. They allow you to write efficiently and neatly. Also, programs liek microsoft word allow you to spell check your work. However one of the most usefull qualitus of a program like word is that it allows you to change your work and add sentences or words wherever you want. Its you can see computers are a usefull and beneficial part of society. They allow people to easily stay informed on world news. Secondly computers allow easy and safe communication between people and lastly they are usefull for writing papers such as writing prompts. I hope that by reading this, you can now see some of the many uses of computers.",8
219,"Fairfield @CAPS1 @CAPS2 computers have a bad effect on people? Many people say ""yes"" and many say ""no."" @CAPS3 a matter of fact, computers @CAPS2 have a bad effect. People are very easily distracted on computers, it wastes time, and it causes stress. Many kids who @CAPS2 there homework on computers are very easily distracted. With computers come the internet, and with the internet comes games and social networking sites. Many kids would rather chat on facebook with a friend than @CAPS2 homework using an online book... including me. When I get home, I start using the online text book for my math class. But when I wait for it to load I get bored and go on online game website. After that I get too distracted on this addicting game called ""@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1."" And @NUM2 hours of playing online games I realized I have wasted a lot of time. I realized I have been wasting a lot of my math homework time lately with those online distracting game. And @PERCENT1 of my grade in math is homework I've gone from a @CAPS4 to a @CAPS5+. And why waste time on the computer. Outdoors are just @CAPS3 fun @CAPS3 ""@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1."" I'd rather be playing football with my friends than that dumb game. My parents have also realized that I've been wasting so much time on the computer they've blocked the internet. But distracting games that waste time also cause stress, which could be fatal. Imagine being in the hospital because of playing on the computer. Once while I was watching the @ORGANIZATION1, a man said @NUM4 people died because of playing on the computer for over @NUM2 days with little food or water. My parents also notice that me and my brother are grumpy after playing on the computer for so long. And I've been stressed lately. Overall, computers have a bad effect on people.

221,I think that you can never spend enuf time on the computer it feel there is no bad effet computors can have on you they only improve your life is why. For one thing if you need to find out a important fact date or time. You can just look it up on the computor. The internt is a never ending sorce of knolage and you can learn just about any thing that you need to know just by searching it on the computor.Another usefull thing the computor dose is the ability to talk to people useing eother @CAPS1-mail @CAPS2 or that rooms you can meet new people or talk to a distant friend or relitive on the computor and you can even hook up a web camera and actuly see theam as they talk to you something a phone cannot do. Also the computor is a good souce of entertainment. You can play a number of games off the internet. You can even down load consal games onto your computor. Another thing you can do is watch full episodes of @CAPS3 shows and movies like if you wer fallewing a telivison selles and you missed an episode you can just go look it up. And a favorit of mine is youtube wether you watch random videos watch famous youtube stars on post videos of your own ther is always fun to be had. And finaly all the programs on the computer ther is an endless amont of programs you can have downloaded they can be for fun such as paint and flash or they can be important like worn or knot book every program tha computer offers is usefull and fun to use and you can use most of these programs to help you in the real. Now I have mentioned some of the many thing why you can never spend enuf time on the computer shure exersise and nator can be helth but you can do only of that stuff I just mentond by takeing a nator walk so wont you agree computors improve our life more then they are unhealthy.,8
222,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have both negative and positive affects on people. Many people before us went through everyday life without them. Although there are many good affects that computers have on people, the negative affect's outnumber them by far. For example, generations have lived and died without computers and it didn't affect them. Not only that but many children and adults in this centry are obese due to growing technology. Many people become obese because they were born with this technology and after years, or even days of sitting in front of their computer, they become lazy. They look to a computer as necesity and not a form of entertainment. Even though computers keep people in contact and keep them updated in their lives, that is the only important reason for a computer. As a student, I use my computer for my schoolwork. Everything I do on my computer involves either typing a paper or printing research. I could do these things with paper and pencil and ask people what I'm trying to find out. This is important because it shows that people don't need to be defandent on computers when they can do everything they need to without them. Lastly, computers aren't needed when we have the availability of cell phones that keep everyone in contact without computer games, chats or profiles. Also phones are safe so they cant get viruses and strangers cant look at your personal information, finding out where you live. In conclusion computers aren't healthy, keep you sitting, without exercise and aren't nessasary.",8

Also the students can use the computer as a way to study. There are educational games on the computer that kids play and without knowing this they are learning and studying for school. Another way you could too a is from online classes. This could help people also because do not have enough many to pay to go to classes. As you can see there are many ways to learn from having computer. The computer can also help you talk to people from out of the state or country.

224,"Dear local newspaper, I think it's okay for people all over the world to use computers: The reason why I @CAPS1 this is because a lot of people us computers for a lot of things. People all over the world use computers for something important, in case of emergency and much more. Us kids/students in @ORGANIZATION1 use computers to go on myspace, facebook, and the chat lie. to talk to our friends or even to talk to other people in the world. We also talk to our family that lives somewhre far away from the @LOCATION1 of lives here in the @LOCATION1 but in a different state. Lots of us kids go to myspace to talk to friends, family, people who we don't even know, people from all over the world and people that we havn't seen in years. Well then agian people also use computers to sell drugs which is very bad for our enviorment. This is one good reason why people are so effective and addictive to their Computers because bad people and drug dealers sell drugs over the enternet and other bad people and drug dealers buy the drugs over the enternet. As far as i know a lot people over the enternet I alson know that the people outside the enternet wouldn't do those things and even the people inside the enternet wouldn't do those bad things and sell drugs over the enternet. The reason why I know this is because they're my friends. They're smart and they just wouldn't do no such thing over the enternet or even at all. I tell you agian to my local newspaper it is okay for the people around the entire world to use any computer, @CAPS2, @NUM1 or anthing as long as they have connection but as for the drug dealers and bad people is up to than if they want to keep doing want they keep doing because eventually they will end up getting cought and getting brought to jail. I tell you that computers are meant to have fun but not meant to drugs over the enternet but anyway",7
225,"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 spend to much time on their computers. I belive people should spend more time outside with their family. This can certainly lead to brain problems, hard time seeing and the biggest thing is death. First of all there are people with brain problems because they are on the computer to much. When they are out with their family they think of their computer. People stay on their computer for a non-stop amount of time. In a resent survey it showed that teenagers stay on the computers the most. Most people don't have a life outside their computer room. Most of all eye doctors have been getting call from parents. They are worried that their child/children have a hard time seeing. I interviewed an eye doctor and this is what he had to say, ""I had one child come into @CAPS3 office and he had the hardest time seeing"". He asked the kids mother why is he having a hard time seeing and she said, ""@CAPS3 son spends on average of three and a half hours on the computer."" The child had to get a pair of special glasses so that he could see better. These glasses aare really expensive. I have read about children and adults deing from using the computer to much. They have fried their brain from using the computer to much. Their brain tells them to do things that are illegal. For example: breaking in homes, killing people, and high sacking cars. I heard one kid used the computer to much that he started to kill people and got shot by a cop. The more people die from using the computer to much the higher the death toll will be. It is now or never @CAPS3 friends out there to work together on cutting down on how much we use the computer. I'm sure that no one wants to be part of the death toll until we really have to. It is time to go outside and have fun with your family. They miss spending time with you. So get off your butt and go outside. But wait, make sure you trun your computer off so that you are not temted to go back on it.",8
226,"Dear @PERSON3 of the @LOCATION1, I strongly believe that computers effect us in a positive way.

First and foremost computers are effecting us positively expesally when it comes to finding and talking to family and friends. My mom was adopted and @NUM1 years ago she really wanted to find her birth family, one year later her birth father found her on this website where you can locate family, she found her family and I now have two more @CAPS1, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, and a cousin @PERSON4. I love them all very much. I would not have of been able to get to know them if it wasnt for the computer, speaking of communication, I was working like a dog on this big science prodject I had. we weren't able to do it in person and it @CAPS3 impossible for one person to three way four people. So we emailed our ideas and thoughts and were able to get the project done. ""@CAPS2 are never enough hours in the day!"" @CAPS3 something that @CAPS3 commonly said. Over @PERCENT1 of adults complain that @CAPS2 @CAPS3 never enough time in day. That @CAPS3 a statistic from @ORGANIZATION1. The computer allows you to multi task so you can be on your business call and email your mother so she know that you didn't forget her birthday. In addition, computers help us understand other countries and learn about their culture and how they are doing. @CAPS2 are many people who don't have tvs and they get their news from the internet. Also for projects, in @NUM2 grade I had to learn about @CAPS4, the country in @LOCATION2. it would take countless hours to find research in books, you will find a lot of stuff you dont need, but on the computer it @CAPS3 fast and easy. If you need to know something you can just type it in and, boom! You have it where as if you were usinf a book you would still be looking for what you need. Time @CAPS3 something that we can't afford to waste expessaly in this economy. Furthermore, computers are great for all kinds of research and directions. People who think that people spend too much time on the computer, and exersizing are not always right. I don't know about you, @PERSON3, but I am constantly looking up different exersizes to get a flat stomach. Most of my friends do it with me. I also look up directions, finding routs on maps are enfuriating and take for ever. Go on the computer the maps are always updated and you can get easy and fast directions! I don't know about you but I love things fast and easy. Going back to research, what about for solving crimes? Identifying people with finger prints fast so no one can get hurt. In conclusion computers effect us in possitive ways, more and are a great help to society, from locating people, to communication, and all the way to finding valuable and life changing information. I hope that you and I see eye to eye in this matter, advancing computers are our friends not the enemy.",10
227,"Dear newspaper, In my opinion, computers definetely have a negative effect on people. People who use computers often spend less time exercising. I mean, who would give up their chatrooms and games to get in shape? I remember when i was a little girl - about @NUM1 years old, and i always wanted to be on the computer. I soon got chubby and gained about @NUM2 lbs! I quickly realized the computer is a tool used only when necessary. because it shortens activity time. A survey done by the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1) showed that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS4 between ages @NUM3 are overweight because of their computer use. Famous singer @PERSON2 says. ""I keep going and losing weight because of computers! I will gain weight and then run it off and ignore the computer for a week."" I know you might be thinking that computers dont make you obese if you use it sparingly, but research has proven that more than @NUM4 mins a day can make you gain fat. Clearly, computers are to blame for our society's weight problem. Have you ever really seen nature's beauty? People who use computers don't! I mean, people are too busy looking up things on the web that nobody can truly appreciate. the outside world. I remember when i watched the movie @CAPS2 last week, I thought to myself, ""@CAPS3, nature is amazing, why didn't I notice before?"" I already know the answer. Computer, A survey conducted by @NUM5 grade @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 showed that @NUM6 out of @NUM7 @CAPS4 have never noticed the blooming flowers or the smell of fresh rain. Famous physician, @PERSON4, ""@CAPS4 that dont see nature for its true beauty often can't grow up normally. People were supposed to be naked to nature, but over the years, technology has diminished that connection."" I know you @MONTH1 that that @CAPS4 see enough of nature even with computers but more than often., @CAPS4 dont pay attention to nature. They are too busy with computers. Obviously, nature is ignored by society because of computers. Familes grow more and more detached every time a child or even adult uses a computer. I mean, every time you hit that on switch, you and the computer become attached. You can't focus on the people around you. I remember when my sister @PERSON5 was in @NUM5 grade, she never took her eyes off the computer. She would play solitore and instant message her friends all the time and she then completely disconnected with the family. A test done by @ORGANIZATION3 showed that teens will rebel @NUM9 times more than usual with the aid of a computer. Famous talk-show host, @PERSON3 says, ""@CAPS4 shouldn't use computer, they will get detached from friends and family."" I know you're thinking @CAPS4 dont get detached, but they di. Clearly @CAPS4 seperate from their friends and family because of computers. In conclusion, any far minded person can tell that computers have a negative effect on people because they consume exercise time, make @CAPS4 forget about nature, and seperate family and friends. Therefore, I urge you to not use computers!",11
228,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you like a place where you can control what you @CAPS1 and where you go? I know I @CAPS1. Well, if you afree with me then the computer is your cup of tea I think that computers have a positive effect on society. I think this for @NUM1 main reasons @CAPS2 with others, getting constant updates on whats going on, and a learning tool make up only some of the fasinating aspects the computer has. So read on I know you will think the same way as me about computers given my knowledge below. The computer captures over @NUM2 million humans attention with online social networks facebook, myspace, and @CAPS3 are the main attractions. In all of these websites you can keep up with whats going on with your friends and whats new around the world. These online social networks connect you and the people in your life to a crazy online adventure. All these websites provide the information that people want and keep nthem logging back on everyday. I think these websites are great and can only improve society. This is my first benefit of a computer. Another way aspect that the computer provides is world news and big events and drama that is happening in our society. Many news channels have their own websites and update what happened on their show. They provide pictures, stories, and actual videos of whats happening right now. The computer helps us americans know what is happening in @LOCATION1 and lets @LOCATION1 know whats happening in the @LOCATION1 and the @CAPS4.S arn't the only ones trough The computers provides international news and gossip for everyone. Here is another reason why the computer is great for society. There are many things that us kids don't know and if we need some deep information we search it on the computer. The computer provides websites giving information on every time you could think of. For example, if I were to be stuck on some science homework I could probably type in my question on ask.com and get a great answer. Parents and teachers want their kids to suceed and the computer defenitly helps. In conclusion, I have given you @NUM1 great, well thought out reasons why the computer benefits society. @CAPS2 with others, updates worldwide and information on school all are in a great piece of technology called the computer. I hope you will trust me that the computer has a positive effect on society.",10
229,"Dear Local @CAPS1, I think computers benefit society greaty. Most of what we do today could not happen without computers. The biggest use of computers is comunication. If you're in @LOCATION1 on a buisnoss trip but need to send a letter to your company, you can send an emil which is much less expensive than paying for as piece of @CAPS1. The experts concerns that people aren't spending enough time with family and friends is a point. Many people cominucate with family and friends through computers. I would hardely yet to talk to my cousin if I couldn't go on facebook. I would have had to wait another month to find out my other cousin was engaged if I didn't follow her on @CAPS2. If the concern is face to face contact, the computer has a cure for that, too, a video messaging site called ooVoo. Another way computers allow comunication is through the shareing of information. Many facts needed for school are spread out in hundreds of books. Over the @CAPS3, I've done research for a project and have been able to get facts from the @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 about crime stats. Many times researching an animal will take you online because more modern books note good website to travel to for more information. Without the @CAPS3, a simple reasearch project could take for months. Some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer. This both right and wrong. Sitting at a computer watching youtube for hours is not nessasarily the best thing. However, the @CAPS4 is also for computer. The @CAPS4 has designed a game so that you can have fun while getting excersize. Computers are like chocolate. They can be good, but too much is a bad thing.",8
230,"Dear Readers, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there is a debate on whether or not computers benefit society. This issue is debatable but really I think that computers are not helping the big picture. I don't think that they benefit our health or social actions because computers keep us inside when we could be out. Everyday when I come home from school, I find myself going straight inside and to the computer from there, I log into @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. And my exersize in the next @NUM1 hours or so is only in my fingers. My point is that there is a whole world outside of we only got off our computers and played outside. Statisctis show that @NUM2 kids spend more time inside year-round than out these days. ""@CAPS1 is ridiculous how much things have changed in just @NUM3 years."" says @PERSON1 a pediatrician in @LOCATION1, ""they all need thier exersize."" @CAPS1 is cutrogeous how much people are on computers now, @CAPS1 starts to affect thier attitude, and control thier lives. Sometimes checking notifications on @CAPS3 can be more important to someone than spending time with thier family or friends. A mom of @NUM4 teens says ""They all go to thier rooms, shut thier doors and go on @CAPS3 and @CAPS6 untill dinner and after, they go right back."" In this case, they just plug into thier computers and forget about everyone else. I think @CAPS1 has gotten out of hand how much people and teens especially are addicted to computers. 1/@NUM4 mom says she sees her kid growing apart from the family because of a computer. You @MONTH1 say that when on your computer there is a person you are talking to, and while pen-pals are great, you should really go out and do something! You are talking your friends, but its not the same as being with them. On my recent trip to @LOCATION2 to go skiing, I found that some of my friends jokes funnier when you're with her and not just sitting on a computer. We had a blast! Now I regret not getting together with her to hang out. Also @NUM6 arguments now, have something to do with a missunderstanding through the computer, people @MONTH1 get the wrong message when you send something to them or they take @CAPS1 the wrong way. The truth is, computers are starting to take negative effect on our society and even ruin relationships. If we just get off our computers and get out, we can turn that around.",10
231,"Dear, Newspaper @CAPS1 my name is @CAPS2, @PERSON1 and I think that this idea based on why people need computer is a good statement/ @CAPS3. My @CAPS4 oppinon is that same say people use their computers so much they don’t yet exercise. When that is not true do to the fact that computers have. Programms on how to watch your weight. Stocks and etc also Technology helps people around the world on websites, programs such names as to video chat, @CAPS5.com for instant messaging. on the way teen stuff like computers help people for on video chatting, emailing people their rezemates to jobs on why and how their based. On showing people their recent jobs. And giving details on showing people reading this article is that technology of computers also help @CAPS6 save. Most reasons we need tech equipment is that people use it on fields such as the navy, @CAPS6, dealships, all over the world industry. Why is that good well my point of view is that business need that to order their stocks for store carriers and more. For @CAPS6 on field to use for @CAPS7 sean, pregnacy, pulse radar's and more. And on the negative point of those side of the readers are based on the mostly that people get addict to technology when the truht is that people really need technology look around you and everything in this world has mostly been made by technology and. the @CAPS8 is that people should agree. that computers help people, speak, @CAPS9, email, lives, help find family, friends, give directions, so on my point of view @CAPS9 tel your dean @CAPS1 and readers that interacting with technology. Is a good way nto control ways on how or what you do in the computers do to that in my way I make sites audio and interesting Technology can allows people on ways to help people. Find and create ways to making money or interesting positive out comes out of using person in this world goes in and thru out tech equip. These days, and to the people who have read this article should pass this story on to people who take technology on negative terms and to help them think about it positive.",7
232,"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing this letter to inform you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I don't agree I think the experts are correct that people are spending too much time on their computer. My following reasons will explain why I don't agree. I think there is also an issue with computers. Please read on to understand my reasons. First of all, my reason on not agreeing with those who support technology is because their is no saftey! I think chatting online is great but dangerous. For example, most kids are followed by and its usually online. This is because the information all to unknown people. Also, kids get into dangerous for example they get kidnapped for this informal and the people they talk to. Secondly, I don't agree because it also caused addiction to the computers. Most people get addicted for the certain things they do online. These life of can also become dangerous. For example, people play some video games wich people killing and commiting crime. We cant not do in the ""real' world. These kind of game also bring people to dangerous. Another example is we've had students bringing because violence is the answer when it ! The addiction to computer is so bad that people do have a look of and interacting with things. Lastly, I dont agree because its also. Most people who are and again. These of into an life because you do enjoying at all. For example, people die of. This letter will effect others so thanks for reading. Hopefully, people understand why I dont agree.",8
233,"My opinion on computers is that I think it's a good idea for people to go on computers. I think this way because if you haven't seen someone for so many years then you got a chance to see that person or talk to that person through the computer. Computers are also good because if you have a project to do from school then you could get good information based on what project you have to do. I like to go on the computer to talk to my friends that I haven't seen a while you could also meet new people and make friends. If there wasn't computers then we would have to look through a lot of books for information, or go all the way to the bank to check your account balance, this is why I think computers are good ideas. On the computer you could see workouts to get fit we don't only have to go to the gym. My dad gose on the computer to talk to his sisters, or play games with other people arount the world. Another example I could use is my mom she talks to her family in @LOCATION1 and in other places too. If there wasn't computer's we couldn't our tests, we couldn't get information. I think computers are very good ideas, cause it's good when you got to pay your bills too. We could interact with friend and familys online too thats what a lot of tenns and aults do if there was a rainyday or if its snowing and we don't go the chance to see our friends or relitives. For some people they think it's not a good idea because some people get addicted to the computers, but there is so much that you could do that the computer won't get you board. Thats why I think that computers are a good idea and that they are very important.",8
234,"Dear Local Newspaper, I'm writeing to you today to show how I feel on how computers have an effect on people. Computers have a very strong effect on people. Computers can cost people to gain weight, cost problem to there eyes and you couldn't pay bills. We all know that we all gain weight at some point in our life, and we can lose that weight. But if you on a computer for six hours a day you dont have time to cook a real meal. So what do you do, you eat alot of junk food. Do you really want to be the reason why someone is over weight? Picture yourself looking at bright computer sreen for six hour non-stop. Do you think that your eyes are going to be fine I disagree. When I really tried I cant even keep my eyes open and I'm pretty sure you cant say that your eyes are going to be fine when you just got looking at a bright sreen in the dark. Can you see yourself quiting you just because you say your going to work at home. But you dont do your work, and get fried, now how are you going to pay your bill with no money? Once your power goes out you have noting to do because you got fired all because of you computer. Now what are you going to do with your life? Well that all. I would like to thank you for your time. And I hope you agree with me for my three reasons you can gain weight, eye problem and how are you going to pay your bill?",8
235,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people is that computers have a good effect. It's good for education mind exercise and communication all over the world. It could @CAPS2 be bad because it would keep you from getting exircise, being with your family and being healthy. But I still think that there are ways to use computers without the bad cause. Some ways computers are good for you are that you can get a better education when you have websites with so much information. Sometimes these information are flase but if you find the websites you can get the rite information. With all of this information you ran exircise your mind to do better in life. You can @CAPS2 talk to people on the other side of the earth and get more inforamtion from them. If I were to say computers are bad for you I would I say that it keeps you from getting enough or maybe any exircise. Computers @MONTH1 be the reason why ther are so many obese people in the @LOCATION1 @CAPS2 when computers are use too much people part from their family and go into different fantasy worlds that somethimes get you addicted to them. And staying for too long on the computer cause prolems. You can get hurt by just sitting for a long amount of time at once. Being on the computer for too long can @CAPS2 cause eye problems where you will begin to lose your sight and will need glasses which will get thicker as you keep looking at the computer screen for hours and days. But even though computers cause so many problems we can prevent them by using the computer to help us. People dont get enough exircise but with the help of computers they can @CAPS2 find times and ways to exircise so that they can stay healthy. They can @CAPS2 find information about how much time should be spent on the computer to not have sight decrease or worse. Some people live far away from their family so computers really help them stay in touch and to be able to see each other. In conclusion I think that computers are more beneficial then harmfull because they give you alot of information for everything and you can comunicat with people all over the world. And computers can help you prevent those things that are bad for you by showing you ways to use computer that won't harm you.",8
236,"Dear local @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1, latly I have been noticing that some of the citizens of @ORGANIZATION1 have been using computers and laptops for a good amount of three the some people to the say @CAPS2 is a waste of time they could enjoying with family and friends with friends and family far away. @CAPS2 helps with research and learn @ORGANIZATION1 thnigs and @CAPS2 help with relaxing people. modern time and the people who disagree enjoy Some family and friends lives far away and you cant talk to them in person. There is always calling them or writing them a letter hot email, facebook, and @ORGANIZATION2 are easier and to use. When you call you dont know if your them there phones bissy, or they a bad @CAPS2 takes long and you @CAPS2 better to stay and send on and know you didn't @CAPS2 helps in advertisment and sales. Sometimes maybe unrealible because anybody can change anything on the site. Not all things online are like that though. Stay away from scares and things, they will came Some people find the internet @CAPS2 could be there from work or sites. There are fun games and to talk to In research the internet helps @PERCENT1 of people relax and calm down after a long @CAPS5, when on the computer or laptop which helps with stress.

237,"Dear @CAPS1, many people say that computers can have an bad effect on people. I came to disagree computers make our lives so much easier. We can talk to people that we have not seen in a while, we can read/see other places we thought we would never know about; And insted of having to hand write that book we can typr it up. I find these are resons that show that computers don't have a bad effect on people. Imagin you are on facebook and you type in your best friend from high schools name she pops up and you a on net. The next day she is on happy you are connected. Thats she kind of thing that happens everday people reconnect, this not only happens on facebook, not all over the internet! Reconecting with friends and family, talking to your boss on next door you can even send a picture of your new born baby to your mother who lives in @CAPS2. Having computers really allows us to reconect to these we have lost. Other are very inportant. But what if we know nothing about other cultures then what would life be like with computers we can instantly learn about other unlike having to go to the ad you have to do is type in the place and pick the size you want to look at all with using computers. @LOCATION1 ago people would have to write our everthing word by word letter by letter. Not with computers. So dont worry that @NUM1 page paper, you can just type it and with some softwear, you can even your paper edited right on the spot. This is great for not only school, children but adult to. That dissnes proposle can be done quickly and easily with computers. Many people say that computers can have a bad effect on people. But with advancing technology site gets easier, and the gives more time other things. There is no bad effect of computers. The effects is just helpful ness.",8
238,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have heard the concern of many scientists about computers. Computers have brought us into the @DATE1 and have improved our society but they are harming our childrens health and education. Because of computers, children and adults around the world are spending less time with family and friends, they are not enjoying athletic activities and they are having health problems. Because of an increase in technology, children and adults are not spending time with their families. The computers are ruining family connections. For example, a study at @ORGANIZATION1 showed that families with more computers in their houses communicated less. The children are talking to their friends online or are going on social networking sites instead of talking in person to their family members. Also, computers are making it very hard for families to have meals together. When the children are on the computer, they do not want to leave. This obsetion with the technology is making it harder for families to grow moved and of were more succesful in school. The computers are children from a better education. Athletic activities are also suffering been so of @PERSON1, fresh air more children They will be on websites all day insted of being on a. Sports teams because of computers. The electricity that runs computers of this radiation. Being exposed to this could lead to brain damage or possible death. When my aunt bought a computer for the first time, she complained about massive headaches that kept returning. This was caused by the radiation emitted from the computer. Another health risk is obesity. When children sit in front of a computer for many hours, they have an increase in apetite. These children eat because they have nothing better to do. While on the computer, the users eat and will gain weight because of the loss of exercise. They could become obese and possibly get diabetes. Therefore, there is less communication in families, a loss of excersise, and health concerns caused by the computers. The consequences of misusing this technology are devastating and could be life thretening. Thus, I urge you to do whatever is possible to use the computer less or face the consequences that come with it.",10
239,"Do you think computers have a negative effect on people? Well I don't I think @CAPS2 is on easier way to get information faster. The three reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people are to learn about faraway places, to have jobs in the computer, business, and you are able to talk to people from faraway. These are many other reasons but I'@CAPS1 only required to talk about three. First of all, you are able to learn about faraway places you can learn about places you aren't able to see in real life. @CAPS2 is a faster way to get information about news that wouldn't be able to out on newspaper until the next day. If you dont have money to travel then you could just go on the internet and see the faraway places in many ways, @CAPS2's just a better source of information. My second reason is to have a job in the computer business. There are alot of jobs that require computers. If we didn't have computers more and more people would not have jobs. Also, business would be slow because they wouldn't have the information they needed. That is why computers are needed. Lastly, you are able to talk to people from faraway, yes people are able to talk through the phone but its not the some if you get to talk and see the person. Video chat is a great way to make new friends and still talk with your old friends. You can talk to relatives, friends, or anyone you want to talk to. If we didn't have computers you would lose touch with people you know that live faraway from you. That would be a terrible thing. In conclusion computers are an easier way to get information. You can learn about faraway places. You can have a job in the computer business. Lastly, you are able to talk to people from faraway, I think computers are a positive thing.",8
240,"Dear local newspaper, I think computers have a positive effect on people. Some adults and mostly kids are not getting enough exercise, or even spending time with family. Some parents are less active with their kids. Kids are failing to do their homework because they are always on the computer when they get home. Adults and kids are getting less excersize. Sitting down reading or what ever they do on the computer is not excersizeing. They are going to get fat because they eat and sit down and than they get hungery again than eat and sit down. Some people say that your getting finger and arm exsersize by and moveing the mouse, thats not really true. Looking at the computer screen all day can cause masive hand People are also not spending time with family. They are sitting infront or a computer and ignoring everyone and everything around them. Kids could be enjoying other things besides computers. Parents could be outside. Playing catch with their kids or even playing a board game with them. People are not less active. They are not going out and haveing fun jumping around with their friends. Instead they aim them on computers or message them on facebook or even myspace. Kids are failing in school because they fail to do their home work after school. They would rather go on the computer. This is why i think computers have an positive effect on kids and adults.",8
241,"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a positive affect on society because it gives a lot of information, it has lots of fun games and music, and it informs you about issues in the world and communities.

If you need to do projects and research, what better way to do them than on a computer. You can search all kinds of people like the presidents of the @LOCATION1, celebrities, and people that made a change in the world. You can also look @CAPS5 and study different kinds of plants and animals, and you can find fasmating experiments to do. The second reason I think that computers have a positive affect on society is because it has lots of fun games and music. You can go on the @CAPS1 channel website and play lots of diffrent games from your favorite t.v shows. They also have learning games on test prep fun where you can play games to help you do well on your @ORGANIZATION2 such as comprehension clinic.

242,"Dear, Newspaper People should use less time on the computer because it effects their lifestyle. Instead of using their computer all the time they shoul exercise hang out with their friends and family and just enjoy nature. First of all computer's can bring a lot of obesity to the @LOCATION1 because it bring lazyness and it makes peole not went to exercise. If people start to exercise at least around @PERCENT1 of lazyness will go down. They should at least go out for a walk instead of using all their electrity. Also around @PERCENT2 of your electrity bill will go down if you go exercise instead of using computer. Secondly people need to start enjoying nature insteed of being on the computer at the time. People should go green and start recyling and not worrying about what somebody said on ""myspace"" or ""facebook"". Also if we started recyling and worring about nature @PERCENT3 of the earth would be greener. My last reson being their should be more friendler family time enstead of computer time. Computers just make you break away from your family and friends because your worrying whats happening on the internet. @PERCENT4 of people should just get of the computer all the time and just chill with your family and friends. In my conclusion these are my reasons being for people so they wont use the computer so much and so they can just kick back chill with your friend and family, exercise and enjoy natur",7
243,"To editor, @CAPS1's a beautiful day. The sun is shining, the birds are chirping, and a lazy breeze is flowing through the trees. But you don't notice any of @CAPS1 because you're plopped down in front of your comuter tapping away on @CAPS2 or email. With modern technology. This is a common scenario. Experts are concerned that excessive computer use can harm your health, hamper your social skills, and cause you to be disconnected from nature. While computers are helpful in our lives too much of one thing is never a good thing. As mentioned, camputers have can a negative effect on your health. Computers cause people to be lazy. They would rather @CAPS2 and email than go outside and excersize in the cool, crisp, fresh air. In fact, statistics recently released by the @ORGANIZATION1 show that computers are the @NUM1 leading reason for obesity. And weight problems are not the only thing computer to worry about. Too much time in front of the computer will also take @CAPS1's toll on your eyes. Even local doctors have pointed @CAPS1. ""@CAPS4 since computers have become a common household item, the number of i have eye has gone up about @NUM2 or @NUM3 more kids every year than the year says @ORGANIZATION3 of the @ORGANIZATION2. And if that isn't enough, typing too many this @CAPS5 and emails day after day can give you repetetive syndrome, also known as carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel used to be more when typewriters were big, but dwindled down once computers with newer, easier to type on keyboards came around. But excessive daily use of computers is causing doctors to see more cases of carpal tunnel crop up. @CAPS1 is clear that if you want to stay healthy, computer usage should be limited. Secondly, too much time spent on the computer affect your ability to communicate with others. Computers are helpful when you need to talk to someone but people have gott on so used in @CAPS1 that they sometimes find @CAPS1 awkward to talk to someone face to face. Their eyes look everywhere except for the person, they shift their weight back and forth and struggle to find the right words to say things that should be easy. This awkwardness can also ruin previously close friendships. Friends will talk to each other endlessly through @CAPS2, but have no words for each other when they meet face to face. I remember @DATE1, i didn't see one of my friends at all; we just @CAPS8 each other daily. When we saw each other at school, we found @CAPS1 hard to carry a conversation and @CAPS1 took some getting used to talking face to face again. And this isn't the only way friendships are ut on the line by computers. Personal and meaningful conversations @MONTH1 sometimes be. You're on the phone with your friend and you're telling her about something important that you need advice on. A few seconds after you begin talking you're interrupted by a loud @CAPS7! followed by a ""hold on, so and so just @CAPS8 me."" @CAPS9, computers seriously social skills and personal relationships. Another reason to watch how much time you spend on the comuter is that @CAPS1 can cause you to",10
244,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, The effects computers have on people can be hurting our society or it can also be helping society. As a middle schoolers growing up, I believe using computers can be beneficial at same point but it is also damaging our society. First of all, the internet is full of innapproprate content. Illegal uses are involved and can draw in anyone with just s single click of a mouse. Anyone in the world can use the technology we have today to ""hack"" or tresspass someone else's computer. Anybody can download songs or documents illegally for free, rather than paying for it themselves. In fact, not only can someone download innapropriate content right onto their screen, they can also be inflicted upon with graphic words or view a website that involves videos with drug use. criminal acts, vulgar language and more. A recent study on internet use from the @ORGANIZATION1 for internet use includes that ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" has a history of a result to suicides or depression in teens. @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is a form of @CAPS5 where someone can chat or instant message someone and hurt their feelings. Not only is @CAPS4 @CAPS5 an issue, however, people can now talk to strangers on the internet. Think about how awful it would be if your child had given out their private information online and a man who said they were the same age as your child received it and lied about their age, sex, apperance, and age. Now that man can track your child down and possibly kidnap or hurt them. Secondly, the internet can also be very unhealthy and can create you to become less social. According to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of children or teenagers that result to internet use can create a weak relationship with friends and family members if they use the computer too much. It can be very unhealthy for someone, and not just teenagers, to use the computer for an extended amount of time than they should. People can gain the effects of laziness, little brain effort, and lose interaction with the outside world. Finally, my foremost reason on how computers can be negative is how addicting it can be. From my own experience, I used to stay up late for hours using websites such as @CAPS9 because everyone else was using it. Sure, it can be entertaining and fun but using the internet won't be so much ""fun"" when your academic grades are at risk and you stop communicating with the outside world. Adiction can draw anyone in against their willpower. My own brother became so addicted to computer games that he played one game straight for @NUM1 hours straight. You can get addicted to one subject until you lose everything else you have. The internet can be great in moderation, however it can be innappropriate, unhealthy, and addicting. If technology becomes too powerful in our civilization, how can we learn to interact with our humanity. More and more peole become involved with technology and frankly it can be quite horrendous in my oppinnion.",11
245,"Dear who it @MONTH1 concern, I think that computers are very affective but then again they are not because would you rather have your kids on the computer or lets say some children smoke and some hang out in the streets to much yeah it does do a lot affect to them. In my predictionI say computers are very addictive but then again it really isn't because there are some people who really don't like being on the computers for a long time cause it gets boring and it starts to hurt you eyes. I will understand if they don't want to get off when it passes there bed time. Some kids do a lot of bad things out in the street and hang out in the streets a lot, but when they go on the computer it can stop some of them from doing those things. A lot of kids have myspace and facebook ... and more and it is the best way to stay in contact with your family and friends thats one of the main reasons kids go on and there is other electronic devices that stops kid from exersicing and stuff like that such as a psp go or xbox @NUM1 or ds, dsi playstation @NUM2 and @NUM3. So I think it is an addiction and it affects kids but the things you'd rather have your kids do keeps them away from doing it.",6

247,"Dear Newspaper People, I think that the effects that computers have on us are good. You should agree. One reason why you should agree is because computers are like teachers. For example, you can go on websites that teach you all kinds of things like math. Also you can go on cyber school or take college classes online. Another reason why you should agree with me is because on computers we can communicate easier. On computers, you can e-mail and use a webcam to talk to people. You can also have a facebook or myspace to chat and learn more about people. last of all, computers are for our entertainment. On computers, there are lots of games to play that are free. Also online you can watch movies and listen to music. Last, you can have fun creating games and stuff to share with everyone. Without computers we wouldn't be able to do any of those things anymore. I think that it would really suck and tons would agree with me. That is why you should agree with me that we",6
248,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern; I am writing this to let you know how I feel about the effects computers have on people. My opinion on this topic is; I think that both statements are true, yes they give people the ability to learn about faraway places & people & also allow people to talk on line with others. If we did not have computers I would not have finfished many of my school process and homeworks. But the experts who are spending too much time on thier computers & less time exercising enjoying nature & interacting with family and friends. I know this is true because I know some peopel who have gotten addicted to online video games & wouldn't leave the computer for hours & I know I myself have found new website & want to learn all about it so I'll be on the computer instead of exercising. But even with both statement being true; I do not think computers efefcet on people. Because without computers alot more students would be failing classes & getting zeros// @CAPS1's on projects; class asignments & homework. Becayse they dont have a quick way to look up all their information. Also most families or friends will lose contact because they lost a fun way to communicate. i think computers have a positive effect. Don't you?",6
249,"Almost every family has access to a computer. They have become a part of life and a way to be a part of life outside of your house, even if you have to stay at home. Computers are a source of vast knowledge from millions of sources. They have already caused exponential advancement. Overall, computers have a positive effect. on a rainy day, @NUM1 students will spend time on their computers. out of those students, @PERCENT1 will be on sites such as A.I.M.(@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3), @CAPS4, @CAPS5, or @ORGANIZATION2. Even if they can't use their phone or get out of the house, they can communicate with friends, old and new. Teens and adults use the @CAPS6 to talk in friends they haven't seen for up to @NUM2 years. People will talk to eachother more, building more relationships and better conversational skills. Over @NUM3 of the sites used by teens are based on @CAPS8 networking. To be able to easily have a conversation with someone miles away is a sign of tremendous advancement. @ORGANIZATION1 is a multi-million dollar company. @PERSON1, a for @ORGANIZATION1, says that sites like @ORGANIZATION1 have skyrocketed in popularity over the @DATE1. More and more people are putting down their @PERSON2 dictionary to type the word into @LOCATION1, where it is accompanied by a pronunciation and found more easily. Students use computers for information on school reports in @CAPS7, @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10, or @CAPS11. Information can be found in any subject. There was a survey taken to see which is used more often, books with a specific subject or computers for information or various subjects. Computers are used overwhelmingly more often. They're quicker than books and it's easier to search for a of resource an the @CAPS6. And say sight of particular interest or exceptionally usefull can be added to your favorites. Computers are more practical than books. Pictures of scientific laboratories where space shuttles are sent to the moon have @NUM4 main component computers. Adds from @ORGANIZATION3 show that they're computers are getting smaller and smaller. There's a laptop that will fit in an envelope and a handheld touch screen computer that can almost fit in your pocket. You can type papers and assignments so they're more ledgible. Computers can even score tests. Advancement is centered around computers. Before computers, so many things we do now would seem impossible. But computers open up a realm of possibilities. Typing is faster then hand-writing in some cases and papers can be saved electronically. If our country keeps advancing at the rate, than it is possible to have computers that do maindain chores such as taking out the trash or washing the dishes. There can be computers that talk bark to you like a real conversation. People can learn more and more information and personally advance in intelligence. I look at a computer and think of progress. There are points of computers that are not ideal, but overall, computers are benefitial to society. In a computer, you have access to friends old and new and information from millions of sources. Most of all, computers represent progress and advancement I see no direct harm from computers.",12
250,"Computers, a very much talked about subject. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of homes in @LOCATION1 own at least one computer. And that goes for about @PERCENT2 in @LOCATION2. Some people don't like that this is true, but on the other hand some people do. I have a computer, it can do so much, for example it can help me with writing, I can play games on it and socialize with social networking sites and ""I.M.'s"", it can even help me order a product form a website like @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION3, or @LOCATION4. Like I said, I have a computer and I can use it to help me write. At school in english, I would use my computer to help me with a writing prompt. I also use it to write conclusions for science labs. There are a lot of other kids that do this as well, it really is very helpful. That is only one of the reasons I think computers are beneficial to society. Another reason I think computers are beneficial to society is because you can play games on them, like ""world of warcraft"", ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1"", or classics like ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5"". There are millions of people that play games on the computer. Also you can socialize with social networking sites, like @CAPS6 and twitter, and also because you can ""I.M."" your friends. I.M. stands for @CAPS7 messaging, and it is kind of like email except it is just about instantaneous, and so you and friend can have a conversation over the computer. Also there is video chatting, where it is kind of like a phone except you can see the person you're talking to and it is over the computer, so it is almost like you and the person you are videochatting with are meeting face to face, but your not. A third reason I feel that computers are beneficial to society is because you can order a product over the internet form shop websites. For example, I got my @CAPS8 from @LOCATION3, and also the bulb for a @CAPS9 in my house is wearing out, so my dad is going to buy a @LOCATION1 bulb on @ORGANIZATION1. It is things like this that make life that much easier for the @CAPS10 @PERSON1, because this way these people don't have to drive to the store to buy something, that is, if they can wait a week or two for the product to arrive. These are the kinds of things that make me feel that computers are beneficial to society. I know they might not be the best reasons, but they are quite important to me. Being able to type essays, play games and socialize, and order products form websites is just amazing. These are some of the reasons that I and others love computers. But I have a question for you, why do you like or dislike computers?",10
251,"Dear local newspaper, Too much technology! Computers have a negative effect on people. First, our country needs to exercise more, and not just sit around, second, we aren't spending enough time caring for our environment. And third, we are losing the ability to communicate with the people around us. Our country has problems with being overweight. Most people blame it on fast food, but it's also because people sit around using computers, and dont think about staying in proper shape. Before computers were made, people were much more fit, and healthy, we need to help our country get back in shape, and take our attention away from the computer, for even just a short while, and we need to exercise! The next reason is that computers don't just have a bay effect on people, but our enveironment too. We spend too much time indoors with technology, and we don't even care about the world around us. Before much technology, people used to plant gardens, and trees, but now that thought hardly crosses our minds. All the electronics these days are making people forget about nature, and that needs to change. The last reason computers have a negative effect is that people dont communicate as well anymore with the people around them. If we communicate so much with people through technology, we are losing the ability to speak and communicate in person, and it ruins relationships and connections between people, like family and friends, so we need to start caring about the people around us, and not always rely on technology. In conclusion, you can see the negative effect computers have on people. We need to excercise more. Also, we need to help our environment. And lastly, we need to communcate better with friends and family. We shouldn't get rid of computers, but just step away and care about the world around you.",8
252,"@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the effects of computers are not good. Many people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising. People are on their computers so much that they dont enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with family and friends that much. I think that computers are becoming an issue. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in my school agree that they hardly exersize any more because they are always on their computers. For example, @NUM3 year old @CAPS1 used to go to the gym everyday before she got her own computer. Now every afternoon she finds herself in front of the computer monitor. If it wasn't for computers, I'm sure kids would be outside getting exersize. Computers are a serious issue. Have you ever found yourself in front of the computer screen, on a beautiful day outside? I have, and while I was on the computer I could have been outside enjoying nature. I think it would be best if you unplugged those computers for a day and just went outside and got some fresh air! If everybody keeps this habit of staying on your computers all day and not going outside, we might turn into a world of couch potatos! Im sure you dont want that. Lastly, I remember multiple times I said I would do something with my dad but I didnt because I was on the computer. Many people can agree with me. Instead of going out to interact with your friends many are just instant messaging them. The internet is amazing, but I think everyone forgot the joy of going out with friends and family. So get off those computers and call a friend. In conclusion, the effects of computers are bad. Many people are spending too much time on their computers and have less time exersising. They are on so much they dont enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with friends and family. I think after reading this you can see computers arent good.",8
253,"Dear @CAPS1, In my opinion I think we should use computers. The reason why I think we should use computers because @CAPS2 we need help on something, we can find it on the computer, also because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone, and sometimes people @MONTH1 have to go on the computer and check instant mail. Frist of all, I think we should use computers because @CAPS2 we need help on something we can find it on the computer. For example, @CAPS2 a student need help on homework they can go on google and look on the they doing and it will help. Also They can go on a website called http.historywork.com and that will also help that on what. Another reason why I think we should use computer because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone. When I say this I mean like @CAPS2 you have a computer connect with them on the computer. For example like @CAPS2 you have a gmail, facebook, yahoo or myspace you can talk to you friends at there. I do it all the time. Last reason why I that we should use computer is because sometimes @MONTH1 have to go on the for example @CAPS2 you @MONTH1 had important message the website and you message you. I do it why can't you. So yes I do their.",8
254,"In my opinion I think that computers have nothing to do with people having lack of exercise or sleep. I think it is all the persons decision to be on the computer as long as they want. The person on the computer obviously does not care if they sleep or not. When people are on the computer I think they dont play as much and start to get fat but that its their decision. Also when the time comes they going to realize that they need to spend less time on the computer and exercise. However, they need a time limit to be on the computer and limited time for eating right and exercising. Being on the computer @NUM1 people dont get the chance to interact with their family and friends because they want to be lazy and stay on the computer. The family and friends get angry and dont want to hang out anymore and within a couple of months they have no friends. Nature is good smells good, looks good, and computers make people stay inside all day! I think we should have more time outside. Also computers sometimes make kids want to not clean their room, not do chores because they are addictid to the computer.",7
255,"Some people think it is a good idea and same do not. My opinion is that, I think that people spend a lot of time for good reasons. Here are three reasons why, @NUM1. grownups working, @NUM2. students learning how to type, and @NUM3. communicating with others. My first reason is that parents do a lot of work on computer. For example, they do taxes, paperwork, airline tickets, and the bank. And those are usually all done on the computer so it would be easier if people don't drive. My second reason is students need to learn how to type so they can email or even write on paper. It helps them build learning ability and also, so they can know how to sing the @ORGANIZATION1's. Computers are suppose to be fun for people of any age. My last reason is, communicating with others is a great skill to have so you can talk in person. Computers help because if you mess up of what your trying to say then you could just erase what your trying to say. And in person, you can't. Also you can make plans with one of your friend on something if they live really far or something like that. In my opinion. I think people should be able to go on the computers to do work, playgames, no sites, and many more other things to go on, only if you have a computer at home.",7
256,"To the editor of the daily newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a negative affect on people of all ages. Computers these days are being used way too much for useage of priveleges that we already have. While people are using the computer for random activities, they are not having any physical activity. Also emailing and facebooks are great websites to communicate with but people are checking emails all the time instead paying attention to when their parents get home from a long day at work. With this people are so consumed into the computer that kids get side tracked and forget to do homeworks. Computers are great invention but with todays society there are to many issues that aren't always being appointed. In the first place, people aren't getting the exercise that they need because they are playing on the computer or video chatting with a friend. About @NUM1 of america is obess so excercising should definitely be a priority but with these new websites and activities on the computer people are getting held back. With this, kids and adults are communicating in high end ways that waste too much time. The computers have so many stupid activities that are not needed which make us not excercise because many people think that the options and webpages are important and needed. Indeed computers are a technology that is needed but people are taking advantage of it too much by having their whole life in the computer instead of having it toward other things such as excercising and being healthy. In addition to computers taking away from excerscising they are also taking time away from your family. For example, @TIME1 when my dad got home. From a long day at work no @CAPS1 truly a bear hug that he was longing for because everyone was so interested in their email or what my sisters friend just said on facebook. Family is the most important part of your life and if computers are getting in the way, computer use absolutely has to be changed. Which is more important to you, family or computers? I understand that you still talk to your family and give them hugs but when you rae talking to your sister through facebook eventhough there just in the next room. It is lobvious needs to be done. Computers affect you and everyone around you in more ways than @CAPS1. Finally, computers take away family but also schoolwork and works. Most kids spend so much time on the computer and they to do their homework. This is unexeptable and can be away, kids and teenagers are always playing games, facebooking friends and video chatting making them realize at that they need to start their home work! A girl from @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS1 time I was on facebook for the whole afternoon and then I realized I never started my @CAPS2 essay!"" This has happened to so many people because computers are too distracting and drain your brain. Moreover, yesterday I remember that I was video chatting my friend for @NUM2 hours and didn't start my homework until @NUM3! The computer evryone that goes it which is uneceptable. Without computers a negative affect people. off people exercising out with time in the computer which is unbelievable and terrible. Also they cut communication with your family making it rare to truly bond with them. With this people become glued to the computer and forget to do their homework. Overall computers are that make life that much more stressful. Thank you for listening.",10
257,"Dear editor of @LOCATION2 @CAPS1, @LOCATION3's society is being ruined, ruined by computers of course. They are so time consuming that I am afraid they are causing more people to be obease in @LOCATION3. People are afraid that they are limiting themselves from interacting @CAPS2 to @CAPS2, and spending time enjoying nature. I feel the exact same way and someone should put a stop to this! An average american goes on a computer for about @NUM1 hours a day. With going to work or school, and sleeping, that way leaves a litle @NUM2 to go out and explore nature. Our national parks @NUM3's have been decreasing in their numbers of customers at a fast rate. I visited yellow stone last week to find out if as many people have been goind. The man who works at the entrance was saying that ""since the start of @DATE1 alone about @PERCENT1 less people have been to @LOCATION1,"" I believe that the reason for that is because of computers. They limit people from goind to parks or to zoo's, by consuming the public time with all of the ""new fashion"" or the newest game on miniclip.com. Also, I believe that the public is spending so much time on computers that they are not able to go out and exersize. With the newest ""sims game,"" how are kick supposed to stay fit and healthy? I did a study on how many hour kids spend on thier computer and out of the people who said more than @NUM4 minutes. @PERCENT2 of them could legally considered obease. Is that now we want our next gerneration to be out next president and lawyers, and doctors? @CAPS8, we want them to live life to the @CAPS4 by taking care of themselves by exersizing. Computers are getting kids so consumed that is not ok. Lastly, with computers, families and friends don't really talk to each another @CAPS2 to @CAPS2, or interact with each other at all i mean sure, parents come home to thier child on the computer and give them a kiss on the head. But is that enough? I do not believe it is. I asked a friend of mine's child about how much he interacts with his family and friends? @CAPS2 to @CAPS2 he said that well since he got his new ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 with a @NUM5 gig hardrive"", he hadn't been talking to them a whole @CAPS2 to @CAPS2. However, everyday we went on ""chat"" ""for a good @NUM6 hours"", to talk to his friends. And only occasionally would he get an @CAPS7-mail or two from his asking how his days was. I do not believe that that is good in order to have good friends and a strong family life. That is what @LOCATION3 has come down to computers. They limit you from interacting to friends and family, give you less time to exersize and limit you from going out and exploring nature. Who knows, maybe at this time in @NUM7 years, @LOCATION3 will be run by computer. Do we want that, @CAPS8! so lets put a stop to it now. Thank you very much!",11
258,"Dear local newspaper, Have you ever noticed how a lot of people are always on their laptop or their computer? Well, when they're on the web they don't get exercise at all. I have three seasons why people should spend less time on their computers. People could get sick, probably forget a lot of stuff, and never have the future that they have always wanted. My first reason why people should spend less time on their computer is people could get sick. For example, their are a lot of people who just eat and eat and only use their computers. Some people get obese by doing this. When they do they go on the internet to find out how to lose weight, but they never do it. Some people go on the internet so they can have a surgery because they're so fat. They think their is a cure for obese on the internet, but the truth is that the only cure their is by doing. Some exercise because that is the only cure they will get if their not on their computer. When people are surfing the web they forget a lot of stuff. Some people almost spend their whole day or even life on their computer that they don't know what else to do, but surf the web. What I have seen happen is that some people forget where they're at or who the even are. They also forget who their family is and never contact each other at all. This isn't good people. My third and final reason is no future. Sure some people apply for jobs at home from the computer, but the only problem their is that they don't get enough exercise and paid as well as the people who work outside their house. Some people wanted to do something about their life's and how they can't because they are addicted to their computers. Some people have to go to thearapy so they can stop going on the internet. Do you want that? Getting sick, loss of memory, and no good future are three reasons why people should stop using computers and start getting some exercise. If I were addicted to my pc I wouldn't get on education and I wouldn't be writing this letter right now. Get some exercise. Together we can make a change or find a cure.",8
259,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, click, clack that the sound @ORGANIZATION2 computer keys being hit right now. Computers are everywhere these days, even in the poorest places like @LOCATION3.

Computers are our sourse @CAPS5 infromation, and time @CAPS5 liesure these days, but we are fogetting that there is a life away from them as well such as having family time, and taking walks in the beautiful, nature. To much use @ORGANIZATION2 a computer is leading to aweful health. Computers can cause many fatal problems such as seeing and vision problems, and obisity, due to the fact that you sit all day and @CAPS2't work out. Computers are like mind, and body eaters the slowly take away from you and let you cry, and weap @CAPS5 the rest @ORGANIZATION2 your life, @CAPS2't you agree? Do you know the @ORGANIZATION2 says that the second biggest leading cause @ORGANIZATION2 obisity is computer? Yes that is true! I have experinced problem. While growing up. When I was @NUM1 I was adictied to the computer. Day and night my eyes were guled to the computer screen. I had nothing on my mind except @CAPS5 computer, my mom got mad at me and yelled at me to get away from it, but I didn't. Slowly, slowly I started to put on heavy, awful faton myself, and later I found out I was over weight @CAPS5 my age. To this day I have not lost the weight I put on from using the computer, and I am sure others are to. Obesity just doesn't happen from eating to much. It also happens from not doing any cardio activities, which the computer stps us from doing. So basically the computer is unhealth. As said by @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION2 people from the state @ORGANIZATION2 @LOCATION1. Time consuming computers, are taking away family time from many family these days. Do you know that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION2 families aren't getting to spend the time with each other as the wish, reason being computers? Kids are on the computer playing games, moms finding a resipe online to make @CAPS5 dinner, and dad is buying another stock online. Yes that happens a lot, insded @ORGANIZATION2 doing those things they could be doing something else, but no computer work is more important. My family used to spend a lot @ORGANIZATION2 time together, but because @ORGANIZATION2 the computer I never get to do anything with my family now. Do you know the time health @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 say kids who spend time with their family are bound to become more better parents than who @CAPS2't spend time with family. I bet you are a really good family man/women and spend time with please take these computers away and make families come together once again. @LOCATION1 has the most beautiful nature ever, the birds, the animals, the @DATE1 times and the fall time. If anyone ever wants to see nature they should come to @LOCATION1, but the sad thing is that the people @ORGANIZATION2 @LOCATION1 aren't appriating nature themselves because they are do busy with things such as computers. I know one time we went to a comp out, and we were ready @CAPS5 nature and this boy brings his computer, and wouldn't you know it the whole got people forgot about nature and played with the boys computer. So many people missed out on the nature and the beautiful animals seen one the such as yellow @CAPS3 through that time was amazing and it is very unfortunet that many people missed out on that event. People these days are once again not apricating nature, which one day they will regret, because @ORGANIZATION2 the fact the one day you @MONTH1 not be around to enjoy this got given @CAPS2't let the computer tell you what to do lets be the boss and @CAPS5 ourself. It is now or never the decision is in your hand, make the right decision and say no to computers. Go out their enjoy nature, spend time with you family, and get healthy. Be the smart, and well educated people. (I know you are) and tell the world to not getting told by the computer @ORGANIZATION2 what you can, and cant do, be the boss control. Yes computers are fun, giving, but is bad. Say no to computers if you @CAPS2't you will regret it.",11

The first reason I think make computers good is because of the people we can meet via @CAPS2, yahoo, @ORGANIZATION1 or gmail. For instance we could meet someone from @LOCATION1 and learn about his or hers culture or beliveths. My second reason I think computers help people is because what if someone didnt have @CAPS3 or the newspaper he or she could get the @CAPS4 news via nbc.com or fox.com and will be able to still find out whats going on in the world.",6
261,"Do you think computers effect people's society? Computers help people of age first, computers let you chat with friends and family. Also, computers let you learn a lot about history. Finally, computer is a great way to keep busy. First computer is a great way to chat with friend that you havent spoke to in a long time. Also, it helps you meet new friends and to keep in touch with them in the long run. Finally the computer technologies is outstanding cause it allows you to chat with family memebers across state through video chat or even websites such as myspace, facebook and twitter. Secondly, @ORGANIZATION1 is a great way to learn about history. You can find history on almost everything from the past to the present. You can learn history about famous people places and events. That why I think the computer technologie is so outstanding what you think will happen if we didnt have today? Finally, computer is a great way to keep busy because you take the time looking up information for school projects. Also, you can spent your spare time playing games that help you learn or even book flight ticket for vacation. Finally, the technologie is here for a reason so we should use it for anything like getting up with friends or jus going on to look up information on anything you need to find out. In conclusion, I just told you why computer technologie is good to have. First, it lets you friends and family. Also, computers let you learn a lot about history. Finally, computer is a great way to keep busy. Now I just told you why @ORGANIZATION1 technologie is a good thing to have. I hope agree with my point of view.",8
262,"Since computers were invented, a colossal change in the way society functions has taken place. People how can go on to their computers to communicate with peers, get information on any topic for a school paper, or just because the internet to watch videos and stories. Magazine and newspaper articles, books and even movies and shows sre available on today's computer! This advancement in technology has made the @NUM1 century the most modern era this world has ever seen, and is beneficial to society. The ""computer age"" has given people in today's society the incredible opportunity to broaden their imaginations through technology. You can, in less than one minute go on the internet type in to @ORGANIZATION1 whatever movie or book you want and start watching instantly. People have always said that books can take you anywhere you want. Well, the computers can do the same thing, expect with greater efficiency and with more places to choosen from. You can, instead of buying a book, go online and read of the faraway city of @LOCATION1, or of the eruption of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and you can do it with mind-blowing speed. Some think that by wasting time on computers, people are using up time that could be spent studying or with family. Howeer, any information needed to your knowledge on a topic can be found on the internet. And if you want to spent time with your family, you can even look your computer up to a tv and watch a free movie with the family! The computer age is here and it is exactly. What society needs. Picture this: you're doing a school project on the you know nothing about it. Would you rather drive minutes going and thirty minutes looking withb everything you need, or do you think it's more to spend five minutes looking for the website you need on the internet? Obviously, the later of the is much more reasonable. The computer makes getting research for school or work substantially easier. In addition,you can create entire presentations on a computers with surprising ease! Being an eighth grade student, I dont know I would ever do woithout the internet. I rely on my computer to get all of my research for almost every project, and I even make some of my best project on it! The computer is the likes of all the hard working students and adults much, much easier. People's lives have not only been made easier in the field of research; computer make communicating with friends and familyeasier as well! Through e-mail, video chat and instant messaging., we can communicate with whoever we would, whenever we wort. With some computers, you can even see and talk to any person you wish. Without these computers, we will one again have to resort to snail mail, whcih makes instant communication @CAPS3 telephones, we would have no other way to talk. Computers have enhanced communication chill likes so graetly that it's foolish to say their not beneficial to society. How can a machine with so many abilities be for see the computer as a brooden research for school and we want! Bottom line the computer age is here and its amazing.",12
263,"Computors have definitely had an impact on society that changed the world. People and life are now smarter quicker, faster, and easier. People who live on opposite sides of the world can communicate in an instant, for free. But what effect does this have on people? Something this big and having such a long history can't be good for some people. I don't think for some people it is. To start with basic, some people get too obsessed with computers. If they have life problems then they @MONTH1 seek the solitude and privacy of unfiltered and limitless internet. Even if you use a computer to chat with people, it still is no replacement for the real thing. In fact, studies show that due to non posonal ways of communicating such as text messaging, email, or chat rooms, can severely restrict a pasons way of connecting with other people. Don't get me wrong here. I do use sites such as facebook to talk to people. So, I'm not going to state that online talk is bad. I think it's a very good way of keeping in touch with people you can't talk to in real life. And, it's a good way to help friends and be there for them. It's done in moderation though. Getting information from the computer is very debatable. Some could say that the people being informed is a good thing, which I agree. Some others could say that knowing too much will make our egos so big that we will be ignorant. I also agree with that. I would also say knowing some things are good, but be careful of knowing too much. One once I find computers to be great in is originallity. In a world where we are raised to kill creativity, I find computers to be part artistic. In a way. It's personally helped me to discover what kind of music, drawings, creations, etc. that I like. I can also share what I've made so everyone can see it. Or listen to it. Or try it for themselves. In conclusion, I think computers are a great tool for use in moderation. Some people who are obsessed, it can be problematic. I think they are a great addition to society though.",9
264,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In the past ten years, advances in technology have completely changed the world. Technology makes peoples lives much easier and helps keep more and more people connected throughout the world. More jobs are created and help speed up ordinary events such as taxes, messages, news, and teaching. However, many people have proven that too much use of technology can make teens and adults addicted to the internet. In this addiction many people can lose time with their family, time to exercise and enjoy nature. Since being part of the generation growing up in the new technology era, I have had a first hand experience with the benifits of the new technology. I believe that this technology is a great help to society today. Many more jobs are being created because of this technology. For example, think about how many people could be employed if a new computer system was created. There would be thousands of people working on many things such as the founder, manager, creater of new ideas or just working at the new companies retail store. Running a business or a corporation is a very difficult job to do. But because of the advances in technology, running a business can become much easier and not as much time is wasted. With the new technology, people can send emails within seconds instead of running around the entire office giving out memos. Also for businesses, their stocks of the company can be updated every minute. These advances will make easier to run and make them more efficent. With the advances in technology average people can be updated on the new around the world every minute. Also when it comes time to pay taxes, fill them out and pay on line. None the less, there is more entertainment open to everyone. Through todays new technology, peoples lives are made much easier. They can work faster, get more arrands accomplished, learn more, connect to people around the world, and be caught up with local and international news. Technology is benifiting society and will hopefully continue making life easier.",8
265,"Dear local newspaper, I strongly think we should have no more computers rather then looking on the computer. I strongly think this because this could cause serious damage to the eyes. My opinion for having computers is I don't think we should have them because you don't get enough exercise. You would just sit there looking at the computer all day. You would probley get all fat through the course of the year. You would be like a couch potato. My next opinion is we won't be able to get out of the house to see the beautiful nature. Like all the trees, flowers, wild life animals too. If you don't go outside there will be no fresh air for you. My last opinion is if we have computer. We won't be able to hang out with friends and family. You wont be able to see how big your family is. Or how small they are still small. Well these are my opinion's for having computers.",6
266,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that computers can prevent you from doing a lot of things? Instead of going on the computer you can exercise more, play outside, and spend more time with family and friends. This is why you need to spend less time on the computer. Exercise is important to your body and computers are not. you can get some weights and exercise in your room. A run out the beach doesn't sound bad either. Just by doing that you lose a lot of weight and not gaining weight on the computer. So go exercise and lose weight because it's good for you! Computers also prevent you from getting freash air and playing outside. When your are outside you see that playing is much better than just pressing buttons and clicking everywhere. On the computer. You don't even have to play outside, you can just walk with someone or just sit on the grass and talk. The computer prevents you from doing all of this fun activities outside. Spending time with your family is a huge activity that your computer is prevting you to do. You are on the computer for an hour and your family is having a barbeque. You finally get off that computer and you realize that spending time with them is so much fun than sitting down and looking at the screen. this is why computer are a distraction to everyone because you don't want to exercise, play outside, or spend time with the family. you can use the computer but just don't stay on to long because you are missing the fun.",8
267,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are beginning to be a problem in many households. I feel that too many people are becoming addicted to computers. People like this are more likely to gain weight, have little social time, and spend too much time inside. In @CAPS6 article I have recently read in the @ORGANIZATION1, it was about @CAPS6 experiment on computer use. Dr. @PERSON1, a @CAPS3 professor stated that his findings showed that people who are addicted to computers only leave their homes to run errands. When this happens, it interferes with their lives as well as their bodies, because our bodies need sunlight. Furthermore, his study also showed that people who go outside more and not on the computer as much tend to be happier. @PERCENT1 of the study's patients started to be more joyful once they stopped going on the computer as often. I like when the people around me are happy, not grouchy, don't you? I have been noticing some kids in my school that are gaining weight. These are kids who have recently started going on the computer for a couple hours at a time everyday. This is very bad for your health and body. If someone sits at their computer all day eating the food is not being worked off, so it all turn to fat. Moreover, statistics show that @PERCENT2 of all obese people in a weight loss class had gained their extra weight from sitting at the computer all day. If people treat their bodies this way, they could end up with some type of condition. Last week, @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @NUM1 intervied @NUM2 year old @PERSON2. @PERSON2's best friend has been ignoring @PERSON2 because he got a @ORGANIZATION1 computer. Now, @PERSON2's friend doesn't want to hang out with @PERSON2, or any of his other friends. In addition, when people become addicted to computers, they become less social with friends and other people like parents, teachers, and more. When people push aside their social time for computer games, chat rooms, or movie websites, they lose a large portion of their life. This can be stopped if parents put their foot down, set limits, and make kids spend more time outside. As you can clearly see, computers @MONTH1 have some benefits, but they have many disadvantages. Addicted compuer users become less social, they don't go outside and start to ""pack on the pounds."" @CAPS6 effect of this is a world full of people who sit on the computer all day eating food and gaining weight.",10
268,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The computer has been a resource we have been using for years and gives you information and pictures but that doesn't mean people have to be on it all the time. People can talk some times with other people or go on the webcam to see a loved one who's in iraq but the need to go outside to exercise just to take a walk around the block. They don't even need to leave the house all the time just excercise to a tape or get a tredmill. Thats all people need to do instead sitting on thier butts all day move around. People becoming obease has risen because of lack of excercise so grab your shoes and go jog a couple blocks in your niehbor hood just do little things and you will feel much better than you were on your computer. Nature is all around us but most people don't noice because their on the computers. Which needs to end now these beautiful land marks across the world are being wasted because hardly any ones looking at them. Go to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, even @CAPS1 and get some fresh clean air thats not from your home you can go to the park to just look at the birds just see something without a screen on it. So go got your camera and go some where with wild life and have fun. Just doing these things will help your health, energy and your mind. You can go on the computer and chat with friends but not all the time. Do you want to be unhealthy in life if not go outside and take a walk.",7
269,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think people should stop going on the computer? Well, yes because they are not getting exercise. People's body start to get lazy and don't want to get up. They are not spending time with the family instead they would like to spend their free time on the @CAPS3. This is my people should stop being lazy and have some fresh air. @CAPS2 you people who spend time on the computer interact with their family? Well, no, because they think they will get entertain by technology instead of their family. The reason I don't like compter so much because you get hook on so fast you can't stop. When you interact will family you get to know them better and that is priceless. This is why it should stop because it damage peoples minds. Another reasons I would like you to hear is less time exercising. When people don't exercise you will @CAPS2 anything to their body. They start to eat too much and later they become very lazy. When you exercise you have tons of energy to @CAPS2 anything. Like bunge jump. When you excerise you look healthy and people will notive. This why excerise is the best healthy and always fit. In addition, my third reason I would like you to read is enjoying nature. Enjoying nature you can have a good time and relax. You can swim in the beach, feel the amazing breeze, and have a good time. When you are on the computer you are sitting down instead going outside and that because a habit. It will be hurting are environment because people don't want to get up to enjoy nature. This is why it should not be tollerated because people are being lazy. In conclusion, the reason why people should not spend their life on computer because they think they will be entertain by technology instead of interacting will their family. People will start eating too much and so they will become lazy. People will never leave the house and instead they are on their computer. This is why it should stop it hurting are environment people are becoming lazy.",8
270,"My opinion on the effects of computers is that most people in the world spend most of their time sitting on the computer day in and day out. If someone I knew spent all day long on the computer I would tell him or her head on that he or she sould go out side and get some fresh air and get some exrcise. Some times the only way to make contact with them is by talking to them on the computer. Although the computer can be quit helpful by looking up important artifacts or important information about medical plans, tutorials of how to fix, make, or biuld things, and to meet new people, But, the computer can be a dangerous place as well you can meet someone who is lieing about their age that person might rape or miurder/kill you. If you spend twenty-four seven on the computer you could be paralized from lack of exercise or get lumf ophemia thats when your body a pears and will not be a to exercise and would need special treatments. Like masogise. Computers can also be good because it can give you hand eye coordination by useing the still looking sometimes some people for useing the computer: videos, video, and websites. You can get your computer uloaded for for quality. Some systems howe computers in them or can be connected to the computer like the, and the @CAPS1 @NUM1 @CAPS2. There are games called p.c. games some p.c. games comeucicate with childern to teach them how to write, read, spell, and pronounce words. There are also spiecal computers and/or web-sites you can search for tutorial for speaking different langueges. There are also sites you can search for tutorials for playing instroments. Some people use the computer to fill their emptynis inside of them inistead of eating. Some people obeuse the compeuter as a dug like they're addictied to it. Imagine someone addictied to computers every where he/she goes they would take their laptop with them. Many people have died useing the computer but thats because they obeused it. Everyday people buy computers this invention is very helpful as time goes on sciantists are makeing new things to save llives.",9
271,"Dear Local Newspaper: Are computers possitively affecting society? As technology advances, humans are relying on them more and more; most people use them daily. I believe computers effect people possitively because they help write papers, are a social tool, and are a big help with research. After reading this letter there will be no doubt that computers have a possitive effect on people in society. My first reason why computers have a possitive effect on people is they help with writing papers. Whether it is writing a resume, a science report, or a spreadsheet, none of these are ever seen nowadays done by hand. Everyone expects to see the flawlessly inked letters on the printer paper in whatever piece of writing it is. This helps the people writing the paper because writing takes many drafts to get the piece perfect; it is a pain to write each draft by hand. In additio, it is easier to read someone's writing @CAPS1 its typed, especially @CAPS1 the writer has hand writing. However, computers help in more than just writing papers. My second reason why computers passitively effect people is by being a social tool. Many websites online these days have social networks such as youtube, facebook, twitter, and myspace. In the listed websites above and many others as well, people can meet other people through other friends and games. The nice thing about meeting them online is that you don't have to plan a time to meet the person, @CAPS1 you are both online you guys can begin chatting. The chatting also helps @CAPS1 people have long-distance relationships, whether friends, mates, or family. Online chatting help people stay in-touch with someone they might not see everyday. That is a big help with everyone's social life, keeping then us ""the "" @CAPS2, online sites like eharmony or match.com take people with little time to worry about love and match them with their perfect mate. This also helps people who are shy get married and start a family. This helps people live happier lives, another possitive effect. Finally, computers possitively effect people by making research much easier. My dad always says ""You kids got it easy. @CAPS1 I was growing up, we'd to go to the library and spend hours researching before we could write our papers."" @CAPS3, its simple. Using the internet and a search engine, all you have to do is type a topic and you can get all the latest articles in just seconds. Libraries might not have the most recent books, or someone might've checked out your topic's book. Then what can you do? The internet is also an extremely useful help @CAPS1 the research topic is very specific, if its a certain becteria or species that a book @MONTH1 only briefly mention. The internet has a much broader range of articles, so it is much easier to find information for any topic. With research, taking less time to understand, people can spend more time enjoying the day, like playing outside, than in the library stressing because they cannot find a book on their topic. This is a strong reason why computers should not be seen as a negative effect on society. To conclude, computers have a possitive effect on society, because they help write papers, they are a social tool, and are a big help with research. Where would we be if we had to handwrite everything? Think about how many fewer friends or maybe even relationships we would have without social websites. What about how hours of research are @CAPS3 two clicks away? Computers have changed our lives for the better, and we should appreciate all the do for us.",11
272,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 it has been brought to my attention that why on a nice sunny day like this somebody would want to be inside. The sad truth is that too many people are wasting their time inside on their computers, rather than enjoying the day. Computers are negatively affecting the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 population. We are getting to a point where our whole world might be absolutley crazy if nothing is done about this. For one the @LOCATION1 has the most obese children in the world. Generally children should be running around burning off their calories; even some people in their teen years should. Instead kids are sitting in front of computer screens on their virtual games and emails and such. Even doing chores around the house could bring down the obesity rate a lot more then sitting on your butt staring at a screen all day. The whole screen thing brings me to my next point. Staring at those bright flashy lights for too long is not good for your brain, what computers cause @NUM1 out of @NUM2 child ceizures a year. The radioactivity in a computer could also mess you up a lot by giving you cancer, with no cure for any cancer yet you have to figure that everytime you are on that computer for too long you are putting your life at risk. The longer youre on the more and more and more radiation is going to youre brain. Do you really want to cut your life short knowing you are the one that did it to yourself, it could almost be called suicide because if youre reading this than you've been warned. So we've basically covered the effects that computers have on your body physically. The computer can also effect you mentally and socially. When @DATE1 comes along you will have all the time in the world to be on the computer but did you know over vacation you lose @PERCENT1 of everything you learned in school. Its been proven that computers cause memory loss. So what if you get back to school and you can't keep up with what's going on, frustrating isn't it? If you would've just read a book during the time you were on the computer maybe you could've gained knowledge rather than using it. Computers can affect you socially because not everybody wants to sit inside on the computer so while people are out having fun, you will be all alone, by yourself with nobody to talk to but a computer, would you like a computer to be your only friend? The debate about this topic could rage on and on for days and still have no winner but in all honesty when you go to turn on that computer think to yourself, is it really worth it? Think of everything you would lose, everything you could never get back, or would you rather do something that you would gain from in the future. Its your choice but be responsible enough to make the one that would benefit you.",9
273,"Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1 I am @NUM1 and I go to naylor school. I am writing to you convince that computers have a positive effect on people. Please read the following reasons. Computers have a positive effect on people. Your able to communicate with people all over the world. When my brother goes on the computer he get's to talk to my family in @LOCATION1 I like to use skpye because when we talk to family in @CAPS1.R we use a webcam to keep in touch with my family. They teach hand eye coordination and help me in ping-pong. It help me wacth the ball in computer and I do the same in the wreak. You have lot's of access to different information, my mom found a job in the computer. Everybody have access to weather or news, Some say it's a lack of exercise. People get addicted to the computer. Some can get obese and mess with your love life. These are the reasons why I belive computers are good for society. This is why people should agree that advance in technology. Technology keeps on upgrading.",7
274,Dear: @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3…. My name is @PERSON1 and I am concernd about people around the world are use computer is to much during the day. Some compute's are bad because there are glitche's in the computer and every one has a myspace and myspaces has a viries and it leaves a vires in your computer and your computer shut's down or goes slow. Also people can hack your computer and you cant find out about and every thing that was on your computer can go around the world. People can kno your most secread's and more. Finly you can get caught macking movies on your computer and go to jail and your business will be out.,5
275,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 is your opinion on computers? Are they good or bad? Computers, have not been around that long but it is contrivertal wiether it has a positive or negative effect. True they do help people research certain topics but they are also hazardous. I believe computer are not a neccesity to people. Computers are uneeded because people spend way to much time on them, then we begin lack exercise, and they become hazardous to everyone. First, computers are not a neccesity because people send way to much time on them. Once you are on a computer for over an hour to an hour -and-a-half the computer will start to effect you in negative ways. For one your eyes will begin to hurt. If you stay on longer than that you will start to get a head-ach. Soon your head-ach wil turn so bad you cant bare it. It will pound and feel as if its on fire. This happens because your brain cannot take in the brightness of the computer and @CAPS2 your reading or seeing at the same time. Most of the time this happens eventually you will lock yourself in time a darkroom to rest. Sometimes you don't get off till they have a stomach-ach too. After they get off and feel better they go back on to repeat the process. This is why, computer are an obstruction to us. Next, people begin to lose exercise. After being on the computer for so long all they have time to do is eat, sleep, and go to work or school. Computer have deprived everyone of the outside. They don't want to go out and get exercise and play around. Living in those conditions can only lead to one thing, obysity. Soon you will become fat. Life will become tough. And being fat also has a negative effect. For one you cannot run very long, you become weak, and for kids you stop growing. But the worst is you will not live as long as you would if you were healthy. So you see computers are a nucence to our society. Finally, computers are hazardous to the envirnment. There are @NUM1 billion people in the world. At anytime about @NUM2 billion are on some sort of electronic device. When you are on a computer, have you ever noticed the hot air blowing out of the fan. Now, have you ever thought were this heat goes. Well, it makes holes in the ozon layer and causes global warning. The ozon layer is the only thing keeping the sun's ultra-violent rays from scorting us. Now if everytime some turns on a computer @NUM3 of the ozon layer disapeared and @NUM2 billion people are on that would be @NUM2 billion mm gone from our atmosphere. Now think about global warming. If the ozon layer is like a bubble, the heat is trapped inside. So this heat will eventually heat up the earth. This will cause the @CAPS3 to melt and then the sea will rise. The @CAPS3 has enough water in it to flood the earth. Do you reall want that. Eventually we would drown and life would seece to exist. As you can see computer are a nucents. They hypnotize the young children and adults. They be helpful but more hazardous. Sometimes we don't even relize this. Computers are bad because people spent to much time on them, people lose exercise, and they are hazardous to us.",8
276,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you ever see a child on the computer for hours and nothing could get them off? Well I believe that this is very harmful for the child since it doesn't allow them to exersice, interact face to face with people or use their minds to the best of their @NUM1. The more and more we advance in society we get laziar and forget to about these essential things. I think taking a step back from using computers could benefit society more than using them. Obesity in the @LOCATION2 is at its highest @PERCENT1 of kids in the @LOCATION3 agree that they only exersice once a week and would rather spend time on the computer. Think of this, @PERCENT1 of kids. Thats more than @NUM2 of @CAPS2 children. I took the and compared it in @CAPS3 children who don't the benefit of this technology. I learned that @PERCENT1 of children there exersice only once a week. That's for less what these computers are doing to @LOCATION3 @PERCENT2 of children are overweight and @PERCENT3 of them develope heart of blood problems as adults. I by exercise in to go and play with friends or bike, or go for a jog. It doesn't sound hard does it? If we make a to spend this than on computers I think we can reduce this obesity amount and I believe @CAPS2 ran as on overall country. On the computer we have popular websites like @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7. More websites allow you interact with people over the island. This could be in more ways than one. These computer websites are allowing anyone to talk in people who could have the interest in mind. More than @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people in my school say they have one of these accounts and have personal posted on them. With this personal info, could and with these websites the crime rate has gone up @PERCENT4. Also, these websites cause people to their social skills. People spend hours on these websites talking to people and forget how to talk face to face. @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 students say they would say something online that they wouldn't say to someone's face. This creates more problems in schools and could possibly make someone hurt someone else or themselves. I've heard all over the news about suicides and because of computers and I believe with less of them people would spend more time with their family and or nation would be closer and safer. Computers dont allow you to explore nature and use your mind to the best of its ability. Computers make it easy and I myself, think it makes me laziar because it allow me to read a book there or read about other people, instead of going to a library and getting a book. Computers take away time to actually use your mind and problem solve in real life solution. There's years and I've learned I can be on the computer for hours playing them and not realize it at all. Without them, would make a difference. Kids are living through computers and we can change them.",10
277,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I have been informed that recently, people are questioning the use of computers. Some say computers have negative effects on people when using them but I for one disagree with that statement. I believe that computers in today's society have created an atmosphere of learning, communication, and an ideal amount of creative fun. Computers are changing the way everyday people live. This technology is the basis of our future, and our future has evolved around our computers. People learn so they can become better at things, be aware of what is going on, and to gain the knowledge that possibly help mem succed in life. Computers gona access to information that people want to know whether it is to learn how it dance using youtube.com, to learn about a possible vacation spot your family might visit, or to research a topic for a school paper: computers have it all. It sits right at home so there is no need to drive to the library and wait for a book with the right researching skills, almost anybody can find the exact information they are looking for. Computers contribute to people who want to learn. Being a popular used computer have beenimportant to make them the best. Whether that means faster internet better, researching book or more websites, a computer has it all. Back before the telephones was invented, people struggled to have a reliable source of communications with where communication is important because it is the main source of communicating. Through the computer, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and emails are easy and guarenteed ways to talk to everybody. With just a simple click of a mouse a person can talk to their bestfriend as if they were right next to them. Communication plays an important role for a civilization or society. It makes life so much easier without creating a place where people become lazy. Talking to people by using the computer has become easier and more dependable than ever. People can email their teachers if they have a question for homework, people can check there grades online, and people can talk to their friends and family all they want whenever they want. So we people say that the computer. If a sibling is away at college, their @CAPS3, when a family is to gether, they could since new things are discovered through the computer everyday. can come to a person in multiple ways. A computer can emphazize the fun is never a bad thing. Computers offer video games, learning games, and that bring creativity to. This technology gets people every to have an open mind with everything. It allows them to have fun but at the same time learn something about the world or even themselves. Sometimes computers can inspire people to do something like start a group to make the environment better or go running around ther block. Even though the actual computer is inside the fun and creativity can be whenever a person wants it to be. Computers expand a person's knowledge, allow one to communicate, and create a whole new word of fun. Researching topics can be easily accessed through a computer. Communicating with others makes life easier and having fun while inspiring people everywhere makes computers have a total positive effect on people. It creates a new atmosphere of enjoyment of different things. Computers effect people in the greatest way and I don't know why some people doubt its magnificent ways of indudging people in the environment.",10
278,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a child of the tech generation, or the generation in which technology has taken on a new meaning. That meaning is life. Our life revolves around technology in general as the @LOCATION3 revolves around the sun. The chief technological preference, computers, is greatly beneficial, aren’t as bad as many people speculate, and help us live and prosper in this struggling world. Look, if you want to roast computers then by all means, roast away. But if you do so without first regarding all the angles of them, then you, my friend, have absolutely no standing on the situation. You could say that they are a neucence but could never have used aho. You could argue that they can be used to detonate bombs, but, lets be practical, how many normal people actually wake upwake up and point out the drearyness of life and then type in a command to detonate a bomb? A serious benefit you have obviously choes t o overlook is the invaluable information it aptly places in front of you on a @NUM1 inch screen. You can read book reviews, read books, bag things, and get the cutting-edge news you want, to name just a meager amount of possible strengths. Further more, not everything that you speculate as bad has to be bad just because you say it so. When you think of @CAPS3. Do you always think about vulgar, inappropriate pictures, and illegal images? That’s funny, because @CAPS3 keeps family in touch, gives people things to do, and keeps friends in different states on the same server. Youtube is not all swearing and bad videos. My family casts actors for shows, and one way they know what an actor is capable of is by going to their channel and looking at the videos that they have created. My mother actually contacts actors in videos to see if they want to become professionals. That is the business, finding talent where it is seldom found. Lastly, did you even think about the fact that computers are used to start companys and saves lives? You probably didn’t even know that, from a computer, astrologists monitor images of the universe captured by the hubble space carrier meteorologists track cloud formations from satellites using a computer. Maybe you didn’t choose to say that surgeons can dictate operations from their office in @LOCATION1 on a patient in @LOCATION2? You didn’t even say that seismologist use computers to traet the shifting of the tectonic plates to see where the epicenter of a major earthquake is? You just didn’t know. So, let’s face it, computers are important. You probably used to do what little research you did them. In fact, pardon me. You probably didn’t do the research in the first place, instead pointing fingers at the innocent. Smooth move, buddy.",11
279,"Many people say that computer is help them in their every day life. A few examples are you could learn about places you didn't know about by searching on google. You get facts reviews about the place. You are exercising your fingers. It helps with communicating with other people. It can help you find long lost family. It reunites lots of family & friends you might have been looking for. Also with hand & eye coordination. And that means you can write/type without having to look at other features that cames through with a computer is going online. You can look & browse at things available in a store. Without driving all the way to the store & wasting gas & polluting the air. I.Ms a way of finding what's happening world wide & breaking news. You can still interact with family & friends & can meet new people. There's e-mail, instant messaging & much more. So you can always interact with & if they dont have a account signing up is. If you just go into nature you don't know what's there. You could look it up and find out what the park has to offer. And that concludes my opinion on how computers are helpful & lots of diverse ways.",6
280,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches them hand-eye coordination, the ability to learn about people and places and allows for people to entertain themselves. As I said before computers are very useful for the advances of hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is very important in our current world because in order to play sports and type effectively you must have hand-eye coordination. When I was a boy of @NUM1 years I had survey low hand-eye coordination skills and my playing suffered because of it. Now after a couple yours of playing online my baseball, lacrosse and basketball skills have improved from playing online and practicing. Also my typing has gone up from @NUM2 words-per-minute. In @NUM3 words-per-minute. Allowing me to write reports faste and allow more time for revision. But the internet also allow me to search the web to make the aspect of my report go much faster... Though out people needed to suport their opinions and. Now the internet for a person to such to find facts relating to their topic. This bad of help can male school projects easier, make students be even smaller and give opportunity to help in need. As I got ready @NUM4 while my position paper this year. I realized I needed @NUM1 usually this would be difficult but with the help of computers, research can be made a whats let easier. Secondly, I learned so much while my @CAPS1 @CAPS2, like for example don't really pick the president. The votes they gave actually elect a spesculative to go to the @CAPS2 to. Finally, as the earthquake in @LOCATION1 I was able to donate through the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 website. These examples show how important the internal to learn about people and places, maybe give a helping hand. Finally, the last great thing about the internet and computers is that you can entertain yourself through online games and movies. My mom is always telling me I should ways to myself without dragging her into playing catch with me the internet and computers allow me to play online gones by myself. Secondly, movies on computers can be a real time if you want to around. These are the reasons why I believe computers are important for improving eye-hand coordination, learning about different people and places, and the ability entertain you self. Though my opinion will only count to myself I hope you will to stress the importance of computers in your future articles.",10
281,"Dear, local newpaper @CAPS1 it's true technology is blinding everyone. More and more people are being sucked into electronics and less people are caring about our planet. Their are so many great things out there that could be put at risk. People @MONTH1 say that if you spend allot of time on the computer they would be able to find cure's for the deseases out there. Those are just lies to stay lasy and waste their life on the computer. What is going to happen to all of the sports in the world. The players are going to get old and they will retire and if no one is going to take their place then the games would be cancled. I am a big fan of football and I don't want to see it ge cancled. Some of my friends are saying they are addicted to the computer and I always hope they get out of that habit because what's going to happen when they get older they are going to need a @CAPS2. If they stay addicted they won't want a @CAPS2 and they what they won't have money, they can't pay bills, and they would lose their house. Why do people say they could find cures for things by looking on the computer we all know that's not true. They need to learn about them first not by just looking on the computer. They @MONTH1 not want to but they would have to look in books and do some heavey thinking before they can find the cures. I hope the ways of life change really fast because things can get really bad. If we do stop this way of life then things could get better and then our planet @CAPS3 will stay around longer and we could make the a better place.",8
282,"Computers today are much different from computers back then. They help you with projects or homework but many experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers. I think that computers help people in many ways, like teaching a hand-eye coordination. They're useful because people can talk to friends and family members that they haven't seen in a long time and computer skills are required in the real world. Hand-eye coordination is very important and using a computer can help people build up the coordination. This helps because if one has to type a @NUM1-page report, then one who has good hand-eye coordination, or typing skills, ""can finish a report in @NUM2 minutes or so. If one has poor hand-eye coordination, well that @NUM2 minute report will take about a few hours. No one likes to be sitting infront of a computer for a few hours. Everyone has friends and best friends that they talk to every day, But what happens if that friend moves out-of-town, out-of-state or possibility out-of-country? They might be forgotten or never seen from again. Well, thanks to technology and the advancement of computers, people can chat online on @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messaging, myspace or facebook. They can catch upon things, check out what's new, even see posted pictures of them. The same thing can be applied to family members who have moved away. Who wouldn't want to talk to friends or family that haven't been heard from? Lastly, having computer skills is very, very, very important in the real world. Skilled people who have a good knowledge of the computer world can get great jobs like a computer programer for the state, or they can create websites for their own jobs. Other jobs people with computer experience can have would be an editor of movies or @CAPS2 shows. That's big money there. No wonder schools have computer classes. It's to get students to have a good background of the computer. Computers are not that bad. They teach hand-eye coordination, lets people talk to other people online and can get people great jobs. Many educated people would agree that computers doesn't have a positive effect on people.",9
283,"Dear local newspaper, I feel that the people using computers benefits our society. I feel this way because computers give people the ability to learn about far away places: and people have educational websites, and even allow people to talk online with other people. First of all computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. When I was in sixth grade I had to do a project on @ORGANIZATION1 didn't know anything about him. But, luckily we have computers so I was able to @ORGANIZATION2 on a computer and found a wodd or information on him and got an a plus on the project. Also, when I was in fourth grade I had to do a project on @LOCATION1. I went on a computer went on @CAPS1.com a get lots of imformation and got on a plus. The second reason computers are benefitial to the society is because computers have educational websites. Computer technologist @PERSON1 saids, ""@CAPS2 percent of the computers websites are educational. I also remember when i was in seventh grade the whole class went on @CAPS3. com and were able to learn math and have fun at the same time. Last but not the least, computers allow people to talk with other people from around the world. Theres a website calle myspace.com and it allows me and other people to talk online around the world. I asked my class and ninety percent of them go on myspace.com. On the other hand the computer does have cons. Some kids go on unprohibited websites that are not for minors. Theres a website called @NUM1.com and it has shooting and killing games that are not for kids. Also, some people are computer addicts who stay on computers almost twenty four seven. Now, you know my reasons, why computers are good to the society, they give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, have educational websites, and even allow people to tlak to other people online. What is your choice in these actions. ",8
284,"@ORGANIZATION2, Technology has developed majorly these past decades. It has helped mankind so much from buildings to new inventions. These is how ever a growing concern about whether it's beneficital or not? People become more lazier because of the many things you could do with it. I think that it benefits us all. We have learned many things from it. The computer shows what man kind is capable of doing. We can learn about many cultures with it. Students use it for studying and making projects look better. I asked @CAPS1 @PERSON3 of @ORGANIZATION1 about the concren. He says that is can expand our knowledge. There is concern about how much paper we lose every year. With computers it makes going green more possible. You can make powerpoints on the computers instead of using so much paper for long essay. We could do tests on computers. I think the future will be based everything on computers. You can email instead of using letters. For example my friend @PERSON2 said her school didn't use paper and uses computers. They saved money and paper because of powerpoints etc. I miss my family over at @LOCATION1. I want to see them. Not just by talking on the phone. I use the computer to talk to them basically have. I asked @NUM1 people if they perfer using computer to talk to there family or use a phone. @NUM2 out of @NUM1 said they perfer computer. I know I'm trying to they are great but they do have there down side. The games are horrible for the computer. People will just play and play all day long. Online for the games make it even more fun thus it make them lazier. There are so many games for the computer it's horrible says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION3. In conclusion, computers will be something that will help us for a long time and it benefits us. Except the fact about the games I agree with that bad side. I hope I have shown you as an independent person my statement was true.",8

286,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do you think is the best technology made so far? Computer! They are the best technology because you can do anything on the computer. My friends say computers are one @ORGANIZATION1 the best technology because the internet can help a lot @ORGANIZATION1 things like if you have research paper. Research has proven that computers are a positive effect on people. My mom says computers are one @ORGANIZATION1 the most hardiest tools in the world. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 my friends say that computers are one @ORGANIZATION1 the best because you can get help from the internet on homework assignments. They say that for people to talk online with other people. They said that they can interact with family members who live far away. They also said that on being on the computer has taking more teens @ORGANIZATION1 the streets and in their homes. Dr. @ORGANIZATION1 has done extensive research and has proven that being on the computer teaches you hand-eye cordination. Another thing he has proven is since computers has been invented the violence rate has gone down because more people spend time at home on their computers rather than out on the streets. He also proven that since people have started schools the success in school grades has gone way up. He thinks they have gone up because, instead @ORGANIZATION1 students reading long boring article on someone or something they can just search it on the internet. He said using the internet also saves more time. My mother syas when she was younger the computer gave her the ability to learn about far away places. My mother said that the internet would also let you learn about people customs rather than reading books because some books have not yet been upgraded and you would want to learn about their newest customs also. My mom thinks that using computer is a posotive effect on the world. @CAPS1 you are doing a fine job at writing at your job. My friends say computers are helpful, research has proven that computers have dropped the percentage at violence down, my also thinks that the computers is a posotive effect on us. I know you will agree with me when I say that having computers has put a powerful effect on people it gives people an easier time in life.",8

People like to kno",5
288,"Dear newspaper and readers of @LOCATION1, I am @PERSON1, a student from @ORGANIZATION1, I have recently been enformed about the argument over computer use and I feel it is silly. We need computers in life to help us do jobs, communicate with family or friends traveling the world, and for research on homework. First of all, without computers many people would struggle. My father uses a computer for his job and he couldn't do his job without one. Sure, many people spend way to much time on their computer, but other people use it to save information or find research. I know people argue that computers should be used less, but could you get through a week without using one computer? Most people couldn't, especially if you own a buisness. In addition, from using computers for jobs, some people like to chat online with a friend that move away. Imagine if your family member or friend traveled constantly and they went to places where they couldn't get connection on their cell phone, the only way to talk to them is chating through the web. I'm sure everyone has used a computer once to talk to a friend or for something related to buisness, so they are more useful than people relize. Lastly, as a kid we need to be able to use a computer, not just to talk to friends but for homework. Some homework requires us to make powerpoints, write a paper on historical facts, and we need computers to do so. Without computers, kids wouldn't be able to gather facts or information to write a paper. Decreasing computer use for kids can potentialy bring down their grades. My teacher always says, ""grades are the most imfortant thing."" I'm sure all parents would agree with that. All in all, we can't decrease the use of computers because it can do damage to peoples lives. Think about people who travel alot, kids with work that needs to be done, and parents with jobs that they need computers for, don't upset all of these people by decreasing computer time. Thank you for your time,",9
289,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that having a computer is a very positive. I know that teenagers are on the computer a lot, but if it really bother the parents, why do they have computers in their houses? @CAPS3, I can tell you @NUM1 reason why. They are good sources of information, its a good way to talk with your friends and it gives you information about places that you might not know about. Primarily, I would like to say that computer are a fantastic source of information. They can tell you anything! This is also helpful because if you are working on a project, and your mom cant you to get books at library, then there you go! A computer is just a simpler way to look up information. Did you know, that @PERCENT1 of parents who got their family a computer do not regret their desicion? Thats almost all the parents in @LOCATION2! @CAPS6 as you can see, it would help kids with whatever they are studying. Secondly, we teenagers today use computers to talk with our friends @ORGANIZATION1 email @CAPS3, I think this is alot better than sending @CAPS4! Why would you wait letter from your cousin @LOCATION1. When you can talk to them in seconds! And it do paper if you just @CAPS5 to buy I would like to say that having like this one time, I was work my we were looking for a hotel to stay in when we went to we ended up finding a great hotel, for a cheap You can also go on map guest if you @CAPS5 to someone. @CAPS6 for all the people out there who dont computers are important have would you to In conclusion, I think that having a computeer is a very important thing for @NUM1 reson they are very good book source they help us communicate with friends and for every information on for @CAPS6 imleaving the opinion with you hopefully you will learn something than better and pick the right ",9

Your fingers will get muscle and will teach you to remember where to type without looking down on the keyboard.

The typing does all the work for you so you won't spend hours writing to someone. Computers are helpful to people for example, ir your researching about @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1 you can find almost all the information on the computer in a instant click.

291,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 computers were invented they have grown so much, which make a lot @ORGANIZATION1 people use them more. More and More people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who suffort advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people, but there are negative effects too. I believe that computers are a negative effect on people vecause people spend too much time on computer; not exercising, there are many dangers, and less interacting with family and friends. First @ORGANIZATION1 all, a negative effect computers have on people is that they spend too much time on the computer and that leads to less exercise. Recently, @CAPS3 spoke to a local @CAPS2 about this issue and she spoke out, @CAPS3 have one family computer and my son is the one who is always on it right after school to late at night."" This shows that many children are on a computer too much. I have to input that I personally sit on my computer at times and not even realize two hours past. I try to cut back on my computer times, but it doesn't really work out. Sitting on the computer for hours everyday is also looking exercise. The hours used up on the computer could be the time in which you are exercising. someone's health is very important now. Spending too much time on the computer and not getting exercise is a major negative effect computers have on people. Secondly, the most concern parents have @ORGANIZATION1 computers are the many dangers, which is another negative effect it has on people. Recently the new biggest site is facebook. So many people are addicted to it. Though, it isn't that safe all the time. Another new thing is oovoo or skype, which allows you to talk to someone with webcam. There could be a time when a teen ""meets"" someone on-line and agree to do things on the webcam for someone they don't really know to see. These sites aren't safe, and knowing youngs they can in danger. @CAPS3 spoke to some researchers about this and they would agree that these sites are @PERCENT1 dangerous to young teens. All these dangerous risks as another negative effect computers have on people. Lastly, another negative effect computers have on people is there is less interactions with family and friends. Instead @ORGANIZATION1 getting together with a friend people just go on the computer to talk. That isn't the same as an actual get together. I actually enjoy family parties. Seeing all my aunts, uncles, and cousins it so much better and fun. I do e-mail my family and friends when I don't see them, but I get excited when @CAPS3 have get togethers. Now a day it's not like that for a lot @ORGANIZATION1 people. Many people work long times and spend too much time on the computer, which takes time away from interacting with others, and that should be more important. The computer also, negatively effects people with interacting with family and friends. In conclusion, I see computers as a negative effect on people. Computers make people spend a lot @ORGANIZATION1 time have dangerous risks, and take away interaction time. I strongly suggest you look over my terms.""",10

Third reason is ahopping if a holiday is coming up you could check online and find stuff for cheap and nice to you.

Many engineers strive to improve on technologic devices popularity, while others use it in communicate or relax. study conducted by @ORGANIZATION2 university, the computer is the most largely operated machine. The computer positively contributes to our education, economy, and entertainment. As i mentioned before the computer is beneficial to our education. An example of this is the school i attend, middle school. Here at we have over @NUM1 computers in use throughout the school day. These computers help the students complete research papers, typed assignments and other teacher requirement papers. By using the computer to complete research papers students save hours of scanning through books in the library and money on reading books. In addition, computers teachers in organizing files and entering grades online so students can check their. This is beneficial considering the amount of and assignments graded each week. Moreover, a computer called the ""parent portal"" allows the students to stay connected with school events that would not be mentioned otherwise in all, computer are way of.

294,"Dear @CITY1 current I am writing to you on the issue about people spending to much time on computers and not able to spend time with other people like family, friends and others. Also people are getting information off of the computer which is a good thing for important paper that you might have to do or collage essay to get in to that collage. Another reason is that people are truning a bit lazy and not getting to enjoy exerising and getting to get some freish air. To more on I will explain what I mean about being with family and friends. For example let's say that your friends are planing on going to yhis huge beach party that every one is going to. So you tell your friends to pick you up but beofre they come you go on the computer talk to some you know and your friends come to your house to pick you up but you are not  for them they pass on by you don't go go to school next day there talking about you miss the party. SO that is any story , it might seen long so, I'm shorting the next part which is the information on computer. Foe example lets say that you  doing on  paper you  . Just need youre more . You find a place you go on find good write come down yet of of the computer finish paper get grade that is good feel happy the end. So that is the only good end of the reason why computres are good. For some  reason some people went to stay inside on the computer but other go outside on a good warm day. So what is your reason myspace, facebook other its good if you talk to other people bad if all you worried about if your pics are good, what matters is there you need to be haapy. I think  done all I could. So thoses are my reason why computer are good and bad  for reasch bad because of nooding to exericis and need to be with friends ",7
295,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I believe that there is more and more controvosy about computer and whether they benefit society or not. In my opinion, computers are a wonderful resource that will soon become a household item. I am writing to persuade you that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe computers are a good thing because they allow people access to more knowledge, they allow people to stay in contact with people they dont see very often, and they allow people to keep up and know whats going on in modern life. One reason computers are useful is that they allow people to stay in contact with people they don't see very often. Today, parents don't mind sending their children off to college as much because they can actually see them using video chat websites like @ORGANIZATION1. This feature on computers has a big impact on the life of people today. People in @LOCATION1 can talk with people in @LOCATION2. This type of often allows for people to share new and inventive things they've discovered. Another reason computers can be useful is because they help people keep in touch with modern life. Many companies are now erasing newspaper ads and putting them all on computer websites. Some companies are only selling items on their websites and shipping them to the buyers. With computers students can also get their homework done and send it to their teacher by email if they cannot make it to school that day. There is even at home colleges now where you take your class online. I believe that in a few years from now more and more people will do business with computers and more stores will sell online only. Finally the last reason I believe computers are a good idea is that they allow people access to more knowledge with the internet. There are websites soldy devoted to history and information on many things. Also there are blogging websites where people can debate on information or get questions answired by real people who @MONTH1 know a lot about the topic. Another thing on computers that helps you get informed is websites like wikipedia where people can search a topic, read history about it, and follow links to other websites if they want to pick apart the topic even more. Overall, I believe that computers area a great resource to human kind and will be used for more and more things in a few years. I believe computers are useful because they allow people access to more knowledge, the ability to keep in touch with others, and to keep in touch with modern life. I believe that in a couple years there will be liss stores on the streets and most will be online because it is much cheaper for the companies. So, most people in a couple years will be computers and use them effectively.",9
296,"Dear @CAPS1, In my own opinion, computers do not have a positive effect on people. Online, you can go on any website and talk to people. Most of the time, you @MONTH1 not even know who it is your speaking with. Plus not all information you @MONTH1 find is true. Computers also take time away from doing something productive, like playing outside. In the next few pragraphs, I'll show you my point. First off, online websites have many different ways to contact people (chat rooms, blogs, email etc.) @CAPS2, do you really know if the people you're talking to are who they say they are? Back then, it was rare someone got caught when trying to kidnap a child by pretending to be someone online; @CAPS3 a days more and more people are getting caught. You @MONTH1 think this won't happen to your child, but my friend was being stalked online by someone what they haven't caught. We never thought something like that would happen, @CAPS2 it did. Also, once it's online it never goes away. So watch what you put online, there is always some way to find what you had posted even once deleted. Plus not every bit of information found online is ture. I professionals say that @PERCENT1 of kids have researched a project online then used a print source and found that information to be false. On websites like wikipedia any one has the ability to change what is written on the page. Most websites @PERCENT2 give the ability for anyone to do so. Also post and pictures on the internet @MONTH1 not always be appropriate. There's certain criteria we keep children from seeing for a reson. Lastly, computers keep you from doing anything productive. It @MONTH1 teach hand-eye coordination however it does not keep you fit and healthy. Already, @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 alone are over weight and that's alot of people. Dr. @DR1 says that online games keep kids from getting much needed exsersize and fresh air, that every growing child needs. In conclusion the internet keeps children from going outside to play. Also, not everything found is what is true or right. Lastly, not everyone you find is the person they portray themselves. This is why I think that comperters aren't positive in society.",10
297,"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I believe that computers do benefit society. People are able to read, shop, and play online. This makes life easier for many people. Buying books that you would like to read can get expensive. With the internet, people are able to read almost any book right on their computer. In a recent survey, it was found that people who read books online save an additional @MONEY1 a year more than people who buy books. People can also read things like newspaper online. If there is snow on the ground, and people are unable to get their newspaper, they can read it online. This way they will know if a newspaper is still good, and continue buying it, including the @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. Additionally, people are able to shop online. Sometime, someone @MONTH1 have been an accident injuring them, and they are stuck at home. If it is a child, their parents will be unable to go to the store because they will be caring for the child. They can simply go on the computer and have food and other necessities delivered to them. People can also do this if they have a busy lifestyle with work or school. @PERSON1, a physician, told me that people who shop online have @PERCENT1 less stress than people who go to the store for the same items. He said that is is because they do not need to worry about taking much time out of their schedule to shop. Moreover, the computer is a good way to quictly play games. Young children can be very loud and energetic. Parents can just let them play games and read on the computer. Little kids love just the fact of being on the computer, and letting them go on can keep quiet and occupied for a while. Even just typing is interesting for younger kids. For older kids, there are many games that can play. Action, strategy, puzzles, and many more. They can also play against people around the world. The computer is fun for everyone. So in conclusion the computer is a very good place to go shopping, read books, and play games. Computers greatly help families of today.",9
298,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I understand that more and more people use computers, and that can have a good side and a bad one. Do you go on the computer for hours every day? That could be bad. I believe computers are good thing, but only if they are used properly. Hopefully when I'm done, you'll see where I'm coming from on this matters. Everyone is on the computer these days. The problem is, many people are on way too much. They say they are working on hand-eye coordination, but in reality they are wasting away their lives on a chair. They do not communicate as much with the rest of the household and that does not make a big, happy family. They say they are getting important information, but in truth, they might just be getting false information and viruses. Bad people are out there, and one might hack into your computer and ruin your day. Things like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 could have people that want to find out all about you so they can hurt you. Yes, being on the computer definitely has a bad side. But there is a good side as well. That is, as long as you are not on too much. It does improve hand-eye coordination, if you play the right games. And it can teach you things, too. Many websites have true information about place or things so you don't need to see it to know about it. You can be helpful. It is also an easy way to purchase items. You can just order them. Most importantly, you can have fun. So, what is your side on this argument? Do you think way too many people are on the computer. Or do you think computers can be great, as long as you're careful? I, for one, pick the latter one. What about you?",8
299,"Computers are today a common havar hold item and some people think its bad for socity when in reality its our most useful tool nowadays. It supply's an easy access to information along with preparing skills for future generations. And giving from lifes sometimes to cruel days through gamming. Before computers world spend hours in books and find what there looking for. The computer solves this. This non as simple as typing what ou need to know and hiting the enter key. This improves grades for children and life for adult solving a into the without leving your home and allowing news like yourself to spread into at the moment it's known. It also creates an interactive place for anyone in the world with thing like and or question and answers this allows us not only yo ask opinions and compare responses but to get statistics that @MONTH1 help us make life altering decions. Not only it supply info it also prepare our for the world. With things like children around the world and I social and decion making skills. It also them like web and design as well as simplier things like management and tougher things like business. Along with all that though it gives love an copy. Online video gaming is today a huge maker in which allows people not only for new as they do anything from dance, build, fight, smithe teilor, and so. And this infact @NUM1 of games are ages @NUM2. It also improves at the same time hand eye cordination. So when you have a ruff day tents to brings people happyness. So computers all neccity and put your mind to hard work but @MONTH1 you your dreams with a little well limit!!",10
300,"I walked into my living room one night and saw my mom on the computer. I thought to myself ""she is always on that computer, doesn't she work to do?"". I said to my mom ""I think we should have an hour two of the computer each night, or not have one at all."" I told her that I think computers are a bad choice because you don't know who is on the internet and is trying to talk to you. Also, it gets in the way of exercising and spending time with family and friends. The internet/computers are very dangerous now a days. You never know if someone is a friend or a predator trying to get you. Say if you were talking to someone and you thought it was your friend, well you don't know for sure if it is then or not. I could be an older man or women trying to get a hold of you so they can probably kidnap you. Steal from you and worse. Now I watch the news and see many kidnapping because kids are talking to people on the internet and don't know who they are or what they look like. Like, when a girl was talking to a man and she thought it was her friend, turns out it wasn't and she got in a whole lot trouble. Maybe if she met him she would have gotten very hurt and be scared of that memory for the rest of her life. Family is very important to most families now a days. I have heard that spending time with family would bring your grades up in school because as you talk to them, you learn new things. Sadly this is not happening because people are so isolated to their computers they don't spend one minute with family or friends. I have a friend who is always on the computer. She never spends time with her family or friends. She is so focused on the computer screen then what is going on around her. Recently she has been getting off the computer and making more time with family and friends. Even her grades started going up because she spending more time studying with her mom and dad, then being on.... for example @CAPS1 or myspace and not getting any work done for school. In other words, she is very happy in life now and has changed from this experience she has gone through. Most people think you can use your brain for knowledge and call it exercise. That is one way to put it but it is not exercise for your body. People have spent more time having their eyes glue to the computer screen that they don't go out and play or maybe go a gym. The rate of obecity in our country is increasing for many reasons and lack of exercise is one of them because people spend to much time watching tv and being on the computer. I have a little cousin who is over weight and should be out playing sports and exercising. But does she, ""no""... She spends her free time on the computer in a stuffy room, instead of getting fresh air from outside. She keeps asking me how did I get and what age, and I keep telling her, I exercise and play sports so I can't tell you when. I keep saying that to her but she never listens. To this day she is still the same because she didn't take my advice to get off the computer and go outside to play. I strongly agree that we should have only two hours of the computer each night or have no computers at all. For kids saftey from bad people out there in the world, spending time with family and friends and finally for exercise and to stay fit with our bodies. I hope people understand what I say and take action to persue them in they own life and convice others too.",9
301,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I rencently started researching the effects that computers have on people an have found some shocking facts. I do not belive computers benefit society at all. Three reasons why I believe this is because it makes people lack exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends @CAPS1 is a rising problem in @LOCATION1 and a major factor towards @CAPS1 is computers. In fact statics so that people who spend more time exercising than looking at electronics all day actully live longer lives. So my first reason about why computers do not benfit society is that it lets people lack exercise. People need exercise to live and with computers it is becoming more lacking than ever. Also, exercise give you interfines a not more that makes you happy if you live your life exercising instead of watching or doing violant things on the web that will lead to a less violant future. My second reason is that computers cause a lack of enjoying nature. Nature is a beautiful thing filled with simmering lakes, the beautiful scent of balsam fine, and thosands of creatures. With computers thoshands of kids are missing out on the fresh air and adventures that nature has in store. My parents didn't have computers when they were little and they say that they enjoyed running around their neighborhoods playing sports and other fun activities. Finally, computers lack in interacting with friends. Remember when you were little and you called up your friend to hang out and sleepover, well now computers have caused people not to have to call or hang out with friends. Instead you can just @CAPS2 or email them and @CAPS3 you can have a conversation without even looking at a person! In closing, computers cause a lack in exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends. Please help and encourage others to help me put a stop to computers! Thank you for your time and I hope you learned some shocking and interesting facts from this letter. ",8
302,"Dear @CAPS1, I belive that people are spending to much time one computors. I belive this and I have @CAPS7 reasons why. @CAPS2 first reason is that people waste money on it. Also every thing they get from the computer you get from book. And finaly @CAPS2 reason is because of the ""@CAPS8 crises."" @CAPS2 first reason for say that people spend to much time on the computer is that people waste two much money on it. I belive this because of your electric bill and and @CAPS3 bill. The people who have computer electric bill is always very high and for reason they are forced to pay @NUM1 or more dollars on electricity. This is also true becuse of the constant charging of laptops or running of computors. Also they have to pay @NUM2 and odd dollars on the @CAPS3 bill to keep the @CAPS3 connection. So that bocome a total of @NUM3 and odd dollars going down the dawn. @CAPS2 second reason for this is that anything and every thing you can get on the @CAPS3 you can get from books. I belive this because where do you think the website makers get there info from. Reading books also increase your knoledge so that at any time you can quickly come up with an answer. Another reason is that some website are not always accurate with their information. @CAPS2 third and final reason for this is that we are all dealing with this ""@CAPS8 crisis."" @CAPS7 people every day are getting less and less active because of computers. This I cause less people to be phisicaly active and less fit. And the @LOCATION1 is suffering because of it. Less and less people are joining the army because of this crises and computor are sadly con triputing to the world wide crisis. I eagerly hope that @CAPS2 letter hase helped you see @CAPS2 point of view on this subject. To show that people spend to much time on there computer because its a waste of money, anything you can get from a computor you can get from book, and because of the ""@CAPS8 crisis"".",8
303,"There are all kinds of computers, but they all do the same thing. Computers help people with anything they need. Such as, you can go online and chat with people, you can buy and sell things, you can go to college, you can learn anything, and it helps you type up your homework neatly. I personally think that computers are very helpful and we are lucky to have them. Going online can give you so many opportunities for anything. From going to college online when you don't have the time to go in person to just talking to your friends. You can learn just about anything on the computer and it's just so much fun. The computer to most people I know is the greatest invention besides the obvious ones. Going to college online is so easy. There isn't alot to it. Alot of people in the country online for college. For instance, parents that want to go back but can't go in person or someone who has alot of work but cant fit in the time to actually go to college. But they can go online and take classes on their free time. Also, talking to friends online is fun too. When you arent at a friends house you can chat with them online. Maybe you can go on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 or even your email. There are many ways to do it on tha fabulous computer. The computer is also jam-packed with loads of information that is helpful to anyone in the world. You can learn about different countries, people, or even the recipe of apple pic. Who knows what you can learn. The computer has things for every person in the world. Since we are all different. Some of us like to buy or sell things on the computer or do our homework. Maybe even just a fun computer game is nice. Every person in the world is different, but we have one thing in common. The world knows we need computers and computers are the smartest thing since the calculator. Buying and selling things on the computer is easier than it looks. All you have to do is put what you want to sell online or look online what you want to buy. Then you buy it or sell it. There is more to the process like the @ORGANIZATION1 people bring or take it to or away from you. But that just the basics. You can also do your homework neatly on the computer if you have a messy handwriting. Therefore, the computer has so many things that can benefit you and the world with everything it has to offer.",8
304,"Dear Local Newspaper, In my opinion they take time away from exercising. Also, no one has time to enjoy nature. Of course, when it comes to family and friends, The time is stified by the computer. If more people get of @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, I'm positive all would be resolved. I'm sure that the computer is affecting everyone negatively. Obesity is a huge problem in @LOCATION1. One in five children are obese. I feel the computers is contributing to the problem. I remember times when I wanted to go outside and exercise, but the computer dragged me away wih all the fun games and videos the internet sure, the computers fine in moderation, but many people abuse their privellages. Obesity leads to many such as dogged arteries or strokes. No parents wants to see their go through young. But if from of to fix it? taking away for many. Everybody these dayrace people have so much effort making. I's sure I would have had across time if went people have probably done. Good times. Family to take time from away from us. In conclusion, I feel the computer is an addiction. Millions who on the computer gain weight. Also, it takes time enjoy nature but the computer blocking the way. Another thing the comuter puts family and friends on hold. Memories are being stolen by the awful device that computer. So else how bad the computer is.",6
305,"Due to an on going debattle about weither or not computers benefit society I am writing to you to inform you of my opinion on this mater. I believe that computers have more of a benefit than they do a draw back. I believe this because. First of all, computer bring about online communication. Also computers advance and enhance learning, had to mention that computers advance emloyment. As I mentioned, computers bring about online communications. Now after reading this there must be one side running thru your head define this well online communication, include social networkinjg sites litre facebook and twitter and not to forget my space. This also includes email and blogs and some chat sites. Okay enough of that But how do these things inventions iprove our lives. These inventions allow long distance communication bringing people ""closer together."" @CAPS1 example, my uncle lives in @LOCATION1. And thru facebook, my mother can speak with him any time she wishes and over from their relatives. So online communication @MONTH1 be very nessary @CAPS1 same. Also you could use email to communicate with others although it travels slower than other of electronic communication. Besides, I mentioned learinig. Computers can improve learning in a variety of ways. Computers improve learning because they speed the flow of information to the students can go to such places and a school websites to findout more on a particular occuring at the school. @CAPS1 example, I go on my school's website to retreve nightly homewrok assignments and read the next day's daily annocments. Teachers might post helpfel hints on homework and @MONTH1 a detailed explanation of the assignment. Also computers can improve learning by assiting with research projects @CAPS1 example a couple of weeks ago my health class was information car our illegal drug project. So with the information, made of wide variety of brouchers from it.",9
306,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 being able to find the information of anything with only one hand. Computers benefit people because the can talk online with others. Also people have the advantage of learning about faraway places. Lastly you are able to find lots of information quickly and easily. Computers do benefit society. Furthermore, with computures people can talk online with others easily. All @ORGANIZATION1 students use the computer daily to video chat with friends or instant message parents! @ORGANIZATION2 discovered that computers keep families closer because they are able to see each other virtualy when someone is away. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 use their computers to talk with others online. One could see why computers are bad, but @CAPS5 they benefit a lot of people everyday. @CAPS1 walking into a room where people of all are learning about computers are helpful to @CAPS6 individual because the can learn about places. Computer says ""Computers are information in a compact "" @CAPS3 out of @CAPS4 people use the computer learn about far away places. The @LOCATION1 lives had found that using the computer to learn about far away places than using multiple , Some can use why books are to use, @CAPS5 omputers are. Lastly, computers are great because they teach @CAPS6 to have better, @PERCENT2 of people found their after using the computer for one haour. @PERSON2, @PERSON1, says ""The computer can help to develope stronger reflexes."" @CAPS6 could see why computer slow reflexes, but @CAPS5 they mae them better. Computers benefit society greatly. Computers help people talk online with others. Also people can learn about faraway places. Lastly the computer strengthens hand eye coordination",8
307,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The age of the computer is upon us. Every where you go, you will see people with laptops or other portable computer devices. While some people dislike the world's large usage of the computer, I happen to disagree, I feel that the computer is a great @CAPS5 to put out and find information. I also feel that it is good @CAPS5 for people to communicate with ther family and friends who live far away. Lastly, I think that computers provide us with fun activities, entertainment, and a @CAPS5 to relax. What do you do when you want to know what the capital of @LOCATION3 is? You either go break out the old atlas, or, with a simple click of a button on the computer, discover that the capital is @LOCATION4. My point is that with computers, finding information is fast and easy. Also, with computers you can share information as well as receive it. Lets say that you are not a doctor but have discovered a cure for the common cold by using iteams find in everyone's households. What do you do? Well, you could go to the media and do interview after confrence after interview, or, you could simply post it on the @CAPS1. It is plain to see that the computer in an important not in the process of exchanging information. ""I'm sorry @PERSON2, but we can't fly out to @LOCATION1 to see @CAPS2 @PERSON1. We don't have enough money."" I think that everyone has heard a variation of that line at least once. But here comes the computer to the rescue! With computers @CAPS2 @PERSON1 over in @LOCATION2 level is just a click (and or screen) away. By using webcams, you can speak with someone across the world without having to worry about the expensive costs of flights! No webcam? No problem! You can send someone very far away a message through e-mail or instant messaging. Say ""bye"" to expensive phre rides, long phone bills, or years going by seeing a loved one. Computers are,not just tools that are used strictly for, computers can be used for purposes as weel. In other words, computers can be used for fun! How exactly does the make computers have a creative on society? I'll tell you how. Many @CAPS4 are workaholics, also known as people who warr @CAPS5 to much. After a long day of signing papers and fiddling with a budget, wouldn't it be nice to just sit down and play some solitare? Thats possible with a computer, and you don't even need a deck of cards! Computers are full of fun games, like solitare and chess. These games are a great @CAPS5 to help people relax, and trust me, everyone needs relaxation. Having some downtime can really help someone to be a healthier and happier person! Aren't computers great? They can let us to exchange information talk to family and friendss across the globe(without a big pore tag), and they provide us with entertainment. So everyone out there could does not like the effect of the computers have on the public, please reconsider. Computers really are a helpful, fun, and useful tool to society.",9
308,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you belive that the advances in our technology are not good for our society you must be misunderstanding computers have a positive affect on the people in our community by giving us well hand and eye coordination and giving us the ability to seek and find information to learn. It can also allow people to communicate online with others. Hand and eye coordination is an important thing that helps us everyday. @CAPS2 new technology such as computers, can help us with that skill, we should use it. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""Computers do help us a lot; almost @PERCENT1 of active computer users do improve their hand and eye coordination just by using the computers for a small amount of time everyday."" @CAPS3 and education are essential, especially now; the more you learn, the better salary you get.

Gaining valuable @CAPS3 online doesn't just go for adults but children as well. @CAPS2 they have a report on @CAPS5 or need some help on their homework, these new technologies are one of the most effective, fastest ways to learn and find information. @PERSON2, a doctor that specializes in @CAPS6 emotions/feelings says in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 last month that, ""in this new millenium, preteens and teenagers simply love the new advances in technology, and @CAPS2 we want them to learn, then we can take this tool and have them use it."" Computers are also a great way to communciate it's fast and easy. I have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1, and we rarely get to see each other due to the distance, som we catch up by messaging each other by social netwroks or emails. It's even free, unlike the costly long distance calls. The communication is also great for businesses. A company can reach out and contact their customers to reschedule an appointment, give receipts, advertist and many other things. Computers are essential and effective techorlogy that are use by people around the country and world. They improve hand-eye coordination, allow people to gain @CAPS3 and education, and gives people opportunity to communicate with others. this is another great and useful step in our communities around the world.",10
309,"Dear Newspaper, Computers benefit society because they teach people. They are also helpful because they solve problem that humans might have trouble with.

310,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 my opinion on this is that people do use computer's a lot! Some people don’t care about exercising, or enjoying nature, maybe people dont even have friends so they spent a lot of there time on the computer because they have no life or maybe they just go on websites that are addictive. For example @CAPS2.com, people/kids have one of those? They chat with friends or maybe even boyfriends. Enyways thats my opinion. Another opinion is that I think people should not spend most of there time on the computer. I think that because people should be having fun, socializing with people, and living there life! So this is what I I think, my opinion about ""Computers"".",6
311,"I think the effects of the computer are bad, these are my three reasons why I think its bad; @CAPS1, the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time or hours on their computers, @CAPS2, people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computers, @CAPS3, people need to use computers out a less time. These are the three reasons why I think the effects of the computer are bad. The @CAPS1 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that computer could cause couse blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computers because the screen of the computer has too much light, people can't just stop staring at the monitor and even worse they could probably lost their sight and they will end up with blindness. That's why you have to be away from the screen but, being too long on your computer is bad. This is my @CAPS1 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad because the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computers. The @CAPS2 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computers because when people are on their computers too much time they just couldn't come down stairs talk with their family of friends, they could'nt go outside and enjoy the glory of nature and the enjoyment at the outside world, and also if they had nothing they can just read a book, draw, watch the @CAPS4, etc. They could do those things rather than wasting their time on their computers. This is my @CAPS2 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computers. The last reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that people need to use their computer for a less time because when people use their computer for a less time it is good because now they finally could be with their family and friends and spend so much time with them. It also good to saving energy, and prevent you from paying alot of electrical bill, and also it is good to finally let your vision of the eyes to relax. In conclusion, the three reasons; @CAPS1, the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computer. @CAPS2, people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computer, and @CAPS3, people need to use their computers for a less time will prove that the effects of the computer I think its very bad.",8
312,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that using computers will benefit us in many ways like talking and becoming friends will others through websites like facebook and mysace. Using computers can help us find coordibates, locations, and able ourselfs to millions of information. Also computers will benefit us by helping with jobs as in planning a house plan and typing a @NUM1 page report for one of our jobs in less than writing it. Now lets go into the wonder world of technology. Using a computer will help us in life by talking or making friends on line. Many people have myspace, facebooks, aim, these all benefit us by having conversations with one another. Many people believe computers are bad but how can you make friends if you can never talk to them? I am very fortunate for having a computer that can help with not only school work but my social life and how I make friends. Computers help us with finding our locations, coordibates and millions of information online. If we didn't go on the internet a lot we wouldn't know how to go onto websites that @MONTH1 help us with locations and coordinates like @LOCATION1. Would you rather use a computer or be in @LOCATION3. When your supposed to be vacationing in @LOCATION2. Million of information is found on the internet.

314,Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 i think it it good and bad. The good is it teaches people about @CAPS1 places and how other people live in there soicty what they do to get food or how they raise there kids. It also help people like cops. Because the have a person there looking for they have the computer to look on. It also help cops as in a speeder they can see it her or she have done it befor. It helps teaches to get a lesson or line to teach or they will put you on line to help you with your typeing. Yes it dose have a positive effect on some people. So people think they do a lot better around the computer or they do there best work online. Like say a high school paper. Yes you can talk to other people online get @CAPS1 friends. On the other hand computers can be bad as in you meet people online you don't know who that person is or where they come from. They might have a long crimal. They might be some on want to get you in troble because of his or her family problems. Some people spend to much time on the computer because they meet some one they rally like and don't worry about what the family want to do. So people use to work out every day but now they can talk to they friend all night and all day they stop and forget about it and never start agine. Some people just stay in the and stay on the computer got playing baceball or football or going to family reunions.,7
315,"Dear @CAPS1: you recently posed a question in you Newspaper. The @CAPS2 yourk @CAPS3, asking if the readers were for or against technology. I support computers because they give one opportunity to learn about different people all over the world and their culture, they save massive ammounts of time in today's hustle-bustle society, and you can talk to people online via certain computer programs. With a computer one can learn scores of information about foreign countries and their culture. I read an article in the @CAPS4 @CAPS3 about a man who was participating in a church program in which a foreign citizan would come to @LOCATION2 for a while to make friends and learn about the @LOCATION1. This man, @PERSON1, was assigned a from the farms of @CAPS6 who had never been out of the fields. @PERSON1 thought @CAPS13 would be nice to welcome her in his house with a familiar setting. Unfortunatley, he knew nothing about @CAPS6. he did have a computer though which he quickly retreated to so he could learn everything about her home. When the woman stepped into his door, @CAPS8 was eastastic to feel like @CAPS8 was home again. @CAPS8 ended up staying with @PERSON1 and getting married. If he had not charmed her with his knowledge from the computer. @CAPS8 might not have stayed and had a wonderful life with him. Also, @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION2 says that language students such as spanish and french have @PERCENT1 higher success rate if they have a computer to learn more about the countries. He says the average grade for kids with a computer is an A. but the average grade for kids @CAPS15 a computer is a @CAPS9+. Therefore, having a computer to learn about faraway places and people can ensure happiness and succes in the future. Computer also save a massive ammount of time. In the school Newspaper, @PERSON6 told about her homework problem. ""@CAPS10 night i had @CAPS11 homework. I had vocals @CAPS8 is a galore to deal with. I had to look up @CAPS10 word in the huge dictionary, I was failing @CAPS11 because i just didn't have the time for my homework! Then my family bought me a computer, @CAPS13 was so nice using the online dictionary. I could finish my homework in @NUM1 minutes compared to @NUM2 hours! I was finally doing well in @CAPS11."" @CAPS15 her computer, @PERSON6 would have to have and @CAPS11 @NUM2. @CAPS8 would have just kept failing @CAPS15 her time-saving computer. ALso, @PERSON3 says that @PERCENT2 of people get to work faster when they look up traffic reports on the computer instead of listening in the radio. He says that @PERCENT3 of people get a because their boss is so impressed with their consistent timing. As you can see, time is a valuable thing which computers can help save. Finally, computer allow one to talk online. A student once had the misfortune to break one of his vertabrae. The doctor told him that he would not be able to participate in school for a. The student, @PERSON5, came up with a plan to speak to his teachers via his laptop and webcam. Everyday, the teachers would give @PERSON5 an update over his computer. When he finally marched back into school, @PERSON5 barely had any work to make up because his teacher bad interacted with him over the computer. @CAPS15 his computer, @PERSON5 would have a month's worth of work and learning to make up which would have been overwhelming. Also, @PERSON4 of @ORGANIZATION1 says that students that communicate with their families during college have better relationshops after college. Obviously, being able to talk to some are over the computer is a useful thing to have. In conclusion, having a family computer is a very good thing. Not only does @CAPS13 allow people to learn about places other than their home, @CAPS13 also gives us more time and allow us to talk to other withour ever leaving the comfort on home. I recommend that everyone who wants an easier life should invest in a computer.",12
316,"Many people think computers are bad or that we spend less time outside because of them. But are they are bad for individuals to use as people say they are. In this instance, a moderation would be helpful. When you think of computers, what comes to mind. Games? Social @CAPS1? What if computers are doing more than that? Last year, a computer helped diagnose a concussion of mine and helped figure out I've had @NUM1 others. Not to mention the computer did quicker and more efficient than a regular human. An expert says ""Computers diagnose anything, not just concussions, @PERCENT1 better than doctors."" @CAPS2 the social netwowrking has a positive aspect. This has let people, who haven't seen each other for a long time, reconnect and become good friends again. With the positive aspects there is always a negative. Computer have started to make kids obese. This is problem in the country because if we become lazy then we could ruin our country. In addition, if we become has reliant of computers @NUM2 diagnos, what happens when they get faulty? These are problems that are very real and aren't being with. If we cant deal with these problems first then computers will turn out to be a bad thing. Lastly, a moderation could be extremely helpful for us today. For example, instead of using social @CAPS1 for friends next door, go outside and play wiffle ball with them. Social @CAPS1 was made to reconnect with friends far away, not across the street. @CAPS2, instead of totally reling on computers to diagnose problems, have them and the doctor find out. Doing this will get great results and keep doctors prepared if computers, dont work. These are just a examples how moderation could be very helpful to everyone. In conclusion, having no computers wouldn't be a great idea because of how much they help society. Although, being totally dependent on them is a bad idea to because they don't have that much benefit to them.",8
317,"Do you like computers? Do you use the internet to help you? Do you use it every day? Well @CAPS1 not this article gives you information about all of this. First, alot of people don't like computers because they say ther're to confusing. Actually computers are'nt that hard to work you just have to be patient and take some time to get used to it. Also, computers can make things easier like typing. why should you right @CAPS1 you have the option to use a computer which lets you write faster than you could on normal paper. Secondly the internet is very easier then books. All you have to do is go to @ORGANIZATION1 any other search engine type what your looking for in and in a split second you have all the information in the world on that topic. Also @CAPS1 your planing a vacation the internet can help. You can purchase plane tickets online and sometimes there are special discounts doing the web. Also, you can back hotels and look at live pictures with more than just . So when you back a vacation on the internet you know it will be a good one. Finally, you can purchase anything with a click of a button. Almost every website has discounts. I remeber the time when I bought @MONEY1 shoes @MONEY2 online. Also it usually ships to your house in a couple of days . Lastly going on it alot isn't bad. I go oh the computer almost every day but also go outside too. I can do this because at night when one one can go outside I go on the computer for school or for fun. Also, you can talk to your friends or family over the internet. What @CAPS1 your mom or dad wnet on a @NUM1 weeks buisiness trip. You could use your webcam and talk to them and see than like @CAPS1 you were in the same room. So is going on the computer really so bad? I don't think so @CAPS1 it is that helpful and easy to work with.",9
318,"Dear Local newspaper, I agree that computers have an effect on people. It helps people learn hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn a far places and you can talk online with other people. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. As @CAPS1 grow up, they learn about letters of the alphabet and spelling. There are many online programs that teach @CAPS1 how to type. Once the @CAPS1 get in learning how to type, they end up typing fast. Computers help @CAPS1 of future learn & with all these learning websites, @CAPS1 will be able ti teach them solves new things. Isn't it a blessing to be able to meet people from a far? You'll get ot learn there cultures. Would you want to know something about? They make daily go around, there you'll you? Well its so learning a new culture is a faster way of making friends. Have you connect. Oneday i will people who dont just want to be friends, maybe more than that. Be positive about online chatting, or online dating services. As you can see for my reasons above, the computer has an effect on people. The computer teaches you hand-eye coordination, it also gives you the ability to learn afar places & people, and it allows you to chat with other online people. Make sure you stay positive & be safe on the computers.",9
319,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer? Of course you @CAPS1, that's where you get all the information you need. Computers are good and everyone should have one. The computers let you learn new things and you can search anything you want to know. It also lets you communicate with your family, friends, or other people you need to communicate with. It can also let you see disasters in other countries and teach you about the world. Computers are good and benefit a lot of people in these ways. Computers can allow you to learn new things and search up anything you want to know. If you're in school and you need to @CAPS1 research, well there you go, you have a computer to help you. This is also good for jobs. Any one can use them and learn new things at the same time. It let's you @CAPS1 work, learn new things, and it's fast and easy to @CAPS1. You don't have to @CAPS1 all that hard work of looking for a book and spending so much time looking for the information you need. Computers are great and you should use it. Another great thing about them is that you can communicate with them. If you have family or friends that live far away or in another country, then you can communicate them by computers. You can easily webcam with them or e-mail. This is very easy and this way you can stay close to them. This is also good if you @CAPS1 business online. You can @CAPS1 your job and talk to the people you need to talk to. If you ever have to arrange on emergency meeting and don't have time to call the people you need to, then simply send them an e-mail and your set for the meeting the next day and so are they. This is a perfect way for communication and business. My final reason for computers is that they are perfect to learn about disasters in other countries. If you ever miss the news and you really wanted to see them, then you can go on your computer and see the news and learn new things and see what bad things have happened. Also if you live some where that isn't your home town, then you can go online and see what is going on at your hometown and visit for any special occassions. You can learn a lot of new things about other countries. Also you can learn about new places if you ever want to move to another country. You can see hotels or anything you want to if you want to go on vacation. This is a perfect way for transportation and learn new things about other places. In conclusion to all of my facts, computers are good. It lets you learn new things and @CAPS1 research. Also, it lets you communicate with family, of friends in case of emergencies. Computers are also great if you want to go on vacation or learn new things about other countries. If you have a computer, then that is great. If you don't then you better go out and get one because these computers are awesome and can @CAPS1 just about anything you need. Stop waiting and get online or go out and buy one.",9
320,"Dear @LOCATION1, Have you ever found yourself thinking about the computer, or wishing you were on it? I heard you were looking to see if computers have negitive or positive effects on society. I feel that it is a negative effect because of less time exercising littele time with family or friends, and is very it's easy to became addicted to. Exercising, a very important thing for a healthy body and mind @CAPS1 have a hard enough time finding time to do this. So instead of that free time to exercise, they will probably be on facebook. Also the maintenance of the computer will take away time for exercising. Just @DATE1, my computer got a virus I had to get fixed and that took for ever. That time while I fixed it could have been valiuble exercising time. Another key point to look at is obesity. We should be up and moving not just setting and staring at a computer for @NUM1 hours at a time. I love to spend time with my friends and family. I mean who doesn't right? Computers only away from that kids well be on facebook instant of eating a nice meal with thier family. My @CAPS2 always told me stays of the (and stupid) things he @CAPS2 with his friend. Now wkids just @CAPS3 easy. We will never have the social our parents I feel if is very important to spend time with and family because you never find when your going to lose them. Addiction is a serious matter. being addicted to the computer is too. Our generation is so dependant on computers. For example, in the car with the @CAPS4. You just plug it in and it ells you where go. What happens when it braker? You will have know idea where to go because you never learned how to read a map. or what if your computer brakes? You will have to send a better by mail kids had be typing instead of writing. that skill would be lost and you would have to learn it again. As you can see, addition is a no laughing matter. Once again I must streach the negative affect of computers to. ",8
321,"In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",9
322,The effects of computers to people are that adults and kids are getting way more attention then they need to. The first reason why is that most spend their time social networking. The others are either buying things or playing games. Some of the people that are on the computers are wasting too much time being tech-saavy. It's other ways people can spend their time like biking or taking a brisk walk. Another solution is you can get up on you learning skills or find a job around you town. Computers drain and waste peoples minds everyday. I think it is essential for the people that can't get off seek fitness and mental health. Than again it could be legitimate reasons to be on the computers spending as much time as you want. The people that abuse the access of their computer too much should think and find something else to do. I think it'll be a good idea to have a time when the computers should be shut off one day or a week. By that I mean the cable/enternet company should turn the internet and the cable off for a week of pure exercise. That'll make people who are lazy to do something active. It'll also be a good motivator for people who are on the computer or watching t.v too much. Then it would make everybody fit and health if they try. I understand the elderly or senior citizens who need their computers for health help. That's understandable but everyone else should not be exempt. Computers and laptops should be network disconnected to make people get off their feet and do something helpful or brain building. Everyday people are being digitally sucked in. Some people in this world just can't get enough of it and it need to dead soon. The government should make a legal law that you must do something that will actively benefit you. It should be a person of the state or local towns person that goes to every house. Another way that could be done is by one person from every street in the state go home-to-home to make sure the procedure is being done. A lot of people are not going to like it and they will not obey the new law. It should be a penalty towards anyone that fails to abide by it. The second choice should be a loss of internet services. That'll make them really mad and in exchange they should still exercise. Sometimes it takes harsh laws to make somebody change.,8
323,I think having a computer is good because you can research stuff and you can meet people and chat with them. Computers are important to society because it helps keep track of info like doctor appointments and crimnal records for police to follow by. having a computer is a good but if you spend to much time on it you will hurt you eyes. Having a computer can help you talk to friends who have moved and have website that they can talk to you on like myspce or facebook or even yahoo chat. When having a computer its very helpful in life and can help you in a lot of areas. Computers can also cause problems like spending to much time on it and not getting enough sleep for school. Having a computer can also be bad because sitting to close or spending to much time can hurt your eyes and cause you to wear glasses. The way i look at it as i see is that to much is bad so i think spending some time on it is good do you agree?,6
324,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opion in thig is that, computer are used all the time. People use them to talk to friends and family online. People also use computers for home work online. And the last rason I say computer are used is just for fun stuff game you can play. I use the computer to look how @CAPS2 teams are doing. Now on to more about why. Computers are good for society, because people use computers to talk to friends and family on @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. This is a good reson becuase we all have family. So I think that this is a good way to talk to them. An for friends this is a good way because if they move you can talk to them on this. The reson it a bad thing is because people like older men can use the computer for child pornarapy and talk to younger girls about sex and thats not right. Now on to more about using computer for homework. The reson computers are good to us is because people can use there computers for homework. This is good because if you need to do something on our history then that what thats good for this is good because everything you need is on a computer. Now on to more about how computer are good to society. @CAPS2 @CAPS8 reson is because computer are good for fun stuff. Computer can have every game you want they have kid games, @CAPS2 @NUM1 year old sister goes on to the games that you can match. Teenagers can play games on the computer. The compter for me is cool because I can see how @CAPS2 football team is doing. Ho @CAPS2 @CAPS7 are doing. This is why the computer are good. These are @CAPS2 opion on this is that compter are used all the time peopl use them to talk to frend and family online. Peope also use computer for homework. Finally last and @CAPS8 reson is because you can use it for fun games for kids. An I can check how @CAPS2 teams are doing. ",8
325,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 much time do you spend on the computer daily, @NUM1 hour, @NUM2 hours. While computers, are amazing advances in technology they are also very bad for you. People spend hours at at time on the computer causing less time exercing, horrible speaking, and dangerous searches. From @DATE2 to @DATE3 the numbers of obese people increased from @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION2 citizens to @PERCENT1. In a recent study the amount of families with computers is now @NUM3 out of @DATE1 compared to the @NUM4 out of @DATE1 in @DATE4. Scientist wonder if they were connected and relized they were. People who spent hours on the computer live a sedentary life style. They are more likly to go on the computer than go exercise. The lack of exercising causes obeseity, and cardovascular problems. Without this valuable exercise more people are . At a visit to the hospitial a surgen said he has seen a huge increase of heart surgreys in the @DATE1. We found that the computer manual booklets says to only go on for an @NUM1 hour at a time. The hottest thing online these days is social networking, whether @CAPS6's twitter, or facebook. These social networking allow teens to talk with there friends. But @CAPS6 really isn't talking. For example they write @CAPS3 @CAPS4 going @NUM2 dance. Not only is the spelling wrong but also the grammer. And this language doesnt just stay online, @CAPS6 is now now they talk. @PERSON1 the grandmother to a social networking said, ""I can't even have conversations with her because she is is talking like she is on the computer. @CAPS6's so sad."" @CAPS5 for public speaking and english class, @PERSON2 an english teacher for @NUM7 @DATE1 states @CAPS2 she has seen a drop in teens ability to write gramaticly correct and @CAPS2 when she corrects essay the are written is social networking form. ""@CAPS6's hard to see litiature dissolving because kid are spending so much time on the computer. The average day for children in @LOCATION1 @CAPS7 is to go home and going on the computer for hours at a time until a parent comes home. @CAPS2 would you like your child to be surfing the internent alone without you for hours when you don't know what they are doing. Parent blockers can only do so much. Children can find out the password and net around @CAPS6. The dangers are always there. You can get a lot of good information on the internet but you can also get a lot of bad information. You dont know what your child is searching or who they are talking to on the computer, @CAPS6 could be ""@CAPS8,"" the who lives four blocks over.",9
326,"The amount of computer usage has been significantly growing over the years. Adults and children are spending huge amounts of their time on computers. Though these divices @MONTH1 seem entertaining and helpfull. Well that is not all true. Computers are being used for more then just work. It seems to be the peoples new way of comunication. Communicating with others has always been a great part of our lives. There is not a person in the world who has not had some form of communication with others. Though computers seem to abuse the privlage of communication. For talking on an online chat sight is easier and more convient for people. The people in those charts are not always sho they claim to be. This pushes a huge danger on those signts @CAPS3 children of all ages now are using them. These children fo not always know who they are talking to, but @CAPS3 its online they say anything that into their mind. The way @CAPS2 talk tao people in person is not the same on line. When communicating with people on the computer the writer tends to short hand things. Such as the word ""you"" would be spelled ""u"". These quick changes happen without thinking, and become a natural habit. These changes quickly become a part of our communication and writing. So instead of seeing the sentence ""@CAPS1 did you think about her project"", @CAPS2 will see ""wat did u tink bout her pro."" @CAPS3 of this many childrens grades could be affected. For their spelling will soon become and the vocabulary will be, or all in slang. This vocabulary change could be prevented if computer were not used as much. Today @CAPS2 are seeing going outside. No one ever needs to go anywhere if all theire communication can be done at home. This isn't just hurting ourselves but also the environment. The less time people spend outside the more energy is being wasted. The times @CAPS2 do go outside is for simple tasks such as taking out the trash. This is hurting our environment! There are not as many people taking care of our planet. People are not taking the to make a garden, plant some tree's or simply pick up some trash on the side of the road. If @CAPS2 would all just take the time, maybe only ten minutes adays to help our environment it would be helping our bodies and also helping our planet. This would reduce the amount of people using computer's and change the way @CAPS2 see our civilization today. So please help yourselves and the earth stop talking on the computers and get out and do something productive. The computer will always be there, but @CAPS2 only have one of us and one ofour planet. @CAPS2 dont want to destroy these over a simple piece of technology.",11
327,"Dear @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 people believe that computors are harmful to our society because people spend more time on such technology. I believe that this is not the reason our society is falling today although I agree that people spend to much time on the computor. Computors are actually helpful in our society because it is an advance in communication. People have found ways to communicate with other people through plugging in a web cam and mic. Not only does the computor help communication but it also helps us gain information on modern day society like the news to stay up-to-date. This complicated device can also save files and documents by typing them in so that if it is lost you could just reprint it out. One main thing that people of modern day technology usually do is talk to faraway friends and family on spare time. Legal websites allow people to be informed of a friend or family about events that have ocurred like an incident or an up coming event. @CAPS2 experts like @PERSON1, who specializes in the behavior of people, says that this is a number one cause of obeisity and prevents people from meeting other people outside or even plain exercise. I would say this isn't completely true because before even talking to anyone. Online people usually go for a jog around the neighborhood. Information is vital in our society and keeps us up-to-date on modern life. A computor can give us certain information like news and whether report. These days every smart person would go search information on a computor for not only missed news but for future forecast on whether to plan a picnic. This would be a helpful tool to our society in order to keep up with the world and not miss the latest event. I believe this is an advance in our modern day society because you could get the information you need. When you are in a rush to go to work don't you end up losing papers and files just forgetting about them? The computor can send data to a computor to conviently copy a file or document so you won't have to rush to work and worry about lost files. It has been known that thirty out of fifty people have saved themselves from losing a job from a computor. The computor can also hold and store data for later use like a song or picture. You could send that file and listen to it on another computor. Now is the time to decide if you should support computors. The computor can help you talk to long lost friends of one touch of a button. If you need certain information than you could find it on a computor without ever leaving your comfortable home. last and not least you could hold important files and documents and save yourself the trouble from rushing to work. So go and type that letter to a representative to help people see that computors are good for our society.",10
328,"Dear @CAPS1, In a recent poll it was determined that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have used or come in contact with computers. @PERCENT2 of those said @CAPS2 use computers daily, and not just for work. This extensive use of technology creates a lack in their exercising habits, @CAPS4, they enjoy nature much less. Furthermore, people spend less time interacting with family and friends. These are demaging effects on our society. ""The biggest reason why people dont exercise, "" says health proffessor @PERSON1, ""is because they just don't have time."" This problem can be directly attributed to the statistic that on average, @CAPS2 spend @NUM1 and a half hours a day on the computer. You can argue that they @MONTH1 be learning new things or broadening their horizons. However, none or which help these people get or stay healthy and in shape. Being on the computer does no good for the body. Click the next link and watch as a beautiful humming bird swarms across the screen of your desktop. You can clearly see its wonder, but can you feel it? Can you smell the fresh air it flies around? The computer can only show you nature, but you must log off and find it for yourself to truly appreciate it firsthand. Society will only cheat itself of the world's splendor while watching it on screen. Fans of computers will argue that they help you interact with people around the world, but what about the people in the next room? Computers @MONTH1 bring you to people globally, but distance you from people at your job, school or home. As humans, they need contact with the outside world. Why limit themselves to typing to people, when they can talk to them? In conclusion, extensive computer use does not benefit society. People will spend less time staying active. More over, people will enjoy nature on a desktop instead of in person. Finally, society will not spend as much time communicating with family and friends in person. The time has come to take a stance. It should be clear that computers are a danger to society.",10
329,"Dear local @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people have been using computers for years. But @CAPS3 it good for there health. Were not thinking about what power teens have with the internet. If you need info. We have lots of great books. If we need communication we have phones. We need to go outside and exercise. @CAPS3 the computer another reason why america @CAPS3 becoming obese? First, teens can do harmful stuff on the internet to themselves or others. People have invented facebook and myspace. Almost every teen in america has a facebook. Did you know that theres cyberbullying now. People have humiliated others on the internet. How do we know that the person were talking to @CAPS3 who he/she say's he/she @CAPS3? Teens give away to much info of themselves, some have gone missing from such an action. The internet @CAPS3 a powerful weapon, but can teens handle this kind of power? Next, although the computer @CAPS3 a convient device. @CAPS3 it not true that we have something called books. We cant believe everything that @CAPS3 said on the computer . We can get all that we need and more off of books. People lived in the middle ages without computers, but with books. Why can we. Have we grown lazy to do such a thing as to get up and look through a book. Finaly, if communication we seek, then why not a simple text or call. we go through all the trouble of turning on and opening pages just to chat online. We have become lazy because of device's that have all we need in our homes. sure its a good thing but dont forget a bad one to. It seems like the computer @CAPS3 another reason for america growing obese. We need to get up walk, hang out with friends, do sports. But how can we when were adicted to computers. It's like a powerful drug. To conclude I think computers are not good for us. Teens with the power of facebook. Fake and dangerous info when we have book. Lastly, our own health. At this point I ask you, @CAPS3 the computer worth everything we think it @CAPS3? No, it @CAPS3 not.",9
330,"I walked into my living room. I saw my brother on the computer talking to his friends on facebook. I thought to my self he's always on the computer never for any school reason. People always says we don't need computers I personaly agree with the statement. In the town @ORGANIZATION1 everybody mostly has computers. Without a computer to look up for content things, you have to go to the library and check out a bank. Just the other @DATE1 my friend @PERSON1 went to the library and checked out a book about the @CAPS1 culter. He loved that book he read it @DATE1 in and @DATE1 out, he read it for a book report on different culters. When he handed it into the teacher the @DATE1, when he reached the classroom the teacher looked @CAPS2 happy when she gave him back his test he had an @NUM1. He didn't use the internet your computers not mobile like a book if you wanted to learn about something while your traveling in you car you can't plug your computer in and use it unlike a book. Also books are usually funnier to read. Not haveing a computer can conclude to a lot more things like exercising. While my brother is inside all @DATE1 me and my friends are outside playing football, basketball, baseball, soccer, kirkball, and dogeball. We are very thin because @CAPS3 what we do almost every @DATE1. Unlike my brother were he is obeast because @CAPS3 all he done were before he had the computer he was as thin as us. It is also unhealth to be on the computer all @DATE1 because that can lead to staying update at night, don lead to missing the bus, and also lead to bad grades. Where when we are done with are gaine we whatch a little t.v.. then go to sleep to regain our energy we usually have atleast @NUM2 hrs. of sleep ever @DATE1 which lets us make it through school. We also make the right choses in food to eat to have more energy such as fruit and vegitibales. Were my brother eats all the junk food which helped lead to obesity. Not having a computer can help you spend more time with your family. When we go out to eat my brother is always in a push to get back on to the computer dosen't let us enjoy our food. He usually is @CAPS2 much in a rush he picks off of other people's @CAPS2 they would be finished faster, when every one wants to enjoy then food. When we want to go out to the movies my brother stays home on the computer. Even if we buy a movie and whatch it at home he won't whatch it with us he's on the computer. It really makes my mom, dad, brothers, and sisters mad that he won't do any thing but play on the computer. Even when are whole family gose out side to play a sport he won't come out and play. It's like he's not part of the familiy anymore. Its like he forgot we were even @CAPS3 the reason why I think computes should be in the state of @LOCATION1. If can lead to and relly bad grades. @CAPS2 if you want your kids healthier, better grades, and spend more time with your family then ethier sell your computer or This is happening all over the world.",10
331,"I believe that computers have a great effect effect on people. People all around the world use computers to talk online with other people, give people ability to learn about faraway people and places, and also let you explore the internet computers are a great influence on our lifestyle. Computers allow people from around the world to interact with friends and family. Some websites that allow you to do so are myspace, facebook, and @ORGANIZATION1. With facebook you can take a picture of yourself and place it on your web page. It is relly quite easy. Also, with @ORGANIZATION1 you can chat with your best friends and can actually see what they are doing. But if you want to do this you are going to need a webcam. I have @ORGANIZATION1 and I think that it is a wonderful resource. I have relatives in @LOCATION1 that I only get to see once a year. But with the help of my computer I can interact with them all year round. Computers can make people from faraway places learn about the culture and ways of another person's lifestyle. Have you ever seen the commercial where a little boy is talking to his father on the computer. Well, in this commercial is laying down on and is eating an @CAPS1 cookie. While he is doing this he is talking on the computer with his dad who is doing the same. At the same time both father and son dip their cokie into a glass of milk, eat it and laugh. I felt at that time that it was a wonderful moment because even though they are both in opposite directions the two are still having a great time. Just to think that it was all because of one computer. Exploring the internet is what a computer can do. When doing this you can play some really fun games on a rainy day when you are bored. You can look up what happened during one of your favorite basketball games. Such as how many points @PERSON1 got for your fantasy team. Also, at my school you can check your grades to see what you got on your last math test or quiz. For example if I had all A's but one @CAPS2 in math, then I would know that I would need to really study for my next test to get on A on it. With the help of the internet, I can do. So, now you know wh computers are a very important part of our society. Computers allow us to talk online with other people, give people the opportunity to learn about faraway people and places, and computers also allow everyone to explore the internet. As you can see now, computers are great influence to our lifestyle. ",9
332,"Suppose you have a family member that you have not seen in a long time and you dont have enough money to visit them because they live to far? Or you are injured or sick and you have nothing to do, so you decide to just browse the internet and you actually learn some interesting things like what new organism has scientist found out or something in history you've never known before? Amazingly, the computer is filled with knowledge like this. You could talk to family members you haven't seen before or just havent got the chance to see them in a long time. You could even know a lot of new interesting stuff about nature and history you would have never known about by just stepping outside. And just so you know more, I'll even tell you about these things. I have a half sister who I only get see like once a year or once two years. But the only way I get to interact with her is on facebook. There is also websites people use to talk to loved ones like twitter, myspace, yearbook, aim, skype ect. Not only do you just talk to them you could do a webcam chat, so you could also see them. Alot of people use webchat to talk with old friends. While on the computer you could also learn new things. Yesterday, when I was on the computer I got bored and did some random searching, and in that @NUM1 min. I learned things I never heard about, like the ""@CAPS1 massacre"" and that time when a teacher went into a spaceship for the first time and it blew up with the teacher in it. Man was that a tragedy! If you were interested in nature you could learn about all kinds of nature around the world. Also, if you are interested in ancient time with a few typing you got all kinds of fascinating things of ancient time like @PERSON1, the city that was forgetten, then found. I'm pretty sure you couldn't learn that kind of stuff stepping outside. The amazing things a computer could do! Talking with family and friends you haven't seen in which to be decades and learning fascinating things. Usually it's cool because you could learn things your teacher never new. Would you want the teacher teaching you or you teaching the teacher!",8
333,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you love computers but fear that you or loved ones spend way to much time on them? If so, then maybe we should @CAPS1 something. Toomany people have issues with their vision due to starring at computers to long. Also, people miss out on other outdoor activities as well. Finally, if people are working off of computers for their job then there missing out on same of the other important things in life such as, interacting with family and friends, enjoying the outdoors, or just simply spending time with their close ones. Now, are you for or against this descison of people getting ""hooked"" on computers? In my opinion people should be enjoying things and not spend most of their time on computers. Since people are so dependent on computers, sometimes working form one can hurt your vision. The bright white computer screen filled with all those e-mails can really affect your vision. I know my dad always gets headaches and his vision isn't the best thing when it comes to him working on a computer all day. Being indoors and on a computer all day long makes you really miss the outdoor activites that their are. Things such as sports, nature, riding a bike and many other activities are missed out because of being on a computer all day. Only fun and energized people get out and get active. Last but not least, @CAPS1 you enjoy spending time with the ones you love but seem to busy because your on the computer all day? If so then get up and go have fun! Take the wife and kids on a hike or go and ride a bike, its awesome excersise for you, family and friends and its actually fun! So, its now or never. @CAPS1 you want to be at home on a computer all day or @CAPS1 you want to be high energized and spending quality time with family and friends? Most impotantly @CAPS1 you want to be energized and healthy with no vision problems and stop those awful headaches? Well, without a if you get up and get active it will be the best decision you will make! So, get up, grab the kids and get going on your new and energized, pain free life.",8
334,"Dear newspaper editor, @CAPS1 you have a computer? @CAPS1 your kids spend all of their time on it talking in people or going on facebook or myspace? Well that’s fun and all for a few hours but some people spend a lot of time on there. They don't go out and get exercise or interact with their family and friends. Also they @MONTH1 end up getting in trouble in school or at home. If you spend all of your time on the computer doing whatever your doing you won't have time to go out and exercise. Not only will it be in appeling but it could be dangerous for your health after a while. All your time gets sucked into the computer and when your on it you feel like your not on for a long time and it ends up being like a few hours. It even happens to adults, my mom was on the computer for about an hour and she felt like it was only a few mins. When your on your computer for several hours you tend to got sucked in and not interact with anyone. I know this from experience. A few months ago I spent about a whole month just coming home from school and being on the computer for several hours. This effected my life a lot, I stopped going out on weekends with my friends, I always wanted to stay home when my family wont out. Then my mom confronted me about it and I realized all of my time on the computer wasn't good. I was missing out on a lot of things. Kids @MONTH1 also get at home or at school if they are on the computer for a long time they @MONTH1 not @CAPS1 their homework and end up failing a class and then stay back. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of the kids that stay on the computer for a long time end up either failing a class or staying rack. They @MONTH1 also get in trouble at home because they dont @CAPS1 their chores because their busy on the computer and neither the child or the children like getting in fights with one another. Now I know in a way it's good to have computers and be able to use them so we can look up information and its nice to sometimes talk to people on the computer for a little while but being on the computer for a little while but being on the computer for to long of an amount ran really mess you and your social life up. So all im trying to prove is that computers are an amazing invention but we should just use them a little less and get out and excersise, and have fun with our family and friend and @CAPS1 good in school and at home so we @CAPS1 get to spend some time on the computer. I hope you see it my way now.",8
335,"Dear @CAPS1, In many ways computers are helpful but, I don't support the use of them. The advance in technology has really taken away from peoples lives all over the world, some examples of this are lack of exercise, too much time inside, and not enough time spent with family and friends. Continue reading for more on as towny computers do'nt benefit society. As you know, when you use a computer you usually sit in a chair to do so, correct? Well, this activity is doing only one thing, not keeping you healthy or inshape. I'm sure that you want to be healthy, and to be healthy you must get some sort of exercise through out your day, and sitting on thje computer is not helping you one bit. So as you can clearly see, so far using computers is not beneficial to our society, continue for more cons of using computers as much as they are used. Believe it or not, using a computers is unhealthy, and not beneficial, in more than one way. The reason for this is because, not only oo you not get enough exercise, you won't go outside as much. you @MONTH1 be wondering as to why not outside is unhealthy, but it is because you dont recieve the needed amount of fresh air that you need to not be sick. Could you imagine the amount of people that would be sick if everyone used the computer for the majority at their day? Well, lets just it wouldn't be fun to count them all. Now that you know two ways that computers are not beneficial to society.Keep reading for one rest way. As you probably knows, it is a hard task to keep a big family close to each other, and using computers is'nt going to anything to help you. So, why use them? Trust me, spending quality time with your family and friends can be just as much, or even more fun than playing your favorite computer games, and in my opinion your family should be the most valuable thing in your life, so don't lose them for a computer. Now that you have finished reading. i would like to thank you for your time reading this letter concerning, lack of exercise, too much time inside, and not enough time with family, is not beneficial to society.",9
336,"Computers are used world wide everyday, and most of the time @CAPS2 is used for a good reason. Computers help out by making @CAPS2 possible to get all the info you want, like for a trip. @CAPS1 you wanted to go to a close but fancy restaurant you @MONTH1 use a computer so you know how far. Computers also help out, making @CAPS2 possible to talk to friends that you haven't seen for years. @CAPS2 is also great way to meet new people. Let's say you are really stressed at work or school and you forget your book, you can usually bring @CAPS2 up on the computer and do @CAPS2 there. First, computers help out with traveling, sight seeing and lots more. When you travel, dont you want to know everything? And the biggest detail you want to know is the cost and the computer can usually give you a close to exact price for everything. Now that help's out a bunch when your traveling the world. And also when your site seeing you usually want to find either the most amazing or romantic spot were you are. And @CAPS1 you type in ""the most romantic spot in somers"" @CAPS2 should come up with a bunch of spots. So dont drive to miles just to get a map or brochure, use your computer and print one off. Second, @CAPS1 there was a friend you haven't seen in years and you want to talk, you can go on the computer. The computer helps in so many ways @CAPS2 could even tell you were this person lives and you could surprise visit him/her. When your on the computer, you can even meet new friends and have conversations with them. and even meet them someday. And @CAPS1 you and that new friend get along then mabey you and that person could be best friends. So @CAPS1 you haven't seen or talked to someone in a while that you knew use the computer to have a chat. Third, say your teacher or boss yelled at you today and no one has been nice to you all day and you forget your homework book or paperwork. Were do you go? the computer, @CAPS2 can bring most any paper work or work book you need to get the job done. @CAPS1 you forgot your homework book, you dont want to get a falling grade. on this homework. So you go to your computer from there. And @CAPS1 you forgot your paper work, and @CAPS1 you didn't finish this project for work tonight you would be fired, you could just go on the computer, find the work and finish @CAPS2. Also save your job. So that why computers help out so much in this lifetime. Last, that is why in this lifetime you need computers. They help us with our vacation trips. They help with conversation with old friends we haven't seen forever. Also they help with your school and job work. At least @PERCENT1 of our population use computers every day and with out them our society would colaps/ @DATE1. So think about the decision you are making and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 will benefit our society or make our society @DATE1 to its knees.",9
337,"Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people that are addicted to computers are not fit and don't play sports. I have a computer at home and I know how much fun it is talking to your friends on @CAPS1 or whatever you talk to your friends are. If you're not fit and don't enjoy the beauty of nature you will not know how to live a good life. I'm not saying that you won't get anywhere in life, but it won't be much interesting. I play lots of sports and I love them all. I am fit and yes I do like going on @CAPS1 and chatting with my friends, but thats not as important as is breathing fresh air and playing sports with your friends. Yes, the computer has all different kinds of bad stuff and good stuff. I mean you could learn about faraway places with out going there, but then what would be the fun of that. For an example, if you go to @LOCATION1 for snowboarding, dont you feel great when your going down that @CAPS3? I know I do instead of being home on the computer. Nature is beautiful I am thankful to god of giving us that beauty and all animals. It makes life better, georgus. I love taking hikes with my family up a @CAPS3. That fresh air you can't get anywhere else or even riding your @CAPS5 up a trail, the beauty of that is unbelievable, you can't find it any other place. Doctors show that @PERCENT2 of people that spend time more than @NUM1 hours a day on a computer have glasses or have a very poor vision. All those people didn't want poor vision but beacuse of the computer they got that wich really stinks. Now as you can you see computers really can change your life. So that's your discision. Pick wrong from right, all up to YOU. Now make it.",8
338,"Dear Newspaper editor I would like to make @CAPS3 about the benifits of owning a computer. For example you can learn many thing you would of never of been able too, you can also go in chat rooms and talk with friends or other people and it can even make teaching esyer too. Computers in many countres are standard and we use then to learn many things but if you bring one to the tribes in @LOCATION1 it will look like a alein object but once they know how to use it it can open there eyes for ever many people in remote ribes and areas dont even know theres been a man on the meon. Another great thing about the computer is you can pay bills such as taxes, insurance, credit cards and othe payments which is good so if you cant get of your house or the place is closed you wont get late fees and it can even help you save large amounts of money too. Many people use the computer to socialize by joining online website such as @CAPS1, twitter and myspace were you can talk veiw pictures and see what friends are up to. Also on @CAPS2 you can message friends too. Further more many people play games on the computer some are single player and some are online and have millions of players on at a time. you can also hook other gaming system up to your computer to play with other people and even yet hints and cheats too. The biggest reasons that computers are benifit though is that they revolutionized school now for homework instead of doing a work sheet you go on the computer and do it and print it out or email it to your teacher. Another reason the computer is amazing is that it makes research for projects and home work much more easyer, redrable and it ean give you a much more broader view of the topic. By far the best thing ahead the computer is the fact that many teachers use them to teach with and show videos. Therefore it is much easier to learn and under stand thing wich will help us in the future be successful. Also many kids pay less attention when a teaches is giving a lecture but when there is a computer playing a video it will grasp the students attention much better. These are all the reasons why I think the computer is a excellant invention and every family and school should own one I hope you will find my @CAPS3 very persuading and puplish it.",8
339,"To whom it @MONTH1 @CAPS1, I have recently heard about your argument on the effects that modern day computers have on society. Some people feel they have a positive effect, such as learning new information, and interacting or chatting with other people. Others feel that society is devoting to much time to computers, they feel that these people are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and with their family. I feel that people are devoting themselves to the computer. People think that all things on the internet are true, they're not, @PERCENT1 of all teens across the country are addicted to the computer. First, things posted on the internet are not always true. They can be posted by anyone, whether it's true or not. My friend found a website with very detailed information for an essay. She turned it in, and the teacher gave it back the following day. In big red letters it said ""false information"" @CAPS2 she had gotten the information from a book. she pobably would've gotten an ""A+"". Second, @PERCENT1 of teens living in the @LOCATION1 have become addicted to using the computer. My friend was obsessed with facebook from @NUM1 until @NUM2 she was on, daily. She began failing classes. She didn't do homework, didn't study for tests! She failed the @NUM3 grade. This all happened because she was addicted to a website. This is why I agree with the statement that experts are concerned with people spending to much time on the computer @CAPS2 you want to continue a healthy lifestyle, and avoid becoming to addicted to the computer, limit yourself. Make the smart choice.",8
340,"I think that computers do benefit us. They allow us to interact with people, talk to family far away, help us with school, gives us easy access to information, and much more people usually have family and friends who live away from each other and the computer allows us to interact with them. The computer lets us email and instant message them, play games against them, be their friend on websites like facebook so you can see recent pictures of them. It's not easy to interact with family and friends who live so far away and the internet allows us to do that. The computer doesn't just let you talk to family and friends but it lets you meet new people and interact with new people from all over the world. It let's you make new friends and play games with them or chat. The computer really helps you to just stay in touch with other people and it's a very easy and convinent way to do so. The next thing the computer helps us with is it entertains us. Children are very hiper and after homework is done, we don't have anything to do so the computer let's us play games on it, chat with friends, watch movies and videos, up load picture, etc. It does alot for us. Kids could hang out after school but if they can go on the computer it allows them want to go home where their parents know that their safe and away from drugs, alcohol, and other bad things they can get into. Just because kids like the computer, that doesn't mean that that's the only thing they do. Kids are very athletic, always playing sports and always hiper but the computer helps that go away. They go to school for hours, then go to basketball or football practice, sometimes we just need a break. The computer isn't always fun but it's very useful. The computer helps us with school. It allows us to type essays and projects. It also allows us easy information to help write the essays. Websites like google and bing are easy websites to help us get good and accurate information about whatever the topic is that we are doing. The computer is very useful when it comes to school. As you can see, the computer is very important in our lives and makes life alot easy and it's your choice how much you want to spend on it. But no matter what, the computer definatly benefits us.",10
341,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1. I am @NUM1 years old and I go to a @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 called @ORGANIZATION1. I am a really smart kid. In @CAPS1 opinion I benefit people using computers. You should keep reading @CAPS1 essay because I am going to tell you @NUM2 good reasons why I benefit people using computers. @CAPS1 first reason is they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. For example, when I am always using the computer and when I'm doing research it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people. Another example is when ever I watch @CAPS2.V on @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says that people learn about learn about faraway places and people on the internet @PERCENT1 of the time. @CAPS1 second reason is it allows people to talk online with other people for example when I am on the computer everyday I visit @CAPS1 facebook it always gives me a chance to talk to @CAPS1 friends and other people online. Another example is when I go on a computer and I search computers.org it says that it lets people @PERCENT2 of the time talk to others online. @CAPS1 @NUM4 reason is it allows students to get information when they're doing a project. For example when I always use the @ORGANIZATION1 computers it allows me to get information for example, about @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 govina that is why I benefit people using computers. Another example is when ever I check out a magazine on computers it tells me that kids get alot of information when they're doing projects @PERCENT2 of the time. In conclusion, I benefit people using computers because they teach hand eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, it allows people to talk online with other people and it allows students to get information when they're doing projects. Those are the @NUM2 reasons why I benefit people using computers. So please the local newspaper please try to make this believable.",8
342,"Do computers really benifit society? This has been a tricky question for years. Some people say computers are a huge help and it allows us to see the world through a different perspective; we learn more from computers and this vast increase in tecknology. Though others say computers are addicting, it is the @CAPS2 unsafe and unsecure machine to be using especially when it is left a lot of personal files on it while hooked up to the internet. Plus people spend more time on a computer than ever, missing out on thier families and friends, not being able to enjoy nature and the other simple things in life. Besides, if you want my honest opinion, computers should only be used as tools. ""The fact is many people look to computers as personal diaries or something to save files on or even something to play games on,"" says @PERSON2. ""They ignore the biggest fact that computers are only used to make life easier."" This is really what computers are made to do, help us. It could be as simple as a @CAPS1 (@ORGANIZATION1) or as complexed as a super computer but it still only serves the main purpose of making life easier. Even if you tried to upgrade a computer it would still serve the same purpose, yet people still look on it as if it were still the next big thing in entertainment. Many people might not even know it yet but computer can turn on you and really ruin your life. Ever since @PERSON1 made @ORGANIZATION2 the @CAPS2 popular disk @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 around, people have been using computers alot. Its not because he created the fastest computer ever. It is because @ORGANIZATION2 is selling world wide; for buisnesses, small companies, schools, even in entertainment. A few years ago they made something called the xbox @NUM1. It revolutionized both gaming and the way people look at gaming. But whats the problem here? The problem is that because of @ORGANIZATION2 people are now more addicted to entertainment. When this happens people will start becoming dependent on a computer. Its not that @ORGANIZATION2 did anything bad but the fact that since @CAPS2 computers have internet, those people who depend on computers are going to find it hard to avoid being hacked or worse getting all their information stolen. There is this one thing about computers that remains constant. Family and friends will find it hard to talk to there loved one when they spend all there time on computers. This makes comunication hard, and like I said before its very addicting. ""@CAPS2 of the people who don't have real friends will chat with people online not knowing who they really are."" says @CAPS3 @PERSON3. Making friends online is the @CAPS2 unsafe thing to do on a computer. Over @PERCENT1 of the people online are not who they say they are and people will often break away from thier real friends just to find this new ""friend"" they've made. So remember, even though computers are",10
343,"Dear @CAPS1 I think that computers are beneficial to our society for example, computers are very helpful to everybody. Computers alsi travel nows faster. And they can teach us new things. I am not saying computers don’t have their downs, but, computers also have their ups. Computers are very helpful in many ways. They help people find lost fmaily members, and they help police officers find many criminals. Haven't you lost soemone in your family, or haven't spoken to them in years and always wanted to find them and get back in with them? Well that's what computer are for. Aslo haven't you been concern about the many criminals on the street, and wanted to get them of the streets and in jail where they belong but didnt have a way to do that? Computers  help. Haven't you notice that computers are  help police many women in the present time? Computers  people in the , but they help travel fastre for example say you heard there was hurricane or tornado and you needed to find out how . All you have to do is on the computer and look it up. Also, there an earthquake in @LOCATION1 and the didn't information to help you. You would just go on the computer and find all the information you need. COmputers are of many things for they you. Computers teach you alot, like hand-eye cordiantion. Think about it, you might on hte computer that, but it helps. If you yourself while you are on the comp[puter you would start to see that you are typing fastre and learning where all the letters are on the keyboard now, then when you saw your first computer. Computers though, not only teaches you hand-eye cordination but it also teaches you of many wonder places. Such as @CAPS2 falls, rain forests etc. Now, dont get me wrong, @CAPS3 not saying that computer dont their downs and that people dont take advantage of computers. but, I am saying that they help society alot. They travel news fatser. Also they taught alot to people. So take my opinion into consideration. And think about how much computers have done for you.",9
344,"Dear local newspaper, More and more people are using computers there days. Some people think computers are an improvements to society. Others are concerned that people spent too much time on computers and not enough time exercising and spending time with friends and family. I believe that computers can be a bad thing. I think this because some people spend to much time on them,, it's one of the leading causes of obesity, and it interfers with people social lifes. According to recent studys, about @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people spend most of their time on their computers. Many ot these people spend their time on online games and socializing websites such as facebook and myspace. Others spend it shopping or learning. Some of the online games include world of warcraft, rune scope, and many @CAPS1's @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 games. Many people who spend most of their time on the computer are or @MONTH1 became obese. According to @PERSON1, spending alot of time on computer is one of the main reasons for obesity. Many experts agree that computers are the learning cause of obesity. between @DATE1 and @DATE2 more people have been using their computers more often. The obesity rate has increased between then too. Most of the people who spend alot of time on the computer don't interact with their friend and family much. This can lead to ruined relationships, loss of friends and the chance of losing your love with family. Many experts, such as @PERSON2, say that a person can become depressed from not interacting with friends and family. He also says some of the people who became depressed start thinking of suicide. Spending too much time on the computer is a bad thing would you want to spend too much time on the computer even ater hearing the cons of it? I believe spending too much time on the computer is bad for everyone.",8
345,"Dear @STATE1's newspaper editors I have recently read an atical that was talking about how experts are concerned that people are spending way too much time on their computers. Well I agree with them. I strongly belive that computers are tacking time away from you exercising enjoying nature and even interacting with family and friends. Well if you look at teen's this day and how more and more are becauming over weight like back in the days when their wasn't computer or internet not as much people were over weight or even obiste because they had time to go out and exercis or play sports with othes. Exercising is importent because espeshaly when as a teen you are over weight or even obiste well theis problems just don't go away this will cost you in the futer because not only do you have to chance of getting deobetice but you also have to pay for all the medications and treatments that comes with it. Experts also belives that by spending time on the computer will tack time away from enjoing the things that nature has to offer. When other might argue to it is a good thing for people to learn about the different types of place's in the world. Well I delive why do you have to just read about the places online and look of the picture why can't you be the one tacking the pictures for other to see. And why can't you be the one experincing it insted of just reading about it. Experts also believe that by spending time on the computer it is tacking away time from you being able to interacting with family members and friends. Well as a teen myself I have learned that by intercating with family and friends are vary important to our health. I am not the only person that agrees with that because study shows that kid that can talk to their perents and have good convercations with their parent have the ability to do well in school and have more respect towed others verces the the kid or teen that can't really have conversation or talk to their parents. For example if you are the type of person that talk to your family You will have good grades such as A's and @CAPS1's and will learn to have respect for other and the person that can't talk to their parents have troble concentrating or even macking troble fro themselfs and getting @CAPS2's and @CAPS3's. Well I know that as a @STATE1 newpapper editer you are a vary busy person and have lot of diffent things to do but I hope you take this in to concideration and remmember the importants of exercisin, enjoying rotune and interacting with familys and friends.",9
346,"Dear local newspaper committee...., I am writing to you, about how there is a substancial dilemma within the concern of computer use. From my data that I have collected, computers are both somewhat good, and bad. But I believe that there are more reasonable ""@CAPS1,"" toward computer use. In my opinion, I state that computers are quite addicting due to, addiction of computer, loss time of exercise, and how computers @MONTH1 ""help,"" one in obtaining the loss of their social enviorment. Computer @MONTH1 seem helpful but of @ORGANIZATION1 they are a great way to research for @ORGANIZATION1 reasons. But there is also the choice of books for research. Computer use has risen to a substancial crisis line, because they are addicting. An example is the well-known link called, ""@CAPS2,"" @CAPS2 is a place where you can socialize. But when your child has a @CAPS2, and they are on the computer doing ""homework,"" there is a @PERCENT1 that they will end upon @CAPS2, than rather doing their homework that important information was found at an @ORGANIZATION1 @DATE1. Computers are addicting also because of online computer games. Computer games online can be fun, but are a complete waste of time for you electrical bill, and @ORGANIZATION1 purposed of you child. Computers are very addicting in terms of @CAPS2, and online games. Computers are somewhat good, but are very to you health. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 has increased their weight, due to videogames and computer? Computers are horrible when it comes to this topic. Overtime, you begin to gain weight by spending more time using the computer and less time working out and staying fit. This also revolves around addiction, by using the computer over a large period of time. In the end, computers are a harzardous topic, when it comes to working out, and staying in shape. Computers are terrible and horrified when it comes to friends. Friends are people who spend time with you and interact with you. But computers see it a different way. by using computer for a long period of time, you begin to think how computers are all you need. Soon enough, your friends will leave you because you don't care about them, and forget them. This also revolves around addiction. By addiction, you lose your friends and you damage your social enviornment. Computer @MONTH1 seem ""fun,"" but are defuliated when it comes to friends. In the end, I beleive that computers are a waste, because they are addicting you become very unhealthy and they strive to damage your social enviornment. With the facts I have stated, they have supported my reasons. Computers are not the way to go. So, try books.",9
347,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think computers are bad for society. It came to my attention that many people are concerned that computers are not very good in my opinion I think computers are They help typeing skills. Computers are also very helpful with and crofing pictures, and they make it to find information. First of all, computer are very helpful with typing skills. Other people doesn't use computers takes six years to @CAPS3 younger people like young skills use very quickly. Actuly @PERCENT1 of teens can type in a minutes Who takes @NUM1 minutes. Computers have a great effect on many people with their typeing skills. Computers makes it so copier with so many pictures editing and many more, editing pictures from a expensive digital @CAPS2 it for free on your computer? A computers makes it and it through a lack of information to just computer and find it faster. The computer you can look for information make faster. For example you have to @CAPS2 a project on @CAPS4. Instead of going to the library and spending more on a book about @CAPS4 you can go on google.com and type in @CAPS4. So much information and so much faster. Get with the program computers are in. In conclusion, I think computers is a great invention. They make it easier to find information and typing skills. Also they make it so much easier to crop and edit photos, please take my suggestions sereusly.",8
348,"Dear local newspaper, I am writing to you because computers are affecting humans in many ways. Some can be terrible, and others not so bad. Many average people are now staying inside all day on the computer playing games, or on facebook and other interactive websites such as twitter and @CAPS1. This crisis is interfering with school, work, or excersize. More and more people each day are not getting enough exercize or work done. We have to stop this devastating pandemic! People who are staying inside all day arn't as healthy as they were before. There immune system making the risk of getting sick greater. This can cause people in severe positions or even death. @CAPS4 you stay inside all day every day, the computer will be so addicting it will take over you and make it more important. In order to maintain healthy you have to eat right and good in riding a bike. @CAPS2 someone is inside on the computer frequently, they arn't @CAPS2 you're addicted to something like watching t.v. or playing @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you are addicted to the it can also interfere with family events, sports. @CAPS2 youre on the computer you forget about homework, grades drastically making you go to summer school, or even repeating a grade. Also @CAPS2 you don't prepare for sports it can make you not play up to your potential. This is why computers are affecting every day people. There are more reasons how people are being affected by computers, but these are the most common.",8
349,"@CAPS1 you want people to be over weight? @CAPS1 you wat our beautifal out doors to be ruined? And @CAPS1 you want familys to be distant because they are to pre @CAPS2? Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of familys dont talk because they are to preocupied with computar games. The issue to grapple with is @CAPS1 computars have an affect on people. Yes, I think that computars have a negitive affect on people based on the following reasons. People spent to much time on the computar and dont get enought exersize, they dont enjoy the nature that we have, and they dont inter act with there family and friends. People spent to much time on the computar and dont get enough exersize. Statistics show that @PERCENT3 of people that are over weight spend more time on the computar than on the track. I remember a time when I was over weight be cause I spent to much time on the computar. One day my mom took the computar ant threw it out the window and I had no chioce but to go outside and get some exersize. @CAPS1 you want kids to be over weight like I was? Many people dont get to enjoy the great out doors because they are to preocupied with the computar. Lisa, a volentere worker in @LOCATION1, says This feild used to be a vast array of plants and animal life, but now it is a waste land because of computars. No one had the time to worry of the natural wonder because they were to @CAPS2 with there computar animated jobs and didnt care what came of it. @CAPS1 you want this to happen to our country? @PERCENT4 of high technological places are dirty with very little plant life because the workers need to tend to the computars rather than the bushes. Some familys have a hard time talking about their dayly lifes becuse they spendin to much time on the computar and dont spend the time to talk and get to know each other. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 ofdevorces are related to not being able to have aconversation and with more technoligy on the way that number will grow. I remember that my parents got devorced because my dad spent more time on the computar than talking to me or my mom. Most people think that computars are good for research. Yes, but you are still cooped up in the house insted of in a big library with all the information you need. I think that computars have a negitive impact on people.""",10
350,"When you use or computer, you have the ability to do virtualy anything. The internet has millions of users and makes life a lot easier. You have acess to talk with people who are all the way across the world! You can search any topic and learn more about it. The internet even encourages you to get outside and see things for yourself. In the @DATE1 it just a seasy to contact someone in @LOCATION1 as it is to contact someone at the other side of town. As long as oyu have a internet connection you can stay in touch with a friend thats moved aparent on a buisness trip, anyone! Some @MONTH1 say that you should just use a phone but you could use video chat on the internet. You can see someone who's thousands of miles away, as if they were right infront of you. These days its harder to not stay in touch than it to stay in touch. @NUM1 or @NUM2 years ago any information you neede came from a book. You would have to go all the way to the library, find the right book, and read it. If you were lucky you could find a bit of what you were looking for. These days you simply type it in to a search browser and you instantly get thousands of webistes on that topic. The internet allows you to learn about any subject you'd like. You can spend @CAPS1 experts or give that some poeple spend too much time on thier computers. Seeing all those great places and beautiful pictures encourages @CAPS1 poeple to get outside and see it for themselves. On a recent poll @PERCENT1 of peopel went on a hike after seeing a youtube video about how great it is to get outside. The internet has a massive effect on us. It can also bring families together. For example at dinner, you can get a great recipe off the internet. In fact, you can get millions of great recipes. The internet was an amazing idea. @CAPS1 would argue that it was the greatest invention ever. Yes, it can be dangerous, but with proper education on it the internet is a good source of information and an @CAPS2 pass-tie, if not abused. Being able to see and talk others so far away was seeminly impossible a few decades ago. Getting information has never been so easy. We are lucky to live in an age where the intenet is right at our fingertips.",9

You want to learn about @LOCATION1, but there arnt any books. And you want to talk to your friends. That’s what would have happend if we dident have advances in technology. No handeye cordenation, we wouldent be able to learn about far way places and we coudent online. Ccomputers benifit our lives in so many ways. To begin with, hand eye cordenation is very important. Without @CAPS5 we woudent be able to ware or even hold a pensil. @PERCENT1 of peoples hand eye cordenation has emproved when using a computer. That was proven in a @DATE1 say a @CAPS2 by @PERSON2, head of human reactions. “@CAPS3 knows that your hands are the most oversized part of you body, the computer help down the movements to hone hand eye cordenation.” – @PERSON1 said that in a @DATE2 interview with sience magaziene. When you are clumsy you break things. Importan things sumtimes, like @PERSON3 in @LOCATION2 broke her mothers glass vase. @CAPS5 could have been helped if she had used a computer. In addition, computers give us the power to learn about faraway places. No books! @PERCENT2 of people prefer looking up information on a computer than in a book. @CAPS5’s a fact. Some people wouldent have heard about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 if @CAPS5 wasent for the websights that brodcasted updates on @CAPS5. Campers weudent have heard. In @ORGANIZATION2 had a front page spread to promote the use of computers instead of books. Books could be outdated but the computer will always have uptodate answers. Also, people need to be able to talk online. Bisness meetings, governments plans, to just chatting with a friend. People need to be able to stay in tuch. If the presedent couldent vidio conference he would be flying everyware. Emale is the only way @PERSON5 from @CAPS4 talks to her coworkers. “ I just am located so far away, its so much easier.” @CAPS5 makes bissnesses and major incoperations flow.”@CAPS6 is now the only way kids talk @CAPS5 seems.” @PERSON4 says. @CAPS5 lets them feel like there a part of somthing biger then they are. Now, @CAPS1 happy, healthy, and educated young and old amaricans. They can do and research whatever they want. Its amazing what technology does. @CAPS5 alows you to talk online research faraway places, and practice your handeye cordenation. That sounds like a good thing to me!

352,"Computers have helped people tramendisly over the past years. Thanks to computer scientest have found cours for deseses, jobs have become easier and communication with friends or family have become afordable. I believe that computers have a positive effect on people because they educate people on places in the world, help people with their jobs, and give people a chance to talk to phone without having to pay for anything. Is someone a trip to a country that they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and their culture. Another thing they might do is go to a website that could have them find afordable flights or a hotel to stay at. If a child is doing a report about a country in @LOCATION1 they can go on the computer to find out facts on that country. Computers educate people about places all over the world. You can go on a website that has videos and short clips about what has been going on and learn about current events. any costs. If you want to see a friend for her birthday but don't have the money to fly halfway around the world to see her you can vidieo chat with her. Computers help people save money by talking on the computers with friends, family and even co-workers. Computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented. They help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about. They also make jobs and work easier, and also help people save a lot of money by talking to people on the computers insted of on the phone. Computers have improved demastrecly over the years, the screens use to be so small and you would have to press all these buttons just to boot it up and now computers can be as big as a flat screen @CAPS1 and you can turn them on with just a push of a button. Who knows what computers will be like @NUM1 years from now?",10
353,"Dear @CAPS1, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I support advantages in technology and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, they allow you to talk to people online, and you can play games games that can help you with your school-work. Do you believe that computers give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places? You can use google.com and look up different cultures and find out how the stuff they do is different from us and what kind of food they eat. For example, in @LOCATION1, they sit on the floor @CAPS2 they eat. We get to sit at a table on our dining rooms or kitchens. @PERCENT1 of people in would floor. Surely, computers allow you @CAPS2 my cousin on the computer and @CAPS3 important to note that, on computers you can play games that can help you with your school-work. You can go on sites that you on your @CAPS4. Show you how your body works for @CAPS5, and tell you about the revolutionary war for @CAPS6 @CAPS7. These sites are not boring. This a whole lot of fun! Whoever thought that learning would be fun? I sure didnt. The time is now! Just think that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends because no matter what, people will always have time for that.",8
354,"Dear local newspaper, I do agree that computers have impacted human society greatly. Therefore, my opinion is that is @MONTH1 be one of the greatest inventions. I would say this because there are different help programs or websites that @MONTH1 help people in everyday life. Especially students have the ability to study from education webpages. Also, people are able to communicate online. Lastly, you are able to type stories instead of hand-writing them. Having the advantage to study online is great. Different websites with tons of information and true facts @MONTH1 really affect grades of most students. Did you know about @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 go on educational websites for information for writing, whether it's an essay or non-fiction story? Thanks to computers, there is a great chance students @MONTH1 receive a passing grade. Communication online has made huge impact worldwide. Whether you use facebook, @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1 etc., communicating with family or friends is fantastic. For example, I use facebook and I love talking to my family down in @LOCATION2, whom I see about once every couple years. Online communication has affected people because there is an easier way to talk to other instantly. Just a push of a button, and you have immediate communication with someone. Finally, people have the ability to type on a program if they wanted to type a letter or story. For instance, if you use microsoft word, you can type up whatever you want. This has effected people because it is a faster ans easier way to write. Therefore, if you finish earlier than you would have if you typed it, you would have extra leisure time, or more time to get the rest of your work done. Also, it is easy for me because I type like the wind; after practice, of course. In conclusion, the invention of computers helped and still do help society in many ways. But, the three ways that i have chosen to tell you about in this letter, I feel, have impacted us the most. I hope this helps you with you questions about how computers effected people. Thank you for taking time to read my letter. Have a good day.",10
355,"Dear local newpaper: @CAPS1 you being the local newspaper, you have the power to say how you feel about the effects computers give to people. I believe that computers give great effects to people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it allows you to talk to people. In all, @PERCENT1 of people agree with my idea about computers. Firstly, using computers teaches people about hand-eye coordination. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. In all, computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more. Secondly, computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 quotes, ""I always use computers for my work because it helps me learn about many new things. @CAPS2, it lets my wife and I search details about a trip we want to go on."" @CAPS2, the people agree with what @PERSON1 stated. However, people @MONTH1 say that computers give the wrong information many times, but if you find a wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirly, if you use computers it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because if you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then video chat. It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way. @CAPS2, instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes, go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat. Lastly, taking to people and being active in other peoples life is important. In conclusion, you will have great eye coordination, you will be able to research faraway places, and you will always be allowed to video chat or talk to family online. @CAPS2, I want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem. Lastly, you will have the best feeling ever if you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot!",7
356,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are very important to some people. Everyone uses them or has used them before. It isn't bad to own a computer because you can still excersise and be able to do the things you do everyday. Lets say that you need to look something up, the thing you always go to for information is a computer. People in schools, industries, and in homes use it all the time. Teenagers will usually go on the computer to talk to friends or maybe play games, I know I do. It's so they don't waste their time being bored all day. Excersising and being active is indeed very good for teenagers to really look into, but even though they do that, they don't push away the computer. It will always be there when they don't have anymore homework or when they finish running around the neighborhood with their friends. I can't imagine what my life would be like coming home from soccer practice and done with my homework and the computer or @CAPS1 is one of the first places I run to so I can just sit back and relax. Computers should be known as our friends. They won't hurt us. They just give us what we need and want. Reaserch is a good example because everyone uses the computer to find whatever it is that people are looking for on it. And if they're done with reaserching they can have a little fun by games and friends. But I believe that the main purpose for computers is information. Whenever I get home from school, I finish my homework and stretch a little for cheerleading then whatch @CAPS1 or go on the computer so i'm not bored. It's not that i'm not active because I'm not working out or excersising. It's because I have nothing to do, so why not make my time occupied? Everyone does it so I'm not the only one. Yes, computers are just this square box with a keyboard, but if you don't push it away from peoples common lives than you can see that they aren't what you say they are and they won't rot peoples brain or anything. The reason they are in an office or living room or bedroom is because people like them and uses them for their needs.",8
357,"Dear Local Newspaper, ""@CAPS1 people have any viruses in there head?"" @CAPS2 they need a maricle to pop up away from the computer. Why I stated that is @CAPS2 its unhealthy for many people. Its not using time wisely. But most importantly, it can get you into trouble you don't want to be in. Stick around if you want the anecdote for the computer virus so people can be cured. OMG!!! My stepfather needs to get of the computer! It's unhealthy the amount of time he spends online. He needs to get up and move around. But instead he just sit there online everyday eating. Another reason why its unhealthy is, as you get older your bone's get weaker and when your old you can't move lik you use to and want to. Man just think, if we didn't have a computer, all the time/money people spend on computers can be spent for stuff more useful. For example @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people love computers more than life itself. @PERCENT1 of the world spend their time doing somthing active instead of being on the computer."" @CAPS3 an computer is nice but you got to know that you, can't get controlled by it. ALERT! ALERT!!! Sirence is getting closer and closer to my house. I am getting scared @CAPS2 I am online and i'm wondering if i did anything wrong. But it wasn't me who the cops was coming for, it was my next door neighbor. I guess he was doing illegal stuff online that he had no buisness doing. See computer's can get you into trouble. For example, I remember when i got into trouble with my parents and they look the computer away from me. Now, you know why computers effect people. How unhealthy it is, to many people. Why it takes up so much time from people's life. And all the trouble it puts people through.",9
358,"Dear Newspaper editor, I think that computers are @CAPS1 for everyone. First of all, you can learn about places that are around the world in a click. Also, you can communicate with friends and family. Finally, it makes your life so much easier. Here are some reasons why you should get a computer for your family. First, you can learn about things you didn't even know were real, in an instant. You can learn about ancient civilizations, different cultures, and different recipes for tonights dinner. you can get help in school work also. If you need to learn about the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @LOCATION1, all you have to do is type in it. If you need to learn your multiplication table, you type it in and it will show up in the matter of seconds. The internet is @CAPS1 for searching up all types of things. Secondly, you can talk to your family members and friends on the internet. Ive heard a lot of people saying people need to spend more time with their family. So on the computer you can talk to someone in @LOCATION2, and evrywhere else. Its like a pen pal but you don't waste money buying envelopes and stamps to send a letter. computers cost a lot of many but it is worth it. You can do almost evrything on the computer. Lastly, if you get a computer it makes your life so much easier. Instead of going to the library and getting a cook book, you can type in dinner recipies for chicken. Your computer will come up with hundreds of different ways to make a @CAPS1 chicken for dinner. You can tell a friend that you cant it to there party. Also, teaches you homework that you did. if you buy a computer your life would be more relaxing. In conclusion, you should buy a computer. If you do you will learn so many things. Its like having a book with everything you will every need or want to know. This is why computers are good to have and be on for a reasonable amount of time. ",9
359,"Dear local newspaper, I feel that computers are very useful to society. For example, millions of people and companies and small buisnesses require the use of computers in order to optimally run their buisness. Everyone who uses computers on a daily basis can confirm that they are very useful. In fact, computers are so useful, some schools are starting to notice. I hightly reccomend that you get aquanted with such a useful and very recognized plece of technology. Did you know that many billion-dollar companies and small buisnesses require the uses that a computer has to offer? For example, my mother is s former-district manager of the fast-food company, @ORGANIZATION1. When she worked at the company, they gave her a laptop that she could use only for her work. This proves my point that companies and small buisnesses require the features of a computer to smoothly run the buisness of which they run or one employed at. The technology of computers has brought education to new. Some teachers (including my own, @PERSON1) have taken the initiative to incorporate the modern technology of computers into their teachings. Classes have even been created in schools because of the popularity of computers. For example, at my school, a computer education (or, comp, for short) class has been created for kids to understand the knowledge and skills using a computer can give to them in the real-world. In my opinion, I it is great that computers are incorporated in so many places. Computers are used by millions of people every day. Such buisnesses are corporate like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 are starting to see the brilliance in using computers in their company. In fact, computers are so useful and helpful, teachers have taken up using computers in their classrooms. I hope it is not just me that sees the good that a computers brings, but anyone else that @MONTH1 have taken a glare at this letter.",9
360,"In modern society, @CAPS3 is rare that you come across someone who doesn't know how to basicly operate a computer. According to the statistics project known on youtube as ""shift happens"", most children in the @LOCATION1, @PERCENT1 in facts, have used a computer by age four. While @CAPS3 can be debated that computers are bad, i firmly disagree. Computers are one of the best technological advances the human race has made. they have helped education, reconnecting, and are even at times good for the environment. I wonder why people disagree, and i hope that after reading this, you will too. At my schoo, there are three computer labs, each with about twenty five computers, a library with twenty computers, and each teacher has two computers in their classroom. Wheni look at these amounts and addit to what i know about computers in other @CAPS1 schools, @CAPS3 is clear to me that computers have helped the education system. Many teachers can have students research projects with the click of a button. There are websites where students who were out from school can get their assignments for the next day. Also, teachers can put their grade books in their had drive. This saves paper and ensures accuracy in the final grade. As a student, i think that computers have greatly improved schools in many ways, but mostly in those above. At one point or another in life, we are all older and want to reconnect with our old friends. Thanks to computers, the process of reconnecting is much easier. There are social networks such as facebook, twitter, and @CAPS2, that are valuable for finding your friend from @DATE1 camp. Let's say you have been connected with someone, and you've just found out that you got a promotion. You want to call, but you don't know the hone number, but you know the email address. Email messages send instantly to anywhere. (And while you're at @CAPS3, ask for a phone number!) @CAPS3's always great to talk with old friends. Computers have helped @LOCATION1 make that easier. My friend recently purchased a sony laptop. She liked not only the features, but that @CAPS3 was an energystar, or eco-friendly. Now a days, computers have been made green in the battle for the environment. Paper is saved with online encylopedias, newspapers, journals, etc. Not only that but computers are needing less and less electricity. You save green and are green! Today's society is helping mother nature not only in our actions, but in computers too. In my opinion, computers are helping @LOCATION1, not hurting @LOCATION1. They have assisted education, social reconnecting and the environment. We must look kindly upon the advancement and miracle invention known as the computer.",10
361,"Dear editor, Computers are one of the best things that have ever happened to the human race. They benefit society in every way imaginable, and have numerous positive affects on people. Computers improve hand eye coordination, allow people to learn about many subjects that books do not give them acess to, and allow millions of people every day to talk and communicate with friends and family. The most important use for computers is learning. Using computers, billions of people gain knowledge that they never would have been able to learn before. Many people like myself check the weather on the computer daily, making sure we are prepared or dressed appropriatly for the weather. Without computers, I would not be able to do this. Also, on days when it snows during the night, I always check the school's website when I wake up in order to ensure that school is still on. This is a helpful resource and I don't know what I'd do without it. Another thing computers allow us to do is check the news. With the click of your mouse, you can check to see who won the presidency, or what shows are on tonight. Another amazing aspect of computers is that they improve eye-hand coordination greatly. This not only benifits my mom who checks her email five times every minute, but my little three year old sister who loves to move the mouse around, and type in random letters on documents. It could entertain her for days, but most importantly, it helps improve her eye-hand coordination every second she sits in that chair. This improved skill will help her enourmously in her future when she soon begins to play sports, and ride bikes. Finally, computers allow millions of friends and family to communicate daily at no cost. If classmates forgot to write down homework they can email the teacher instantly, and know exactly what the homework is and even open the sheet that the teacher attached, and print it out. A couple of weeks ago, my dad went to @LOCATION1 for thirteen days, and it was outragously expensive to talk to him on his phone. So, every couple days, he video chatted with me instead so I could talk to him. hear what he was doing, and even see the view of @LOCATION2 from his window. This was very special to me and could not have been done without computers. As it is so plainly clear, computers help us in so many ways that we forget about like educating us, improving our eye hand coordination, and allowing us to communicate with friends and family. These are just a couple of the positive affects and benifits that computers provide us with.",10
362,"Knoleg is one of the greatest quests for mankind, always trying to figure out how and why things happen. @CAPS1 to this natural ciricusity we have made amazing leaps in Technology @NUM1 years ago what seemed to be imposible is now possible. And one of those many thought to be impossible was to find anything you want in only a matter of seconds. I think computers are a great benafate to society becaus, you can learn things around the world in the blink of an eye, allow you to talk to people around the world and @CAPS5 give you better hand eye cordenation. The first reson I think that computers are great modern society, is that we can learn instantly about foren countrys. @NUM1 years ago the only way you could learn about places far away was if you read it in a newspaper, many which didn't tell you about faraway lands. Now with the internet we can learn around the world what is happening ware you want to know. ""@CAPS1 to our modern techolagy people are now more informed about the rest of the world than ever befor."" stated @PERSON3, a @CAPS2 expert from @ORGANIZATION2 university of @CAPS2. ""@CAPS4 computers and the ability to colect information @CAPS7 quily compared to @NUM1 years ago."" @CAPS5 @CAPS9 computers we wouldn't have known anything about the recent earth quake in @CAPS6. @CAPS5 with computers we can now talk istantly with people over the internet. A century ago talking to people instantly seemed just about impossible. But @CAPS1 to technology that of thing is an avarage part of our lives."" @CAPS7 many of our advancements and dicisions are made while we talk online, even some of the worlds gratests leaders make the hard decisions becaus of this advansments,"" stated @PERSON1, a reporter for the new @CAPS8 times. ""@CAPS9 this technology many of the decisions made in @LOCATION1 and @CAPS10 wouldn't be made and many solders would have died as a result."" @CAPS11 final reson that I support this decision is that they help teach you hand eye coordination. One of the ways that computers teach hand eye coordination is throug video games and simulations. In video games people make it @CAPS7 you to react at a movements notes in order to compleat your objective. In the @ORGANIZATION1 computer simulations teach the soldiers how to react to many different situations. Through this situations, many sledres have learn how to servive in combat and save many of their fellow comredes. ""The simulations we have invested in have improved combat effectevness by over @PERCENT1"" stated general @PERSON2 of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS12. ""@CAPS9 theise simulations many more american lives weold have ben lost in recent wars."" @CAPS14 now that you have heard all of @CAPS11 resons of why I support computers. I hope you are much more informed about this topic @CAPS9 computers we wouldn't be able to learn about foren lands, talk to people instantly, or have as good hand eye cooordination. I hope everyone else will see @CAPS11 resons for supporting computers.",10
363,"Dear local newspaper I don’t agree with the people who say people spend to much time on their computers. Because people can lean mostly anything they want all of a computer also there are lots of resomes why people should use advances technology they can teach kids how to find out answers to there homework the fastway instead of reading a book or taken a class and still get the full understeading. The people that say others spend's to much time on there computers are also right about that but they still can interact with friends and family they can play games, speak to each other, even learn new things together, all through a computer. One thing they were right about was to go out and enjoy the nature you cant do that on a computer but you can help the nature on a computer like try to put up a blog. Something that people make so others can see and spred the word and on that blog it can stay stop cuting down trees for stores or stop killing animales for there far or anythin you wont to write. So the people that do read this you should agree with me because you can do lots of things on a computer and learn lot more then you ever thought you could. So go out and find you a computer and find somethine you need to do or learn or just to have some fun.",8
364,"Dear @PERSON2 ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1"" I'm sure you all have heard the sound of a mouse or people typing if you have walk into an office, our local library, a doctor's office, or even our districts schools. The reality is that computers and the world-wide-web is seem and used everywhere. Without a computer, how would @CAPS3 be able to access our emails, interact with family memmber across the ocean and finish that research paper out teacher has assigned us? In my opinion, computers hace a phenomenal affect on people and their lives. The computer helps develope hand-eye coordination, learn about specifil subjects and interact with people on the computer. Therefore, with such positive affects, @CAPS3 should keep using this wonderful technology and get our jobs done. Have you ever walked into your schools lab or walked into a office building and all you could hear was the clicking of mouses or the buttons being pressed down on the keyboard? Well, not only is a job being completed, but you are also exercising I remember last month when my class was assigned a five page essay. After the second page, my hands hurt very badly, @CAPS4, not only was i completing my essay, I was also exercising my hands. Not only does computers allow you to exercise, it also helps develops hand-eye coordination. Have you ever played a game where you had to cath fist, or playes a fast-pasle game of pinball? Well, those games require one key thing i hand-eye coordination. Computers are very helpful in todays world. The computer and the world-wide-web is useful in several other ways too. The internet also allows you to learn about certain subject or events you might not have a book for. My bestfriend, @PERSON1, called me one day from the train. On the phone, she was frantic because she was giving a speech and she did not know what the statistic was for type @CAPS5 diabetes. What do you do when you have no book for a specific subject? @PERSON3 went on her laptop and found all the information she she dit not know. this is just another way the quick acces to a computer benefits people. ""You've got mail"" I'm sure you have all heard this before. Besides communicating through letters or on the telephone, the internet has also given us more ways for fast communication. when you need to confirm a meeting place or ask your classmate what problems were assigned homework, what could be a fast mean of communication? Sending a instant message, or e-mail are two ways of course. Not only does computers allow you to communicate quickly but also privately. Both your e-mail account and you instant message account have passwords so that only you can access them. Every four out of five households have a computer avalable for completing assignments, checking, e-mails and learning about the, that happend in @LOCATION1 last week. The computer has put a positive affect on numerous people and their everyday need. In my opinion, the computer has been one of the best technologies in history. This amazing technology has helped students, teachers, doctors, police officers and even you bank aggents serve our community and make it a better one. Thank-you.",11
365,"Dear @CAPS1 of the Newspaper, @CAPS2 is no doubt that computers don'@CAPS6 benefit society. First of all, most people only have a limited amount of time to things. Secondly, many friends would get mad if you can'@CAPS6 see them. Last but not least, you have to watch out for your health. To sum up, computers aren'@CAPS6 always a good thing. From my point of view, time is a big thing. When people get so involved with something, its hard to back away. Thats just like smoking. The nicotine attracks you so once you start, it is very hard to quit. Many lazy people like to put things on hold. In other words, you waste time. The time that you could be spending on homework or even working on a job, your wasting it. Other people know that they need to do something but keep putting it off. For example, you need to paint your house or fix the motor in the car but you keep putting it off. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people do this in @LOCATION1 everyday. As you of all people can see, many @CAPS3 don'@CAPS6 think too much about time. The next big topic is @CAPS4. You and I both know that every one needs a @CAPS5. When you don'@CAPS6 interact with your Friends, your friends might not bother trying to talk to you. The might not even go near you if you forget about them. Pets on the other hand need you. They usually just sleep around the house when they are lonely. I'm sure that you know pets need love and need you to play with them. Parents need to be @CAPS2 for their kids. When you were little, didn'@CAPS6 you need help? I know I did. Thats why parents need to interact a lot. In conclusion, the more you stick with your friends and stay away from the computer the better you will be. That leads us to the next big topic, health. Staying healthy's no joke. If you want to live long and watch you rkids grow up, the healthier you are the hotter you'll be. Everyone needs exercise. Exercise helps prevent against diseases as well as keepin gyou in shape. @NUM3 out of @NUM1 eople are over weight. When you are sitting in front of a computer screenplay games or sending e-mails, that's just as as palying video games on your @CAPS6.V. You know as well as anyone, most video games are not good for you. Last but not least, most people don'@CAPS6 eat healthy when they play video games or go on the computer. You and I both know, a healthy diet and exersice will give you a happy life. From my point of view, computers don'@CAPS6 benefit society. Time is a big thing which many @CAPS3 don'@CAPS6 realize. Secondly, @CAPS4 which everyone needs is another important thing to look into. Last but no least, everyone everywhere needds to stay healthy. For a long happy life. As you can see, many people would be better off without computers!",10
366,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are very dangerous to the modern day socity and how we are connected to them. So I belive that these atroshish things should bery well be disposed of. There are good reasons of thinking such a thought that is in this time with such an eviormetal breakdwon we need to get close to nature while it's still here. Next today our interaction is very low when if your talking about actuall talking to the person and because of computers it makes @CAPS3 all the more lazy while sitting around doing nothing. Lastly the @CAPS2 is harmful and expensive not to menshon the fact that the enviorment is already falling apart. The way natures heading we will all end up dieing no thanks to computers. First how hamful it today is @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 own computers. In america theres only @PERCENT2 is nature with nice forest but as people reporduce more will be gone forever due to expantion. So be one of the @NUM1 out of @NUM2 that instead of staing iside views the great things the earth has to offer. Next these computers our little robots that are really taking over the world and its getting very dangerous with how much it's destroying the ability for humans to breath this happens because theres a hipno disk in all computers making us stay close sufficating us like a deadly drug it's a horrible addiction. Lastly @PERCENT3 of deaths are due to @CAPS2 overloads imagene all the lives that could be saved if they just went to breath every @NUM3 minets I mean on average @NUM4 hours a day your looking at a @CAPS2 take time off make a goal for say @NUM5 hours. This addiction will kill us and knone knows how to talk about it. Secondly, millions on top of millions live in the @LOCATION1 @NUM6 keep on their computers for ours on a time you would think that their alone in every @NUM7 people are done the rest are being killed by chatting on the @CAPS2 and letting their life flow right out of the window. Now interaction is harmful as you already know but you forgot @NUM8 a day do elligal things on the internet like download music wich they shouldn't be they could be put away for up to @NUM9 years for this talk about an iteraction, with the police. Lastly web inter action like myspace they haves satified sexual effenders who could come to your house at only time and take you away would you like that to happen you could never see your family in every @NUM10 people @PERCENT4 are kidnapped due to myspace alone stand up out of danger. Thats a harmful work it is. Finally the dangers of a world like this with how the government whats to mess you up. These people are considered are mad and dangerous with laywars who want to get you. One in every @NUM11 people can't keep up with payments. Next did you forget about those other @PERCENT3 who dont have computers they are living the life walking with @CAPS4 on the edge of myth. Lastly and unfortunatly those @PERCENT1 perstent witho computers are likly to die within the next @NUM12 years due to a dealy poisin that the compute diliveres to your brain. In conclution this world can be one of the more angerest. So come to gether get a friend go for a run now and then. No friends go talk see your family instead of one of those vertual meaings. Just keep in mind the dangers of the @CAPS2 world and how it wants your money. Now what we need to do is attak the robots back. People should go for a run cut of some of the obisity from sitting down all day lose @NUM9 pounds or more. Remember the world would survive if you trash that zombie @CAPS2 room. Get outside go for a road trip save life humanity your fellow niebor your family.",10
367,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think that more people should start using computers. They can offer things that just writing things down or a pece of paper cant, like being able to learn about things that aren't taught in school, you can talk with friends online and you can keep everything in one. The first reason I think more people should use computers is that they can learn about things that arent taught in. Such as current events, the history of our nation and how our government works. Now some people can argue that you can learn about current events on @CAPS1 or a newspaper. But the computer can give you the news in an article then show you it in a video. Also in my opinion the news from the internet is visually less condensed than on @CAPS1. Another reason I think more people should use computers is that you can talk with friends over the internet. This is great because there @MONTH1 be people you havent seen in awhile because they moved. I had a friend who moved to pitsburg when I was @NUM1 and when I got u @CAPS3 account I was able to find him and talk with him a while of him visiting. Or you can just keep in touch with friends that so to a different school. The last reason I think people should use computers is that you can keep pictures, videos, document and contacts on your hard time. This is important to because I am not very well organized when it comes to school. But I started using my book and started to some of the work on the computer. This helped me be less clutteres and keep all my work in our place. It also means you can email that walk to a teacher or notes a friend who might have missed school that day. So in conclusion that or why I think we should have peple we computers more. They can help you learn, let you talk with friends, or let you keep everything in one place. That is why I think more people should use computers.",9
368,"@ORGANIZATION1, In ones opinion about computers and what they can do to benefit society these days. Ones opinion about what the effects that computers have or people are that they can benefit us in many ways for example they can communicate with people around the world for example many people @MONTH1 have friends or family that live in another state or country computers can help us communicate with them. Commputers alow us to help us learn what we couldn't learn from books. Computers can help us with learning such as learning about or the population. One might think that is good but its slow with computers you can send emails and have the person on the other end reply instantly because of computers. Computers have benefited society in many ways. Computers in ones opinion about them is that they can benefit us in many ways we wouldn't think of being possible. Before computers and printers we had in use type writers and if you messed up you would have start again and it could take hours or work to get the paper perfect but with the worlds modern we would don't have to type whole paragraph over again if we make a mistake we can just hit the back space button on the keyboard so it won't take us hours to type one page or when it take half an how at most so computers have benefited us in more way than we know it. So in ones opinion about computers and what they can do to benefit us is that they allow us to do things we couldn't have done before the computer was invented. The computer was a great invention and it is benefited mankind as we speak and that it is that hard to set up. So in ones opinion about computers and what they do that can benefit the society that we live in and also benefit mankind as well.",8
369,"As time goes on, our society becomes more advanced with more and more unnecessary technology, such as the television. What I really want to write about is the computer. Society today has developed a very unhealthy habit, and it is always using the computer. Everyone in the twenty first century uses a computer. The world got so used to having the computer around, that if all the computers in the world were to ""break,"" then most people probably would not know how to @CAPS2. Like the basic theory of. Which was that the world was ""@CAPS1"" to end back in the year two-thousand because everyone thought that the world was going to end. Only because the computer were going to crash and lose all the data that we have ever recorded. Humanity relies way to much on the computer. Since many people rely on the computer to @CAPS2, a lot of people ""forget"" to excersise! Our body needs excersise to live. Excersise one of the most important activities in our daily lives. When you don't excersise, and all you do is eat junk food and drink today, you better bet on your mothers grave that your going to either get diabetes, the fly, heartburn, or any other sickness or disability. You are what you eat is what I say. Life already has enough distractions in it, why add another distraction? All the computer is, is a distraction from keeping you and everyone else healthy. The computer started off as an ""innocent"" invention. Now a days, people literally worship the computer like it is a @CAPS3. People who use the computer all day every day, end becoming very lazy, because all they want to do is sit down and use the computer. In my opinion, everybody should be a part of some physical activity. Whether it is basketball, football, baseball, track, tennis or my favorite thing to do, skateboarding. Everyone should get physically active atleast three times a week for many reason, fact is, that if you excersise three times a week at the least, that your body will function better, you will look better, and you will feel better. excersise can be fun, as long as you make it fun. I hope this essay has really made you think about how you want to live. excersise should be a huge part of your daily routine, now sitting on your buttox all day searching pointless videos on ""youtube."" The way you want to live your life is up to you. And I hope to @CAPS3 that you start living it healthier.",9
370,"To use computors, or not to. That is the question. Hundreds of millions of people use computors in their daily life today, but some believe that using computors does not benefit society. It is my firm beleif that they do. Computors provide entertainment, a way to interact with people, and a nearly endless expand of knowledge. Without them, we would quickly find life to be much harder and less fun to navigate. Have you ever been in your house on a rainy day just sitting around bored because there is nothing on @CAPS1? Well I have on many ocations. When that happens, all you have to do is turn on the computer and you have endless choices at your fingertips. You can go on game sites and play thousands of different games. (this can also help improve your hand-eye coordination). You can also watch movies or @CAPS1 shows that you missed or want to watch again. You can even go on sites such as fanfiction.net, and read or write your own stories! Another reason why computers benifit society is that they help you interact with people. You can keep in touch with far away family members and friends using webcams email, and chat sites without the bill that would come with talking on the phone. You can also meet new people from different countries and become their. That way you learn about different ways of life and cultures. You can also quickly contact people in an emergency get updates on events, and comunicate with your teacher if you have a question about your homework. Lastly, and maybe even most importantly, computers are on enormous source of knowledge. Say you wanted to learn how to start a campfire, you could just search, ""how make fire"" a google and @NUM1 matches would be found seconds. Also, if you were asigned a project for school, you could do all of your research easily from your computor, then type the whole thing up on a word document. You can even get a college degree online if you wished. And if you want to find a resturant that specializesin @CAPS2 cooking, you can find one close to you, get directions to it, look at the menu, see the prices get the restaurant's history, cud find reveiws for it all on one magnificent little choice: your computer. So you see, computors benifit society greatly. In fact I don't think we could live without them. They provide us with entertainment, an easy way to interact with people, and a huge source of information. Now, to all of you people who still think computors are bad; I'd like to see you lost a week without using one.",10
371,"Dear @CAPS1, I, agree that computers are benefits society. The computers have positive effect on people like hand-eye coordination. I helps you learn about other country religios, and other thing. You can communicate, meet other people, and chat tru computers. Another positive fact about computer is that you can find all the information you need and fast. In other words is that computer help a lot of people.",4
372,"You are the @NUM1 visitor, click here to get your prize! That is normal thing that will @CAPS4 up on computers, they can give you viruses, and people can get your personal information. That is one reason computers are bad. On top @DATE1 that, ""@CAPS1 @DATE1 computers more than @NUM2 kids are obducted each day!"" says @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @DATE1 the missing child agency. They get obducted @CAPS1 kids go on @CAPS6 rooms and get themselves into trouble. On another note we rely on computers to much, it not healthy for us. ""@CAPS4 up ads cause many problems,"" says @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 @CAPS5. More than @PERCENT1 @DATE1 people in the world have computers. This was from a world wide poll in @DATE1. More than @PERCENT2 @DATE1 that is kids. When kids are on computers they always click on the @CAPS4 up ads. These ads cause catastropic problems! Peoples computers get viruses, identities get stolen, and credit card information gets found out. Therefore with those things happening you are going to yell at your kids, but you can't blame them they just thought they were going to get a free xbox @NUM3. Now that I have told you about @CAPS4 ups let me tell you about chating. Chating on computer is just a bomb waiting to be set off. ""@CAPS6 rooms are the main why. Now that I have told you about chating let me tell you about how people rely on them to much. Instead @DATE1 looking up what a book was about, just read it! Everyone thinks a computer is the answer to every problem when in reality @PERCENT3 @DATE1 the things on the internet are false, says Technology @CAPS7 a magazine that deals with the disadvantages @DATE1 technology. I remember when I needed to know if my flight to @LOCATION1 was cancled, so I went on google and looked it up. The website I went on said it was cancled but later when I called the airport just to make sure it had been they said it took off when it was scheduled to! And instead @DATE1 an e-mail just send a letter! Do you want your kids obducted @CAPS1 fo @CAPS6 rooms? @DATE1 course not, and do you want to miss your flight for vacation? No I dont think so, computers are very bad and are used to often. No one wants their identity stolen @CAPS1 @DATE1 some @CAPS4 up ad. We need to do things on our own more often and stop relying on computers to do everything for us!",9
373,"@ORGANIZATION1, Are technology is advancing greately and more inventions are coming out; but aren't you worried that people spent to much time on the technology? I know @CAPS1 worried. For example computers. Computers have to technology to go online and chat with various people all around the world. Thas when I get worried. In this essay I will explain why it is bad to spent too much time on computers. it is bad because people don't execisi enjoy mothers nature, and interact with family and friends. Firstly, people are for geting how important it is to excaise. It is very important because it keeps you fit and healthy. With the computers in use people become less fit and healthy. They start getting fat theire carasaprel get high and they stress more. Secondly they don't enjoy mothersnature. When people start going on the computers they stop doing a lot of things. Like stop going outside and getting fresh air. They get c losed in a small bubble and all they case about is the computers. They don't go out to camp, play outside; they don't do nothing. Every day they are on the computer. Finaly, one big main problem is: they stop inter acting with family and friends. When mothers and fathers are oh it they don't pay attention to these young ones and they are always on it. When teenagers are on the computers they don't talk to these parents, they ignore there friends and the people that care about them most. They wont care for everybody, but them selfes @CAPS2 there you have it; that is why I think we should cut down on the computer usage. For these following reasons: People stop exercising and being fit. They stop enjoiying mother nature, and they stop @NUM1 with family and friends. @CAPS2 what do yoo think?",8
374,"Dear local newspaper, I disagree with the affects that computers have on kids. Computers lets kids do what they want and They dont have to travel far to see certin things. Like if you wanted to see the @LOCATION1's @CAPS1 your not just going to get a plane and fly there when you could get pics and information right on the computer in a couple minutes. Its good if you want to see it in person but you wont want to pay money for plane tikets or travel really far when you can just see it from home. Computers have a lot of fun stuff on them like myspace, @CAPS2, and games also its got almost everything you can think of. So why travel when you can see all of it on your computer. I think that computer can sometimes be a little adictive but you got to learn to stay off of it most of the time but it is very easy to learn stuff on a computer. Computers are used by billions and they a great way to learn stuff about are whole world and the things that are on it. It has information web sites like google or bing to look up anything you want to look up. Computers are almost everywhere in phones, I-pods, and even some are put in car like police cars. Computers are very useful to people of the world @DATE1 I bet that the people who make them will make new ones that can go on almost everything. They have computers in almost every building like hospitials, fire stations, police stations, and electronic stores like radioshack. Your going to learn a lot more on computers than having to travel places and or school. In my mind we should all have computers because there fun and you can learn about everything you could think of so we should all have them. So i think that computers are very useful and can teach you a lot about the things that go on in our world to day so I disagree with what scientist or people say about computers and the affects it has on certin people of @DATE1.",8
375,"Would you ever think that a computer can take to much time or keep you from doing lots of things. Does using a computer mess up your life in some ways I would say no. The computer is common life everybody needs it or uses it in some way of form. People need it because they look a news when they could not catch it on @CAPS1 so they go to the amazing technoliga. We have witch is the @CAPS2.C of laptops or phone with internet. This just is a natural thing in are lifestyle now the computer does not stop you from going outside and playing other things its you say no I love this tecnoligy do much that I want to stay on it. So does the computer mess up someones life in anyway or is it just you. The beautiful things a @CAPS2.C can do for you. A computer can do lots of things for you wont want to leave it and go do other things, like you have lots of home work and a project that you need I @CAPS4 for so you go do your work and you can also listen to music and type your project and doing things even though your not outside playing and being active doesn't mean that your not doing somethings better for your life like typing faster for a job when you get older and nowing how to use a @CAPS2.C good and not being out of touch with family there is cameal. @CAPS2.C's have been around for a long time and eversince this world has had them we have been smarter more talented in most ways and kids and adults are in touch with wats going around us and how the world is acting technology has helped many people when they needed something done in a rush or for mostly everything they have been around for things the @NUM1 year old people can still go. Research things that they have never known. And find out billions of aplications for it. Although most people stay on for long periods of time but they cant stay on all day without say hi to family and talking to them.

So would you think that a computer is tacking to much time in a persons day and they are not spending enogh time with family or is it just that compturs are a all natural thing that everybody needs.",8
376,"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever wondered how to get somewhere and you didn't have a map or @CAPS1 near you and the only thing that was the near you was a @CAPS3. Well I am saying you should go on it and search were you want to go. Computers are very helpful in every one's daily life they have so many facts and interesting things on them, @CAPS2 about again trying to figure out were someone lives it's very easy, go on google and type in someones's adress and there you go. The @CAPS3 is also very good because have you ever thought about one of your friends or a special someone and you havent seen them in like a really long time and you miss them well no problem mostley all computers have some sort of camera in them were you could video chat or just chat regular on the enternet. That is very helpful because even though you could just go on the phone and call them it's better to do it online because how about if you havent seen them you want to see a picture of them they could just send it to you on some sort of chat page or just your email. It is so much better then mailing one picture in the mail and it takes days for the mail to come if you could do it the faster way on line and on video chat it will be better.. The @CAPS3 is also very helpful because how about one day you want to go some were and you dont know what the weather is going to be well you could go to put on the tv and see but there is so many communications and you cant really see because they move the weather days fast. On the @CAPS3 you could type the weather in for one week and it will tell you and you could look at it for as long as you want and it will stay there so you could see the whole week without the screen having fast as the image is not in the light light or if it's to dark. The @CAPS3 is so helpful. People do say that it is good to get off the @CAPS3 and go for a walk outside in nature I do agree with that but people and children do get their exercising by walking around the house and going outside going shopping. Computers are helpful and nice and another thing is say one day you are online and you are looking at clothes or shoes and you want to buy them but you dont want to go to the mall a half hour away from were you live you could just buy them online and they will be shipped to your house and you dont even have to lift a fingure. They are also good because they have like a dictionary on it were if you dont know how to spell a word you type it in the best way you can and it corrects your spelling and tells you what the word is, also the computers have pictures of everything, if you want to see how something looks like you can type it in and shows you. with all the facts I have given you I hope you agree with me that computers are very helpful nice and safe.",9
377,"Dear Local Newspaper, I heard what you were saying about if computers are a good or bad thing. I personally think that compueters are a bad thing. Three reason for this are, kids don't get any exercise people are doing innapropirate things on them, and they could lead to giving out too much info, which could lead to injury or death. The first reason is that for the amount of time that someone uses a computer, they could be outside enjoying the nice weather well, if it is a nice day of course! I mean you have to agree with me on this one, the main reasons why people are becoming obese because of some kind of technology computers. The second reason why computers are a bad thing is because some people are doing innapropriate thing on them. If people are doing such innapropriate things on them why don't the makers of the computers block them? I don't know, I mean what kind of sicko would put those sites up even? From what I have learned in computer class, they can be used for more innapropriate things than I ever even knew of! The @CAPS1 and final reason why computer technology could be a bad thing is because some people have given too much info away on them and have gotten injured by internet world @MONTH1 look like fun and games untill someone gets hurts, well thats what my mom says! In conclusion, as you can probally see I am really not a fan of the computer. The reasons why I don't like it are kids don't get enough exercise, kids are doing innapropriate things in it, and it has been used for injury and sometimes death. These are the reasons why the computers is a bad thing, so remember these tips, take this article into consideration.",7
378,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positieve effect on people. They do because you can talk to others online, it allows you to get research done faster and they are much more efficent and easy to use i will further explain my reasons. First of all, computers allow you to talk to others online. Talking to others online can give you good communication skills and you can get to know different people. I always talk to my friends online. We talk to each other using webcams, instany messaging, or talking on a social site like facebook. Computers and webcams can allow you to talk to friends who have moved away or for relatives. Next, computers allow you to get research done quicker. Studies shown that @PERCENT1 of people prefer using a computer to find information for any type of paper than an enclyepdia or other book. Computers are much more efficent and easier to use than books. It can agree that computers are much more efficent and that i like to use them. If you use a computer to get research done than you can be done sooner than you know it. Finally, computers are more efficent and easy to use. If you give a person to coose from a computer or a set of encyelpedias, most people would choose the computer. Computers are so much easier to use than books. On the comuter you just type in what you are looking for in search bar a boom within a tenth of a second your results are there. Now, if you use a book or enclyelpedia it could take several minutes to find what you are looking for, and then they only give very little information, unlike a computer that can give you millions of results for one topic. This proves that computer are more efficent than books. In conclusion, i believe that computer have a posieve effect on people. I do because you can talk to people online, it allows you to get research done quicker, and computers are more efficent and easy to use. I hope you will agree with me and my thoughts about computers.",8
379,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have affect on people because firstly, it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. Secondly, it allows people to talk online with friends. Thirdly, gives online games to little kids. Lastly you can wacth video's that can teach you all sorts of exotic things. My first reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. For example if I want to go to @LOCATION4 for the @DATE1 and I know nothing about the place I can go online and look up I can look up their foods, their culture, their villages, and even there landscapes. Also the computer is good for book reports if your teacher told you to do a book report on @LOCATION5 instead of going in your text books, goion line you can look up their culture, there food, there location, how is there economy like, what kinds of school the kids go to what kinds of festivals they have etc. My second reason computers have affect on people is because it allows people to talk online with other people whenever they want. For example there are @NUM1 things that let you talk on the computer and that is @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 these two allows you to talk to friends that live faraway from you, my friend lives in @LOCATION1 and I live in @LOCATION2 we don't have cellphones so we go online to eiether @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 ""isn't that great""!!. The computer also allows you to talk from faraway places like if you live in @LOCATION3 you can talk to somebody else in @LOCATION6. My third reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives online games to little kids. For example when I say games I mean educational games like reading games, math games, writing games, etc. Statistic say the @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT1 of kids learn more things on the computer than they learn in school that a huge percentage even for kids. Also when kids play computer games it more fun to them then sitting in class all day like my litt ",8
380,"Computers were built to help the people make tasks easier and quicker. Since then, they have been updated over and over untill what they are today. Computers are a part of most peoples everydaylives, and essential to most bussiness.But the common question in our society is, are computers really benefitting us? My answer is yes. Computers do many things for us. They teach us hand-eye coordinatin, give us the ability to research effectivly, and recently, became a great way of communication, @CAPS1's are definately benefitting us. One reason why computers help us is by teaching hand-eye coordination. In a magazine I read, one expect, (@PERSON1) said that leading to type without looking is a great way of improving reflexes. The speed that you type is improved with practice. Another way it improves hand-eye coordination is by learning to click and react to different things effectively. I often on being ammused by playing games on the computer. These games usually are hard, but with my improving hand-eye coordination, I am learning how to play these games well. My father always tells me to learn my way through a computer because they are our future, soon, mostly everything will be done by them with the improving technokolgy, it is impossible for it not to be benificial to our society. Our home computers have been great at teaching me thing like hand-eye coordination. Another reason why computers are great is by making that tough history paper, just a click away. My garndfather always tells me how easy I have it. Instead of going to the @CAPS2 and having to pick out a book, I just go to google and have an entire search engine infront of me. When we go into highschool we will need a computer to suceed. To keep our essays organized, our research effective, and the clear to read typing right infront of us. My brother tells me that having a computer is the best investment has ever made. Last year, we had a science assignment to figure out how our heart beats faster. This way very easy considering I typed it in and had hundreds of ways to increase my pulse rate. Computers have changed the way we research and finish school works. The last reason why computers are fantastic is beacuse they make communication just a click away. A couple weeks ago, my coach emailed us that our gametime has changed. This doesn't seem like a big thing, but without his @CAPS1, we would've missed the game. My cousin @CAPS3 is from @LOCATION1. Me and him meet only once a year. With that limited time, we can't really get out what we need to. Recently, i bought a webcam and have been chatting with him on it every week. It is almost like he's with me. All the girls in our school can't get enough of me. So I get home after sports, go on, and theres always enough of me to go around. Webcamming is a great way of communication. With all the new computer going on sale and new appliances coming no one knows when it will stop. Well, the question still lingere, are computers benificial to our society? The answer @MONTH1 never come about, but at least for me, improving hand-eye, researching being a breeze, and communication just waiting for me is a pretty sweet deal. So for now, I stand by the opinion that computers are great, and extremely useful to everyone.",9
381,"Dear local Newspaper, People spending time on the @CAPS1 is a good way for people to connect with one each other. But it can also be a way for people to get in trouble with things online like looking at things they shouldn't be looking at strangers they shouldn't be talking or typing to or even predators that could be online. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 kids and adults go on the computer either when their getting out @ORGANIZATION1 school for the day or if they are getting off @ORGANIZATION1 work for the day or if they are getting off @ORGANIZATION1 work for the night, they are just there on the computer to check upon things and for the kids either for their entertainment, for like chatting with friends on some king @ORGANIZATION1 program, or @ORGANIZATION1 their even playing a game online. Three fourths @ORGANIZATION1 kids under age @NUM1 go online more than adults age @NUM2 because @ORGANIZATION1 the interest in what is on it. People sometimes say, ""oh, I only go on the computer to check up on things. It only takes me a few minutes"", But they are lying. Most people dont just go on for a couple @ORGANIZATION1 minutes, their on for more like a few hours, and that effect their relationship or connection to ones family and or friends. @PERSON1 at the @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""people spend hours on the computer looking at what ever they want and most people do that and it has to stop for the sake @ORGANIZATION1 the persons family and friends,"" @PERSON1 also said,"" @CAPS2 like an addiction"". Do you really want to have an addiction? I didn't think so, so instead @ORGANIZATION1 just sitting there storing into a screen for hours aday go outside and have fun with your friends or family, go to the @CAPS3, the beach, even just take a walk in the park. Nothing can beat the feeling @ORGANIZATION1 being with friends or family and just having fun.",8
382,"Dear Newspaper, I think that the effects are okay as long as we get off the computers and go outside and see some friends and get some exercise. Computers let us not just talk to each other but it also lets us challenge each other on games without hurting each other it could even stop all ways all at once because we could challenge other countries in war games without killing real living people. We can check our taxes and stocks. It also makes it easier to find health insurance, car insurance, and house insurance. We can look up historical facts on the computer. We can look up how to stop snake venom from getting to your heart and how to make a how and some arrows to hurt with. You can find plumbers, technicians, oil companies, and lumber companies. you can find dates on the computer, too and find information about certain eople too.",6
383,"My opinion is that people spend to much time on computers and don’t concentrate on their family. Another reason is that people will not do school work if their to concentrated on the computer. My third reason is people wont enjoy hanging out with there friends. Those are my reasons now let me explain them. First, people will be concentrated on the computer and not their family. They will be focused on the computer way to much and not have fun with there family and friends. People ignore their parents when on computer. I know this because my sister goes on the computer and completely ignores my mom and dad when there talking to her. Please heed my advice or your kids will be ignoring you when you are talking to them. @PERCENT1 of children go on the computer and ignore everything. Now I can advance to the next reason. Second of all, peop concentrate to much on the computer that they dont do homework or any school work. If they dont do homework they could get bad grades on their report cards. If they get bad grades they could fail the marking period and stay back. Please listen or your child could stay back. Now for my third reason. Third, People wont enjoy hanging out with there friends. On the weekends you wouldn't want to be on the computer go out with your friends, enjoy yourself.",7
384,"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 these days are telling kids to go outside instead of vegging out in front of a computer. Computers can but promote bad habits. I try not to use the computer unless I have too for school or to get homework. Please consider the negative effects which are exercising in apropprate content and less interaction with friends/family. Yes internets can be used to find diets and exercise plans but if you would just go to the gym to burn of those pounds everything would be just fine! Internet and computers are designed to suck in your brain, and attack you to all the websites and neat little things. It is more effective just to go to a local @ORGANIZATION2 or @ORGANIZATION1 to work out. I swim on a swim team for a @ORGANIZATION2. I love swimming better than going on the computer. It satisfies my personal needs of exercising. I lost @NUM1 pounds by just swimming for a month. I will run on the tred mill to help me burn of stress or anger. Gyms are way better than computers. I know most of us have seen something inapropprate on the computer. Yes computers give people jobs but there is no need to post pictures or messages that will hurt peoples feelings. I know the other day I saw a really mean comment that made me feel bad for the victim. I know youtube is trying to stop inappropriate content, so hurray for them. Once you give something to the internet it is lost forever. Yes computers have ways to keep in touch with friends but it is better to @CAPS3 or visit in person. Like my @CAPS2 always said,"" @CAPS3 more, it builds character!"" @CAPS4 ever I get the chance I @CAPS3 my best buddies instead of using the computer. Kids theses days can be mean with out try. You disconnect yourself from your family. Because computers attrack users, there are times where you don't pay attention to others around you. @PERCENT1 of kids donot do there home work because of computers. Thank you for your time. I think computers are bad and everyone would be happy with out them. They help the obesity level in the nation, let cyber bullying and inappronrate content flow around the internet and lastly block you out from the world. ( @CAPS5.S someday computers are going to take over the world and you will be sorry you didn't listen to me.)",9
385,"Dear @LOCATION4 @ORGANIZATION2, Computers are a great invention but people are starting to dislike it. On the hand, I believe the computers put positive effects on people. First of all, they are a great way for kids to have fun: @CAPS1, people can learn very interesting facts. Lastly, it is a great way to communicate with friends and family. These are a few reasons I think computers put a positive effect on people. To begin with on a computer you can have a lot of fun by playing games. The computer saves money for a lot of us. For example, if you bought a game system it would cost well over @MONEY1 but on a computor you can find and play games for free. Not all games have to be like ""@CAPS2 of @CAPS3"" or ""@CAPS2 of @CAPS5"" they can be games about sports. Supose one student broke his leg and he love playing soccer. He could just on the computer and play a game of soccer even though he has a broken leg. People can @CAPS1 learn various facts right from their computers. The most important thing that computors are made for is to learn new things. No one in the @CAPS2 knows everything, but if every one put what they know into the computer than people can get learne any thing from them, I remember @CAPS6 my friend once told me about some guy named @PERSON2. I had no idea who he was so my friend started laughing at me, @CAPS6 I got home I searched him up and by the time I was done reading about him I knew more than my friend about @PERSON2. If he ever have a question in class and our teacher can't answer it he/she always tells us to either ""@CAPS7"" it or ""@CAPS8"" it. They both are search engines. Not only can you learn a lot from computers you can @CAPS1 communicate with people from different countries. What if @PERSON1 did not invent the telephone? How different would our life be me right now? Anyway most people use the computer to communicate nowadays. Whether it @CAPS9 or @CAPS10, or whether its @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS11 all are a great way to communicate with people. With tele phones it costs money to talk with people in a different country, but with the roputer it is absolutely freen. You could be living in @LOCATION1 and chatting with someone in @LOCATION5. You could live in @LOCATION2 and email someone in @LOCATION3. Communication every where is fast and easy with the computer. My whole family lives in @LOCATION6 and it costs us twice as much to make a call there. @CAPS6 we use the computer it is even better because they can even see our fare throught the webcam. As you can see, computers are not negitive at all for all I know is that help people around the @CAPS2. They help kids have fun with the games we can play. @CAPS1, it teaches children and adults various now things. Lastly, it is a great communication strategy. I hope that you put those reasons in our local paper so every one can see how computers have a positive effect on people.",11
386,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, This leter I am writing to you is about how computers affect people. I am concerned about computers use in our society because people that spend too much time on the computer spend less time outdoors, exercising, and with family and friends. Let me tell you modre about it... As stated in the paragraph above, one reason I am concerned about computer use is that less time is spent outdoors.""Everyone, young or old, should get outside for some fresh air for at least @NUM1 minutes everyday,"" @PERSON2. Using the computer could limit this time, and that probably isn'@CAPS1 healthy being in the house all day. A second reason @CAPS1 worry shout over- usage of computers relates to the first reason. Too much time on the computer limits the amount of exercise you get everyday. ""People should exercise an hour a day to stay healthy,"" ssays health expert @PERSON1,"" however @PERCENT1 of people don'@CAPS1 because of computers."" this happens often especially if you are playing a fun game with many levels. You plan to play for @NUM2 minutes, but the @NUM2 minutes turns into @NUM4 minutes, which @MONTH1 even turn into an hour! I know still @MONTH1 be hard to understand why I'm concerned about using computers, @CAPS2 I have one more reason. My final reason in this letter of why I don'@CAPS1 like over using computers is that it limits the time that can be spent with family and friends. How of you can see your family and friends on the computer using a webcam. But it's not the same as spending quality time. ""Friends come and go and you and your family won'@CAPS1 live forever,"" says therapist @PERSON3"", @CAPS2 motor the best of that you have."" there won'@CAPS1 be many if you eyes are glued to the computer screen. As you can see there reasons why I am concerned about people spending time on the computer. There's less time to exercise enjoy nature and interact with family and friends. I hope you take this into concideration.",8
387,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 technology continues to become more and more enhanced so has the percentage of americans who use computers. @PERCENT1 of those americans, are children from the ages of @NUM1 to @NUM2. Most teens use the computer to interact with friends on social sites or spend a good chunck of their home playing online games. But what about the other teens; the ones who are constantly facing cyber bullying or are put in dangers way by talking to people they don't even know? To prevent these issues, I say we put a limit on our use of technology. Social sites, such @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and facebook, have been growing at an alarming rate. More teens would rather be on the computer than outside playing tag or on a swingset. I, myself, have an @CAPS2, facebook, and @CAPS3 and it's prevented me from getting exercise becaose it's almost like i'd rather be talking to my friends than going for a jog. It bothers me, it really does, but there is one question I always risk myself; how do I stop? I've been going on runs, studying more, and spending time with my family. There's ways and reasons to stop being so attached to technology, we just don't know how to get the message spread. Other than the affects social sites and exercise has had because of computers, online gaming is also a big issue too. Many kids, not mostly boys, to what I see at school are absolutely loving online gaming. But the only people that actually benefits in life are the website owners. These games are not educational, it's not a good why to spend a couple of hours of your time. So generally it's a waste. More important things should be done during this time like studying or doing homework. Just think, you could even hangout with friends doring that time rather than sharing on a monitor. Although computer gaming is a big reason why kids go on the computer, bullying is a huge factor along with stranger danger on chats. If, you're someone who's bullied constantly at school, you think being able to go home and spend time on the computer is amazing; until bulling came along. Cyber bullying can lead to a child working themselves, getting fights at school or even worse, someone's like taken because they didn't think it was worth living. Limited computer use or parental control would really help prevent this. Computer usage has its ups and downs,but my point is safety, health, and education, one the main issues we face because of modern technology. I'd like to hear that my letter to your newspaper was read. Please get back to me with your thoughts on this issue within the next three days by email.",9
388,"Dear Newspaper People, I think that computers do benefit society for a few reasons. Computers make work easier they can do things people can't like solve difficult problems, and kids like playing games on them. Computers make work easier and neater. Typing is often faster than writing, and is always easier to read. Studies have also shown that people who use computers to do work finish faster and have up to @PERCENT1 more free time to do whatever they want. Computers also have e-mail, which allows you to send work that you have done to your boss without printing it and wasting paper. Computers can solve difficult problems that people either can't do, or don't want to waste their time doing. If you need to solve a math problem you use a calculated or a computer. So you don't have to figure it out yourself. I have to do a lot of math problems for homework and I think it is much easier to use a calculator. My last reason why computers are good is that kids like playing games on them. A lot of people say that kids shouldn't play computer games but some of them are educational. Even non-educational games help kids to have fun and have something to look forward to after their work is done. @PERCENT2 of kids say that they are happier when they have something fun to look forward to, and happier kids do better work.

They also, allow people to talk to other people online. Lastly, computers are importat @CAPS2 people that work with them. there are many reasons why I believe that computers benefit our society. Do you know that computers give people the ability to learn about faw away places. Sometimes people, dont know when they want to leave the country. With a computer you can organize it all. Somoe people like my family, like to go visit their familys in other places, @CAPS2 example, once my mom told me we were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 to go visit our family she told me she already got the tickets on the computer. I was very happy when we went and I saw how beautiful @LOCATION1 is. Some people like to see new and beautiful places. Such as , @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2 and even @LOCATION4. Let me tell you about how computers allow people to talk to other people online. Most people have myspace and that allows kids my age to keep in touch. Also, facebook that you can and people that you probly havent seen in a long time. @CAPS2 exsample, one time I was looking aroung facebook and found my old bestfriend @PERSON1. I was so happy cause when she moved I thought i would never talk to her again. I am @PERCENT1 positive that everyone in this world has a yahoo you could find people really quikck and talk to them. Would you belive that there is so many jobs and responsibilities that require you to have a computer. Such as scientists they all have to have computers or else they wouldnt be able to invient all the great things they make. Also, secretaries they have asign dates @CAPS2 their bosses. @CAPS2 exsample, a secretary @CAPS2 doctor has to be able to give and to change appointments. Lastly, students that go to school and most importantly collage with no computers, they wont be able to do their homework. Most people would agree that computers have a positive affect on people. @CAPS2 the reasons that they give the ability to learn about faw away places, allow people to talk to other people online. Computers are very important to people who work with them.",10
390,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 editor, I have recently seen on the channel @NUM1 news that you want to know about the. Computers have on people. In the past, everyone has computers and gets knowledge from them. @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 surveyed at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 agree computers are helpful to us. In my opinion, computers have a positive effect on people. The first reason is computers teach hand eye coordination. Without this coordination, people would not survive. The users be over very quickly. The computer makes us use these muscles so we can live happily. @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 recently took a survey at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, agree computers are the main source of hand eye coordination. Dr. @DR1 expert in relationship to humans said, ""People without computers cant do what others can. They are unable to have fast reaction time."" To sum it up computers help with hand eye coordination. The second reason is computers allow us to learn about far away places. when you can't look up and learn about places, you are not about them. You're lucky if you know when in the world they are. Computers allow you to look up those places. You can look into going there for vacation or doing a report. @PERCENT2 of the adults who surveyed at the public library said the computers help. They are full of so much more information than books. To sum it up, computers allow you to learn about far away places. The third reason is computers allow you to talk online to people. This extends your friend ships with people. You can talk on the computer, not just at school. It also allows you meet new and different people. You can talk to people in @LOCATION1 that you couldn't talk to without computers. Computers allow you to open up the to all people. @PERCENT1 of parents who took a poll in @ORGANIZATION1 say they want their children to learn about different cultures. They need the computer for that task. To sum it up, computers allow you to talk online to people. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons are to teach hand eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk to people online. I strongly urge you to look at any point of view closely. This decision is now up to you. ",8
391,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I think, in my opinion, that computers benefit to society greatly. The reasons I believe this is because of @NUM1 main reasons: Computers are a limitless source of knowledge, there are websites with online communities and it's just plain fun to use. Computers, as we all know, are a limitless source of knowledge. Now then, as you know adults need to work A @CAPS2 so most of the time if someone has to research something for work they could use a computer. Even kids who go to school need to use the internet of the computer for something like a project or homework. Now I know everyone, kids and teens especially, love to talk to their friends so most people sign up for an online community website. Now I'm very aware of online pedophiles but that can be taken care of by the fact of having friends you know of in real life to sign up as well. Lastly, I have to say computers are just fun to use. Kids like me that normally have a long rough day at school like to come home and rest with some nice game on the computer. Now this sounds like it just lazy but it is something nice to do for a distraction to other things. And thats where I stand on terms of the endless knowledge, online communities, and just plain fun of the computer.",6
392,"Dear local newspaper, I agree with the people that support advances in technology. I believe computers have a positive effect on people because they can be used to learn, communicate, and entertain. My first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it can be educational. Many people believe computers are good for nothing. Even though they can be use for many things like research! For example, if you are a student you @MONTH1 need to do a project. Computers would be easier for you to collect research than a book. Another reason why computers are educational is because you can use them to read. You can buy virtual books that you can read right on your computer. Not only is that education but that also helps the environment because you would be saving paper. Sometimes you @MONTH1 simply be curious about something, your computer will be right their for you to use. Computers also have another positive effect on people, they can be used for communication. Nobody likes a distant family, but with a computer you can communicate with family and friends from all over the world! This effect is positive because it helps everyone stay in touch. Many people have very busy lives and don't have time in write a letter or make phone call. So, instead those people could just quickly and easily send a email no instant message to who ever they need to talk to. Some experts are concerned that people too much time on the computer and less time excercising, enjoying nature and interacting both friends and family. These experts don't realize that you can use a computer to instead with friends and family. A computer many family thing. You can watch movie as a family or multiplayes games together on the computer. on the computer is a postive effect because while doing on the computer as a family you would for example, using a computer to be entertaind is safer than doing something entertaining . Where you and your family would be to many dangers. There are various reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can be used to learn, communicate, and entertain. Those are only my main reasons they are many more. And that is why I support advances in technology and behave computers have a positive effect on people.",8
393,"Computers are becoming more advanced everyday, almost everyone owned, or owns a computer. I think, ther benefit society very greatly. One of the many ways is, they teach you hand eye coordination. So even @CAPS1 your playing games your hand-eye coordination @MONTH1 be improving. With hand-eye coordination you @MONTH1 need it to play sports like baseball. When do you need hand-eye coordination the most? I use it most, when I'm playing hockey or, baseball. So next time your on a computer, remember your hand-eye coordination is improving. Another reason we benefit from having computers, is we learn about far away places. @CAPS1, you know about places that are far away from you that you can or can't travel to, use a computer to gain some background knowledge @CAPS1 you travel somewhere on business and know nothing about it, what do you do? I know! get on a computer and do some research about it! An example of this is, @CAPS1 you have to fly out to @LOCATION1 and don't know anythin about it, use a laptop on the way over there. @CAPS1 you do that, you'll have some schema about the place. As you can see laptops and computers are great for learning of foreign countries. Finally, computers are great for learning a new language. You need to learn spanish in a couple of weeks. What will you do? Download a free language learning app. @CAPS1 you don't know a lot of french and need a few words but don't have a dictionary. Use a translator. When you are talking to someone from @LOCATION1 and you don't know there language use an english to african dictionary translation app on your computer. Computers have a great translater applications that are free so, @CAPS1 you don't know a language hop on a computer and learn it! In conclusion, computers are used every day and help us greatly, weather it be learning a new language, or just talking to friends. Computer benefit society greatly.",8

Now they just sign into aim, facebook, or myspace. Then they can talk in time. But thats only the good things here are the bad. People spend less time outside they don't look at any of the butey anymore. We don't spend time with our friends any more. I can't even remember the last time I had a face to face convetation with soemone if I didn't have to. People on the internet can do anything they want. You @MONTH1 be saying thats a good thing. Right? Well the answer is no! People can hack into almost everything. People can cyber bully others with out any one ever knowing who the other person is. People can also be any one they want online. Say if I was @NUM1 and I wanted to stalk so little @NUM2 years old I could also pretend that I was ten and pretend make friends with the ten year old. When I found out enough information I would then be able to find the ten year old. Before people wern't able to do this. If people start to see what is heppening with our exsistence the more people would stop being stached @NUM3 to their computers. People would start to cut down on the amount of time they spend on their computers and start to live. Take action! Take notice! Start spreding the word!",8
395,My opinion is that people should have computers in their homes. Computers should be for important things like searching for jobs and other things. People can do their work in the computer. To teach your childrens how to use a computer or let their children go on the internet to they can search kids stuff. People shouldn't all their time on the computers and spend less time with their families and friends. I think people should spend more time with their families and their friends then spending it on the computer. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. Probably your family are worried about people spending their time everyday in the computer. They their friends how to type in the computer and teach them some stuff about the history. Do you think that people should alot more time with their families and be happy about it the they are spending time with their families. I think people shouldn't use the computer when they have a vistor over their house they don't their vistor think you are attracted to the computer. They should give people the ability to learn about faraway places and to learn things about the internet. But not everyone agree that people shouldn't use computers because people can get attracted to it and people don't want that. To happen. And families are concerned about that a lot of people use this can of stuff. Other people think that this is a great idea to use a lot of computer and spend more on it then their families. So do you think that people should spend more time on their families and friends then picking atention to the computers.,8
396,"Dear Newspaper, I thought that I should express my concern. @CAPS4 are becoming to dependant on computers. @CAPS4 need to go outside more and be active. While some people @MONTH1 think were not wasting our time on the computer. I @CAPS3. I'll should only go on if it is nessesary. People are always coming up with @CAPS2 gaming ideas to draw people in, but what people dont realize is that is doesent only waste there time in waste our money too. Electricys bills are trough the roughtAlso instead og going out to meet @CAPS1 people are staying home and talking on social networking sites which make them less social. Children are not enrolling in sports which makes them losse any physical strength they would get. Also children could be getting over wait by just sitting there with no pysical activitys, @CAPS2 ideas like microsoft word is fine but going on every day for games is. Teachers, parent, and all need to show these that the computer is not the only thing, Computers can benifit us very well, by letting us have knoledge of somthing at the tip of our fingers. Computers can and will take away family and friend time. Now im not saying that computer but what am saying is that it effects everyone around you, @CAPS3 just the person thats using it. What @CAPS4 need to @CAPS3 is get together and unite. @CAPS4 need to go outside more, and exersise. @CAPS4 need to stop the computer with adults. Therfore, lets make this a better place. and get out and have a little time for going on to the computer.",8
397,"Dear Local Newspaper, Local newspaper do you think that the computer is a good technology in our generation today? Well I do not believe it is a good technology in our generation. Do not get me wrong. I do not like to go on the computer bat their are so many reasons why computers affect alot of children and some adults in this generation. Like one reason is when people are on the computer all day long they do not get enough exercise. That is why kids these days are so over wheight there are more than @NUM1 million children over wheight because of the computer . Like for me I use to love goin on the computer and I still do bat I see that the computer is dostroying my heatlh. A second reason why I believe is bad for the generation because there are alot of inapropreate sites on the internet, where kids that are @NUM2 and younger could be logging on to. I think that people all over the world should start enjoying nature, go travle the world. Start doing things that people cant do on the computer. I think that more kids should start interesting with family and friend more often. of talking to your friend all the time. My last and finally reason that is a big thing is going on in the computer is people bullying other people the internet, local newspaper have would you if you have any daughters, sons, grand and. If they was getting bullyed over that internet or concern them to kill them or hurty them. I think you would horribly and you would want that person to go to jail. For now on I am going to think when I spend all mu time on the computer how it affect my life and my family, friends. I belive other people in the world should do the same thing.",8
398,"Dear local Newspaper, Some people say computers have negative affects on family and friend others say computers are an important aspect of society. I would have to agree with the second group of people. Computers help students research information that they @MONTH1 need for school. People can talk to there friends on things like facebook or @CAPS1 and you can write a rough draft on the computer save it then go back to it and make the final changes from a draft to a final. I will elaborate in the following three paragraphs. Computers are a quick and easy way to look up information for a school project or paper. I can understand people thinking that computers take away from family time but so would a book. A book would probably take up more time and you @MONTH1 get less information. For example the book could be about multiple people and you read the entire thing only to get two sentences of information. Another reason computer reasearch is quicker is that you can go from one page get some information and then once you have gotten all the information from that page but you still need more you can just click another link. If people didn't have computers they would have to go to the library and spend time looking them. Is it worth it to use all that time. People can talk to there friends on facebook or @CAPS1. Some people say computers distract you from friends when really they help you talk to your friends more. What if your on vacation and your so tired of seeing and talking to your family because you've been with them non stop for a week and you miss your friends. All you have to do id turn on the computer and then you have an intent link to them. Chat rooms also help you meet other people your age from the next town over on enywhere in the country. They @MONTH1 even became your new best friend. When you write a paper do you want to have to write it once then go back and write it @NUM1 more times? Theres a much simpler way it's called a computer. You can write your first draft then all you have to do inordre to get a final copy is reread it and make changes when they are nessecary. Computers also help kids spell better. All they have to do is hit a button.",9
399,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 a computer is a benefit. They help us in so many ways. It is very helpful, it could make someone's life easier to handle. You could keep in touch with old friends or family. It would be easier for work, and when you're bored, you could play some fun games. It's very hard to have family you can't see and keep in touch with! With a computer you could send messages and photo's to interact with them. You wouldn't have to worry about ever losing communication with them. You could also meet new people. Get new friends from anywhere in the world! Have friends from all different race and culture. Computer's are a great way to interact with others, whether its family or friends. It's always had to do work when you have no clue what it's about! if your ever @CAPS3 trouble on something you could always look up information about it. You could learn how to do things or learn more information about a certain item. When you have homework and don't know the meaning of a word, you could always look up the definition of it. They also hold your information. For example, instead of @CAPS3 a ton of papers you could simple just save it in your computer. Then you could print it out whenever you need it. Computers make work easier and help you organise better. Computer's also amuse you as well. When you have nothing to do, you could play alot of fun game's. You could also watch music video's or funny videos to get you laughing. They have practicly anything you want to play. You would hardly ever get bored! As you see, computer's are a benefit to people. It's always helpful when you could keep in touch with anyone, have help with your work, or simply keep yourself entertained. Without computers life would be harder and boring!",8
400,"Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",8
401,"I think computer have shaped @LOCATION1 to what it is today. Computer help people learn, give people a passtime, and all of that can be managed in a certain space of time so you still have time to go outside. Computers help everyone learn. It makes things easier by typing up essays because you could type it faster and its eaiser to make changes. Also, its cheaper to buy a computer and go on the internet and look up foreign countries then acually going there. Another example, is that a computer teachees you hand-eye coordination from typing and using the mouse. Finally, computers can teach you life lessons by reading articles another person wrote. Computers give bored people passtimes. One example, is that you can play computer games during rainy days or when you can't go outside. Also, you can talk to friends through facebook or aim. Another example, is that you can talk to distant family in another country by using programs such as skype. Finally, you can order stuff online instead of wasting gas and going to the store and the things you might order you can play with outside. A lot of people say computers keep kids inside don't know that their are ways to prevent this. One example is you can use shut-off timers that keep anyone from going onto the computer for to long. Also, many people learn how to manage their time on the computer. Another example, is that parents can make rules that their children aren't allowed to play games on the computer on certain days and/or times. Finally, you can keep the computers in the family room so that children don't play with it all night in their room. Those are just some of the many reasons why computer help @CAPS1. They help us learn, pass the time, and it can all be manage during a certain amount of time. Now reading this I hope you believe that computers benefit society.",8
402,"Dear @CAPS1, I thick this is a good idea because you can play games and talk to family or frends and lisen to music. My first reason is playing games. When you are bored and theres nothing to do all you can do is go on the computer and play all kinds of games like cars, shoting, arcade games to. You can do all this if you are bored or if you just want to go on the computer. My seacond reason is talking to freinds or famiely. If your brother or sister or any of your family members live in a different state and you want to talk to them or see them then all you got to do is ask them ""@CAPS2 is your email address and then if they got a myspace or facebook then you could talk to them as long as you want. You can also talk to your friends on those websites to. My thied reason is lisening to music. You can also lison music on your computer bu going to @CAPS3 or downloading frostwire or something like that. You can lison to all kinds of music like hip-hop, rap rock, or havey rock. If you want to lison to any song your going to need the song's name and something the artistes name to. This @CAPS2 I thinck they should put and @CAPS2 they should pick.",7
403,"Dear local Newspaper, I think computer technogily is good. I think there are mang good effects on computers. I think the computer teaches us to work onlone with no ones help. Another good effect on the computer is we can talk to friends online. Also another thing is it gives us the ability to learn about it and surf the web. Another reason is it gives us hand cordanation. All of those are the reasons why I think the computer has good effects. My first topic, why I think there are good effects on the computer is we can do work by ourselves with no ones help. My first reason why I think that is because after looking up links on it and getting use to that homework would be eaiser. Also it will help you get more information on homework and you can get a better grade. Another reason is that you will be able to work onlone you will be able to get it done faster by going on the web. My second topic why there good effects is that you can go online and talk to freinds. My first reason why I think that because if you don't have a cell phone and you wanna talk to friends you can go online. Another reason is that is good is that if you can't do somthing and our in a bind you can tell the person that you can't. Also another reason it is good because you can talk to relatives you havent seen. My last two topics are that it gives good hand cordination and we can learn to surf the web. It gives us good hand cornation because we learn how to use our hands and fingers faster. Also it gets us away from typeing. You can learn to surf the web because after a while you will know were everything is and be a web master. Lastly you will be able to find everything you look for. In conculsion these are good effects. The computer teaches us how to type, and search on the web and learn about it. As you can see these are the reasons I think it has good effect.",8
404,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers do have a positive effect on people. They give you the ability to talk to people online not just your friends but also family that live far away, they also allow you to do any kind of work that can't be done by hand and even allow people to learn about far away places and people. First of all, computers have a positive effect on people. They give you the ability to talk to people online not just your friends but also families that live far away. For example half of my family live in @LOCATION1 and my mom uses internet to communicate with them. Secondly, computers have a positive effect on people. They allow you to do homework that cant be done by hand. Such as essays that have to be typed and can't be hand written, and projects for school. Lastly, computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow people to learn about far away places and people. For example, when I first came into this country, I didn't know much about it, so I did some research and learn great things about it. In conclusion, computers have an effect on people. They give you the ability to talk to people online not just your friends but also families that live far away, they also allow you to do any kind of work that can't be done by hand, and even allow people to learn about faraway places and people",8
405,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am here to prosoade you to agree with me on, that the use of computers does benift society. Some reasons why I think this are school work and business stuff. Also the over all reasearch on important things. My first reason why I think that computer use is benifiting society is because @CAPS6 is oftenly used for school work. In example use @CAPS6 for projects. Also some type of reasearch they might be interested in. But one of the most important reasons why computers use is so high is because, there are a lot of people taking online classes. Wheather its for college or for the sake of your own learning. This is why I think school work shoud be a valid reason for benifiting society. My second reason why I think @CAPS6 benifits our society is the business or job part of the computer. Many people, @CAPS7 a days work at home, they have their own office. They all most create their own company. Another reason is many people also use ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" or publisher. @PERCENT1 of the people who work at public businesses do this, going along with ads, when could also or another reason for this. But then again, you could @CAPS7 pay your bills on line! I remember when I helped my mother pay on of the bills online, and let me tell you, ""@CAPS6 was easy!"". My mother said she do @CAPS6 more often @CAPS7 that she knows how to use @CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 the business side should be more then enough, for me to convince you. My last reason is over all reasearch on all important things. Some of these important things are: online catalogs, the news and another one the most important things of all job openings. I know my self, and I love to shop! So instead of leaving the house, I just go on the online catalog to my favorite store called ""@CAPS8"". The main reasons why I go online is b/c they have more variety and sizes. @CAPS7 for the news, thats all for my parents b/c i don't watch the news. Lastly, job openings @CAPS7 that I am @NUM1, I would like to find a job, even if its mimumum wage. @CAPS6's still something, right? This should be a high priced reason for agreement! In @CAPS9, I think my @NUM2 reason are very well clear; school work, business, and over all reasearch. If these reasons don't convince you I dont know what will!?",10
406,"Dear local newspaper, Computers are effecting more and more people in the society instead of helping. A boy named, @PERSON1 started to have many health problems afer he had bought a computer. The computer that he thought uses helping him wasn’t any help at all. His health issues started to get worse. He soon started to be out of breath more always have a high blood pressure and he started to become overweight. Since he had this computer he didn't exercise or got out to spend time with his family and friends as much as he was on the internet. Computers aren't helpful, my opinion is that all they is waste time, lose your education and can make you unhealthy. As you @MONTH1 already know computer can do a lot to help you but there are some things that you don't know about computers. According to a health magazine, tests shows that using a computer for two or three hours can make you lose @PERCENT1of your brain cells. That's a lot of brain cells to lose when you are going to need them for your education. There is no way to get those back, either. After walking around the streets to listen to what people think about how computers can effect people, @PERSON2, a policeman at the police department had this to say, ""I love using computer and going on the internet, but most of the time I act on he computer at @TIME1 and find myself getting off at @NUM1 @ORGANIZATION1 can be very unsafe and unhealty. Computers can help you find what your looking for or show thigs that you have never seen before, but it is all a waste of line. Instead of going on the computer to go on facebook, youtube, or myspace you should go outside and interact with your family and friends after interviewing @PERSON3 the best female rapper so far she had this to stay ""Computers are okay but they are sometimes just a waste of time. Instead of being on the internet doing something pointless like playing a game you could be stucking far an upcoming test or doing your homework so that you wouldn't be doing it at the last minute"".",8
407,"Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe this because we can talk to people in different countries in a quarter of a second, we can send e-mails to other people, and finally we can go to @LOCATION1, ask @CAPS1 question and get an instant reply. First, we can talk to people in different countries. Did you ever have a relative go on vacation in a foreigh country and have no way of calling them to see if everything is okay? Lets say for instance that they brought their laptops but for at their cellphones. Then, the only way we can contact them is by e-mail. Even if your just happens in you can keep in touch through email. You can even a computer so you can video chat, and not have to wait to get your reply. Next, we can send e-mails to other people. Have you ever set somebody a letter by mail and had to wait two to three days for a reply? Sometimes, your letter is even lost, and these is no way of finding out. Well with e-mail, the wait time of your reply depends on how fast the person whom you are talking to types and most people I know can type a reply in @NUM1 to @NUM2 seconds. I believe that is a from two to three cars. With e-mail those is an eghty three percent chance that your email will not be lost. If for some reason it is lost, there will be a message sent to you telling you that your message was lost and that you need to sent a new message. But most likely chances are that your message wil reach its destination. can go to @LOCATION1, ask @CAPS1 question and get an instant reply. Were you ever wondering about something and the answer was on the tip of your tongue but you just cant think of it? If so you probably would be smart to go to @LOCATION1. You can ask @CAPS1 question and get an instant reply. And I mean @CAPS1 question you can ask questions from wat the price of is in @LOCATION2, to what an is. If you wanted to you could ask math questions as well, such as what is the square root of pi, and what is @NUM3. From @LOCATION1 to myspace the internet is full of information that can have a positive effect on people. This is why I think that the has a positive effect on people, we can talk to people different countries we can send e-mails, and we can ask all sorts of questions.",10
408,"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are a great thing to have. For instance they are entertaining, they have communication, and they help make designs. My first reason is that computer are entertaning. I hate to go look at nature. But I love to play videogames on my computer. I still get my exercise though, because I go out and play basketball then play on my computer. The computers are still a good thing though because after @CAPS1 done with basketball, hanging out with friends, or if its raining I like to play some good old gun blasting computer games. My second reason is that you can comunicate with computers. I love to talk to my friends on facebook. You can just login and talk to anyone in the world. There is also video chat you can actually see someone who is talking to you from anywere. Plus email is great for work. You can send information from one computers to the other. My last reason is for designs every modern car that you drive, is originally from a computer. People get on these computers and make blue print designs to make cars. These are my reasons that computers are good.",7
409,"Dear @CAPS1, I have same questions for you and I was hoping you could answer them. I was wandering. Do you have any computers in your house, if so how many? Also, do you like using the computer? I am trying to figure out how many people don't use computers because. I want to ask them how do they survive without one!? Computers are essential to our present day lives. Everything in the world is in one computer. You can talk, email, even see people through a computer because now adays everyone has a videcam hooked onto their computer. I want to tell you all of the great things computers do not make our lives so much easier. People are always looking for a way to get in touch with someone like if your phone is dead, how are you going to tell your friend what time your going to meet at that place? You can easily just text her from the computer. You can either use your screen-name to text someone or just go on verizon, at&t, sprine... etc.com and text people from there. It would save you from standing your friend up and feeling guilty about it. Has there ever been a time where you needed number, but you couldn't find your telephone book? It sure has happened to me, but you know what I do? I go on the computer and go on yellow pages.com and just look up the restraunt/place on the website. It's as simple as that. You can look up almost anything on the computer, prices, places, facts, anything! Most of the time the true facts will always be there. Computers help you a lot if you need help on histicoral, scientific, and @CAPS2 facts. Computers help us everyday. People need them for communication, telephone numbers, or facts about anything. Most of someones life can be saved to the computer. If you have bad handwriting, then you could just type up your paper and hand it in all nice and neat. Like I said before computers are esstential to our present day lives @CAPS3 reading this, I bet you'll agree.",8
410,"Dear Newspaper, I know the debate on wether computers benifit soscity is greatly debated but to me the answer is odvious. The internet is an extreamly useful invention, used in all schools and is only inconvient when misused. I'm not saying that its @PERCENT1 nessary for every house to contain one, but that its a luxay most people have. The computer and internet combination is probally one of the most genis ideas ever thought up. It is basically any information in a click. Websights such as myspace and facebook allow you to connect and reconnect with friends old and new. Also the ability to create your own web page is greatly useful when trying to promote a bisnuess or company. Not only that but the internet also makes it possible to purchace clothes online without having to go to the store. I know thats useful for those parents, like many that hate driving to the mall. Second, I can garentuee you that almost every school in the country has a working computer with accessable internet. The computer was just one huge leap forward for eduication. These are many websights with a eduicationly purpose only. These are websights like this for children and adults of any age. Many teachers now adays are assinging homework where the internet is nessary. Also tests such as the blue ribbon test are taken online. I can tell you right now that mant teachers would be torn apart without the compluter. Lastly, one of the most important issues. The downsides of the internet. Even though myspace and facebook are ment for good they also have a dark side.",8
411,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am writing to tell you about the effects computers have on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, lets people search @CAPS1 places, talk online with people like family and friends. First, the computers teach hand eye coordination it helps you become a better speller and type fast or type without looking at the keys I know it helped me and im sure it will help you too. Secondly, computers lets you interact with family and friends and lets you make friends like myspace you talk to your friends and make @CAPS1 ones facebook is more mature if you ask me twitter also its just away for you too talk to your friends yahoo, gmail, aol. Even teacher es lets the teachers communicate with parents so it helps you communicate without everyone being in your conversation on the phone. Next, it helps you search @CAPS1 and old places like landmarks or bussnesses like salons, nail palors. Gyms and @CAPS1 resturant you can even search when a movie is goin to come out. A computer can help you very much in this type of case. In conculsion computers are good they help you inform you and they can teach you I love my computer it helps me with homework and helps me study. Say you cant talk with someone over the phone, you can email or chat with them and it's so cool/fun and it interesting how you can learn @CAPS1 things it lets you upload pictures, music videos and you can type essays. The computer is very educational.",7
412,"Dear readers, I think that its good and bad to use the computer to much",2
413,"Dear local newspaper, I think the effects of computers are good. Some reasons I think this is that we get a lot of knowledge from it, contact people you don’t live near and haven't seen in a while. My first reason why I think the effects of computers are good because you can get a lot of knowledge from it. One example would be if you want to make a @CAPS1 meal, you wouldn't find it in an ordinary @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 you would have to look up on the internet for the recipe. Another example is if you wanted to travel to @LOCATION1 by car and you didn't have a map how would you get the directions? You would go on the computer, look up directions to @LOCATION1 and print it out. You would have never been able to go to @LOCATION1 if you didn't have a map or a computer. My second reason why I think the effects of computers is good is because you can contact friends or family that you have not seen in a while. One example would be if your sister just graduated from college and you wanted to congratulate her but you were @NUM1 feet in the air by a airplane and all you had was your laptop and your luggage, you would e-mail her saying good job. These are just a few reasons why I think the effects of computers is good, and I hope the local newspaper agrees too.",8
414,"Currently, there has been a debate on whether or not computers benefit society. Some people, say that computers enable internet conversations between friends, and computers pass off information about faraway places and people. However, I tend to believe that the computer is not necessary. People exploit most of their time on comptuers, reducing their exercise time. Not many pay attention to nature, and instead of talking to friends in the internet, why not meet them at the park? Many people who use their computers reducing their metabolism. This is one reason why the @LOCATION1.A has the highest obesity rates in the world. In addition, the less you exercise, the less healthy you will be, and the more pair you'll recieve, you will feel more tense if your muscles are not exercise. If we, as @CAPS1, continue to lack exercise, there won't be many possibilities for us in the future. Isn't it difficult to know that people pay too much attention to the computer when there are endangered species in nature? Pandas! polar bears, whales of different types, and other creatures all need our help to fight this extinction problem. Unfortunately, we pay much of our attention on the computer, with consideration, as humans, we make things possible, so we should help creatures in need to survive for generations. Perhaps we @MONTH1 learn more about these creatures if we take time off of the computer to do so. Perhaps we will find nature more interesting. Why do we have text messaging in our computers if we have the ability to talk to our frinds in a park? We have the freedom of speech in the @LOCATION1. Our families need help occasionally, but sometime we're not available. While reducing our social life, our computer hours are becoming more important, and are distracting what's mos important. In conclusion, computers hours, you must think about what can be done for nature, for your health, and for your family and friends.",9
415,"Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 I can see both sides of your argument, on wether computers are important. However, computers have revelotivizied they way we live our lives. Just for a moment, think what would the world be like without computers. I feel the computers one or important aspect of our lives. Computers are espicially important to students and teachers. For instance if a student needed to do a report on @LOCATION1, he could look up facts and other things on @LOCATION1, then he could condence the facts into a paragraph on a word document, and if he had a question he could email his teachers. Finaly he, could print out the finished report. All that, without having to get up and bother his parrents to go to the bookstore and pay @NUM1 on a book that he will probably read one time. Also if he had a question there would be no comunication outside of school. Anothe example of students using computers is online textbooks, which spares them of logging heavy texbooks home. Because I know computers have helped me in school and more work much easier. Secondly, @PERCENT1 of busnesses say that they use computer daily, and some agree that without computer, their busnesses would fail. Computer make busnes much easier, espically with the busness monoging and file keeping programs that are oidible. On a computer, busnesses can store customer information, comppare income, and keep stock of inventary without having a cluttered pile or file cobinet. Computers can also saave buseness money because that con cut out jobs such as record keeper. Also busnesses con save time of having meeting via web cams instead of having people drive from state to state for one meeting then do it next monet and the month after; and they coud emall impertant things such as sales projections and other things as well. Computers are also important and helpful in the home. People can do grocery shopping from the home they can order pizza online and they can go shopping online. Also, people can pay their bills online which saves paper. Lets say this, a moter, has a child! who is sick and she wants to know the to heal him, what to feel him, and what medicine to give hime. She can look all this up on the computer and bookmail the websites for next time. Then her other child comes provide, and she wants to find a health snork. She can feed him which she ca do online. Next she ways to make chicken fried rice,out she wnet know how, she can look up the recipe online. Finaly after dinner she need to cleen a stain on the carpet but it wont come out so she buys a carpet cleener from the web. Computers have just moderthy mothers day so much easier. Without computers our lives would be much harder. If we didnt have computers if the person who a report on @LOCATION1 would have failed, the sick child would have not, the hungry child would have been fed unhealthy food, and @MONTH1 would fail. coputers are an important afect of our lives.",9
416,"Dear Newspaper, Have you ever stopped to think what modern day technology brought us? A great example is computers. Many people use this device to book vacation, talk and build relationship people and to discover new ideas the world have to make the disagree strongly. The hot sun glaring down at you just is killing you not to book a vacation to a tropical island! Many people go on vacation and what brought them here has when they sat and places. the computer looking at hotels and booking thou, This modern day technology has brought many humans to places they wanted to go. Over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1's have a chat account to talk with family and friends. The country of europe to the @LOCATION1 is over @NUM1 miles and every time you make a call it can lead to alot of big kills. Modern technology has outsmost the phones and is now using the computer to talk to far away friends and family. In the progress the computer has put over @NUM2 of single people and expressing the relationship. Many arguments have been lead to because of the disagreement. Many critic and saying not many people interact with family and friends. On the other hand the computer has that many people are connecting and communicating @CAPS2 they can set a plan to @CAPS3 many critics have people and spends the computer. Although this is true there should desicions that will improve the health of the human by limiting usage of them. Setting standards on computers can improve this problems and help exercising. In this case I strongly disagree with the critics and for my side of good uses. If they took them away not only will people files fall but everyone will be disorganized in the bong run. Lastly discovering places and websites teaches even the smartes guy or girl something new. After reading this if have proven that my @CAPS4 should be admired by many people.",9
417,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 much do computers affect our life? I have always thought of that question. Technology is getting up to the roof and it makes our life more easier, but have you ever thought that maybe technology might take people's work? In everyday of our live we see something new that comes out and becomes an easy tool for us. But what about us? Since technology come out people has become not the same; for example cars, by having them people doesn't walk and not even exersice, they don't spend too much time with their family and friends and lastly people miss thousands of wonderful things that happend outside. I just think that technology like computers take a whole quater of our life by mostly doing the work for us. First, have you ever, notice that people get obiese so fast? I know the answer to that question. The obesitity in @LOCATION1 is getting worst, people are getting fattier by just been in a cautch and sitting with a computer and eating, what exersise are they doing there? People doesn't exersise anymore, instead of them playing games like, soccer, volley-ball, baseball or even running, @CAPS3!! They are at the computer playing games that doesn't do anything good. I have asked people about what they think about this and this is what a woman answer, "" I htink that people doesn't think about their health, they just think to make life easier"". I agree with her; obisitty could bring you to the hospital and you don't want that. Second, have you ever asked your self about @CAPS2 much time you ever spend with friends and family? Well think of that. Maybe you got a computer because you were spending too much time outside bu not with your family, but you can see that you're probably most of the time at home since you bought your computer, but not with your family. Spending time with your family is so important because you might miss so many wonderful things. For example family parties, or just watching a show on the t.v. I just think that spending time with your family is important. Lastly, if you are a parent and you are too much in a computer, won't you feel bad if something happend with your son/daughter? In everyway we always miss wonderful things, and sometimes we loose it because of technology, you don't want that right? Imagen you are at the computer and your daughter said her first word won't you feel bad if you missed that? I would. Always give time to life because maybe one day you might hate your self for missing so many wonderful things. In conclusion, so many people have become addicted to computers, they just can't lieve it alone. Imagen that you become one of them. You becoming obise, not spending time with family and missing wonderful things that the world provides us. I hope you understand that technology is not everything in life.",9
418,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 of late there has been controversy of how Computers affect people's lives. I believe that the effects on people negative. My main reasons of this argument are. The persons health their the users well being. Did you know that over @PERCENT1 of kids and teens are obese @NUM1 computers can contribute to this statistic. If a person is eating unhealthy but sizing. They can still be fit but if they go on the computer instead of working off all the. They become fat. This can be a serious problem. Becoming overweight has many health risks liked heart other. It also could prevent a person from excersicing. If they are overweight their legs could ache and a simple set of stairs could become a huge challenge. Do you want in obesity rates? I would think not. If you watch tv you could picture perfect families. We all know that no family is like that. Introducing computers could mess up that fact even more. For example, my cousin used to be an outgoing friend person. Now because of computers he is a @LOCATION1 who does nothing else but play on the computer. He gets up eats breakfast. (The of about ), then plays on the computer untill lunch. He eats a small lunch and right back to playing. After along @NUM2 to @NUM3 more hows of playing. He off the computer, hopps into goes on his laptop all night. This greatly affects his family. They try to get him off but all he does is online. He cant interact with his family and this has a huge infact on it. Even though he could get off and talk one of the only ways of talking to him are through facebook. Now because of this family is. We can easily avoid this by telling every body these known facts. My final argument for you is the users well being teen many of us have a facebook of @CAPS3 I have homework I to use the internet for facts and stories. @CAPS3 I do so to go on facebook. If anyone dows the effect our grades. If we chat on facebook we doing our. If arent doing our homework we wont get a good grade. If we could less to other serious problems. Another thing is that you could actually need your computer to stay. It could be addicting and you might rely on it ""once a to kill himself because he dident have his computer"". So @CAPS2 you can see there many negative effects on a user of a computer. It could many problems inthe future like health. the family happiness. So spread the word for the sake of thousands of people.",10

If you had a computer everything would be easy but @CAPS2 nor. @NUM1 reasons why is if you have kids and they go on your computer you have at home @CAPS11 @CAPS3 cause them addiction, @CAPS11 @CAPS3 be inaproprite, and @CAPS11 could be exspensive. Pleases near my reasons and give me a fighting chance. The first reason why computers are bad because @CAPS11 @CAPS3 cause addition to your child. @CAPS12 a problem because your child bother you and say, ""@CAPS1 or @CAPS7 @CAPS3 I go on the computer pleace"". And you say yes and when you let thom on they will be happy when you say.

There you will but at the age of @NUM2 to @NUM3 years old and you they of inaproprate a computer @CAPS3 do. @CAPS9 last but not least the last reasons why a computer is bad because they are computers cost about @MONEY1 more a days and you @CAPS3 broth your computer and @CAPS11 will cost you a lot get @CAPS11 fixed or to get a new one and they will be on @CAPS11 even more or they @CAPS3 press @CAPS11 up trust me I know. @CAPS5 @CAPS12 why a computer isnt always a good thing.

All the facts are true ans I say about @NUM4 people in the world go threw computers every year @CAPS5 think hard. Do you",8
420,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe many people spend to much time on computers. It is okay to be on a computer for twenty minutes, to a half an hour. But one hour or more, is too long. People could get sucked in by playing adicting games. Also by online chatting survices like facebook, myspace, instant messaging, and more. Another way, I think someone could spend more time on a computer is working on a report. They might start it lost minute. These are just same of the many ways someone could be sucked into their computers. Have you ever hopped on the computer and played a game? Then you look at the time and its an hour later? Games are very adicting. you can play a game for hours and not notice how much time has passed by. Games are very fun, but they fry your brain. @PERCENT1 of the human population spends up to an average of two hours on a computer each day. I think, we should eliminate some games off the internent, so people can spend days exercising and hanging out with friends, not playing silly games. Have you ever started a conversation with someone and realized you have been talking for an hour and a half? And that you have homework? @PERCENT3 of teenages on average spend three hours each day chatting with friends on the internent. Facebook, myspace, instant messaging are all examples of this. It is okay for someone to talk to their friends, but you need to watch the time so you do not get carryied away. I think, we shoud cut down out use on these websites, so children and teenagers can get their homework done. Have you ever been assigned a report and wait till the last minute to get it started? Many teenagers do this. They wait and start their reports the day before their reports are due. They then, are stuck on the internent for hours trying to get it done. Which makes their grade lower then if they were to start it earlyier. @PERCENT2 of students wait till last minute to do their reports, on average, they spend over four hours on the computer. I think we should make sure that students start their report earlyier so it could bring up their grades. In conclusion i believe people have spent way to much time using computers, due to games, internent chatting, and reports being done last minute. I think if we elimate games off the internent, cut down use on internent chatting, and start reports earlyier, people will start exercising, hanging out with friends and family, get homework done and get higher grades.",9
421,"The computer is able to do so many things. It think computers have posotive effects on people. But some experts believe they don’t which is why I'm writing this paper so that I can explain the positions from both sides. Did you know most everyone who his a house their chances of having a computer is just as lucky as having a telephone. Computers believe it they help us in life wether @CAPS1 to keep information, talk online, find a good recipe or what ever it is @CAPS1 there. That is why computers are so positive. It we did not have computers there would not be any technological advances that we have @DATE1, @CAPS1 one of the most important devices. Let me share my expierence okay. I had a job interview right well I could not find that street so I went on my computer and it gave me the directions I made it to my interview. Thats why I think computers have posotive effects. Now the opposite side says people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with fiends and family. Well I have some people spend to much time on their computer @CAPS1 completely choice. And those are people who usually don't have alot of self control. And exercising who said that everyone need exercise in the persons already skinny what does need to exercise. For the interacting with friends and family you can do that I mean how long can a person look at a computer screen. So in conclusion you can see that computers are good but with self control they can be enjoyed with no bad side effects. So next time on the computer enjoy it but remember your friends, family and your health is more important.",8
422,"Can you imagine a world full of lifeless zombies obsessing over technology such as computers, television, and cellular phones? Our world as we know it will come to an abrubt end if we don't stop this nonsense. Computers can cause obesity, a lack of interactment, and they waste their time on these useless items. Our world can't set aside time for such. Our planet is run by us humans and if we don't take care for its necessities, we will all die including our beloved planet @LOCATION1. Computers aren't a benefit to our society today. First off, computers can cause major obesity like it has done already. Obesity is one of the most brought up health problems in the world. Many issues cause obesity but technology (computers) take a big role in it. Instead of sitting on a computer all day, they can do something a lot more productive such as taking a walk starting a club (adult once children!), help out neighbors ect. So what if they teach hand eye cordination they don't teach us how to stay fit! Computers play a big role in the obesity factor. As adults, you should know how much obesity matters. Children are the future nobody would want the future leaders to be known for the widespread obesity. Never theless, computers take away ""bonding"" time from family and friends. Adults and children alike are lacking social needs. They don't verbally and physically interact ith their ""online friends"". And they wonder why families these days are turning out the way they are the source of the cause is computers. Anyways, people spend too much time on computers if people didn't waste so much time on computers they wouldn't be losing jobs like dropping flies. The unemployment rate is high because they suppose they ""don't have enough time"". When all their time is devoted to To computers if they took out the computers in their lives, they would have @CAPS1 of time to do such. No one wants a ""stay at home"" unemployed loser as themselves. In the end, computers are not a benefit to our poorly run society. They cause obesity, corrupt social needs and eat the people's time away, you @MONTH1 think computers allow others to ""chat"" online with their ""online friends"" but they don't provide our physical and verbal social needs which results in a low self esteem. If newspapers keep publishing articles about the ""benefits of computers."" people will soon stop believing that non sense and eventually stop purchasing these newspapers. Nobody wants to read lies, do they?",9
423,"Computers? Have you ever thought of how a computer is made or how every small part of a computer is installed? Well, unfortunately I don't have the answers to these questions but I do have another quistion for you to think about. Are computer's bad for you? Well, I think that they arn't because first of all, they teach us hand-eye coordination, give people the chance to learn about places and people that they have never seen or even heard of, and lastly the allow people to talk to faraway relatives or friends without ever having to go to them. As I was say in before, the computer gives people good eye-coordination. For example people usually are not very good catching a ball at first but of course if you keep on practicing you will get better. Same thing with the computer, at first you arnt very good or fast at typing but if you keep practicing you will gradually get quicker at it. Then this good habit will help you while your at school or at work. Second the computer gives people the ability to learn about places or people that they have never seen or heard about. For example some people might have yet not heard the warter falls, trails, or food's from @ORGANIZATION1. Another example is that mabey some people might not know about the belly dance came from @LOCATION1. or the big dragon came from @LOCATION2. The excelant source to find out all these things in a quick amount of time without having to . The computer is also excellent for elderly people are in weel chairs and can't take too much . Lastly, it let's people talk to far away relatives or family members online. This is better because then mabey a father went on a busines trip to another country and talking on the phone is really satisfying also you can forget about sending letters. It is always nice to greet a father, a mother, or even distant cousin online were you can see how much they have grown. I hope you you have taken my side on this judgement for it is very important to me. Please remember my three reasons and don't forget that this includes you to.",8
424,"Dear @CAPS1, Some people say that computers are fun, smart, and do no harm. Is that true though? Do computers make harm? Well, for one thing, I know that computers can take up! a lot of peoples time. For example, many people don't go outside as much. This is because most people are usually on their computers. What are they doing on the computer you ask; well lets, find out. There are many things a person can do on a computer. It can be fun chatting, educational or hard working. A lot of people use a computer for fun. For example, many people use the computer to chat with their friends. There are many sites to chat with friends. That can usually take up a lot of peoples time. A lot people can talk for hours on the computer and that is what takes up their time instead of going outside. Another example is the games that people are playing.To me, the computer games are one of the biggest problems. This is because a lot of the games can be to much fun, that it can be find a game and play it all the time. This can not only take up their time outside, but it can ruin their life. The game can be so addictive that kids and adults might not get their work done. That can cause failure in school or getting fired at work. On the other side though, a lot of people use a computer for work and school. Beside internet chating and computer games, many people use computers for school and at work. People type their work up or they send work to their e-mail to bring home. This is a good thing about computers, but also a bad thing. It is a good thing because now people can get their work done faster. This is a bad thing because it is another reason to stay inside.For work, people depend on computers. They save work on their and they use computers to build things. For exemple, people use a computer to program a robot. Although they use computers for a good reason people should make time for outside. A lot of people need to take breaks off the computer: because computers can do harm. This is because if they spend all their time on the computer they can get sick. Going outside, exercizing and getting fresh air is very important. So people out there, get off your computer. Stop chatting, pause your game, take a break from your work, and go outside. Enjoy the nature. Most of your day should not be on the computer. Thank you for your time. ",9
425,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you know @PERCENT1 of people today use the computer for necessary reasons? @CAPS5's true! @CAPS5's a fact the computer can help you with keeping in touch with friends, getting the latest news, and even gives you map access. Let me tell you some important facts about the computer. Of course, we all have friends in different cities and/or states! Instead of over charging a phone bill, many people keep in touch via email. Email is high tech, and super easY! All you need is your friends email adress and you can send them anything from a friendly hello, to @CAPS1 pictures of the family. Teens love to chat with friends and they're able to get to know each other better through the computer. Sites such as facebook are certainly popular with this generation of teens. The fun messages are what makes everything so great. Keep in mind all the avaiible ways to get in touch with friends and see why the computer is so great. Everytime I log onto the computer I'm able to see the latest news updates! I remember going on and seeing something pop up about my favorite band breaking up. Thanks to the computer I got to read all about @CAPS5 and I was extremely glad I'd seen that because if I hadn't I wouldn't of got to see their last concert. While I do understand, the computer @MONTH1 not be the healthiest activity, @CAPS5 definaltly is a great news source and everyone reads the news whether @CAPS5 be political, or about celeberties. Knowledge about what's currently happening in our country, and exercise is equally as important therefore, I'd be the first to support the computer as a possitive effect on people today. Have you ever been lost? Maybe you didn't write down the correct directions, or couldn't remember. Next time bok up directions on the computer! @CAPS5's so helpful and could really save you a hastle. There're so many websites that have maps you can print out, such as map quest. @CAPS5's a much easier, clearer way to understand where exactly you need to go. In my opinion @CAPS5 can help so much and @CAPS5 would be the right idea to go cheer @CAPS5 out today. Imagine all the places you could go just by getting a map online! Keep this in mind as one of the many great things about the computer. Now that you know some posotives about the computer, remember how they could benefit you! Being able to chat with friends is one of the best! Don't forget about hearing the latest news, and finally, never get lost again, just print out a map. There's no doubt in my mind the computer has a very possative effect on every one! The time is now to get out there and pick up a computer for yourself!",10
426,"As more and more people are becoming accustomed to using computers, I believe that this is having a negative effect on society. Because of computers people are not exercising as much as they should, which is of crucial importance. In addition, people are becoming unable to envoy and appreciate nature while they still can. Finally, people are slowly being their ability to communicate with family and friends. As every day people are getting in touch with technology they are losing touch with the world around them. Therefore, the advances in technology are having a negative affect on society. When the average, person uses, the computers, be it for business, homework, chatting, or just for fun, they are easily occupied for long periods of time. They consider themselves ""too busy"" for a thing called exercise which is becoming more and more curcial to our health and well-being. With music, walk, cool friends right in front of us, who has live. Time to go for a walk, jog, or bike ride? with computers, people are the will exercise. In this day and age, when is becoming a we need our exercise more. Every day rainforests indicated on the one, polluted, and clouded. We need and because of the realize ever a @ORGANIZATION1 screen. We need to write up and appreciate with the @ORGANIZATION1. As time goes by communication technology through the internet this issue of helping @CAPS1, healthy relationships is becoming a progressively worse issue. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" is something that doesn't completely exist on the internet. This means that while you @MONTH1 find someone you can call a ""friend"" online, you never know exactly who they are until you've actually, met them...which could be potentially dangerous. Additionally, the very @CAPS1 emotions and human need for interaction that comes with relationships is something their can never be simulated or programmed, no matter how ""advanced"" your technology is. As you can see, the dependancy on and average of computers is having a negative affect in our society. We are not taking the time for exercise, and human interacting, all of which are to our health.

427,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever trully marveles at the computers in our generation today? Have you seen all the interesting and amazing things that computers allow us to explore? Computers have been thought to advance our society because of its abiliyt to show websites containing rast and diverse research. However, let me ask you this - have you ever wondered if computers actually ruin the life someonehas? Well, people who use computers are drown into them, and they ignore the necessary physical activities one can get from being outside. Also, people who spend their time infront of a computer screen don't inteact as much with friends and family as they nirmally would. Also, one major threat that teens and children face while on the internet are people who try to talk to them online and could become a dnager to the children. In order to help the wee-being of people, we need to realize the negative effects of computers! If oyu were to talk in the park or even visit a field, you would most likely someone enjoying the outdoorss. When I say that @CAPS1 mean like playing soccer or fotbol, or playing frisbee, @CAPS2 who do this rather than sit inside staring ata computer, help their body stay healthy. When you are on the computer, no healthy activity is involved. Would you rather see yourself healthy and active or lazy and sluggish? Well. when the summertime comes, my friends and I usually go to the feild to play a game of soccer. Also, we sometimes go to the beach and enjoy the cool, freshing water in the pool. Not to mentio, we even find activities to do in the cold, freezing winter such as sledding nad snowboarding. @CAPS2 need tog et out and chair, pry their eyes from the computer screen and go out and smell the fresh air. The feeling of being outside will raise your spirits and sgift you from a person in a trance to a person that feels alive! Also . ahve you ever gone gone home and just retreat to your room for some quite? Then you decide to go on the computer to get away from your troubles. ""@CAPS3 is ready, a family member informs you; however, you don't respond because you enjoy the computer so much. Computers interfer with your connection to family members and friends. In addition, many people sit in a tence like state while at the computer, blocking out any outside communication. Computers do not help families come toigether they separate them. This vcreates and unhealthy family, which is bad because people need to have a strong connection with family. Studies show that the average time a person spends on the computer is five hours! This pretty much takes up a lot of time, so families can't spend time with one another. One important problem that children and teens face are @CAPS2 oover the intenet are people known as ""child predators."" @CAPS4 people usually seek to hurt a child by getting information out of them and meeting them. Research shows that @PERCENT1 of children encounter @CAPS4 ""child predators; would you want to see your child be hurt by @CAPS4 horrible people? Computers are the reason, a with the internet for @CAPS4 accurances. Children and teens need to be protected from this major threat! In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people and thier lives. First, they don't allow people to be active and go outside. ",10
428,"Dear @CAPS1, Advances in computer technology have positively affected the society we live in today. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, help kids learn inside and outside of school, and connect the world socially. These amazing devices have done nothing to harm the new generation. In fact, they have done quite the opposite. Computers are an excellent way of teaching hand-eye coordination. People who are opposed to using computers believe that all they do is make kids lazy and ignorant. This is not the case. The coordination gained from using the mouse games over to sports like baseball and lacross. Players have to look at an incoming ball, and guide their stick or mitt to catch the ball. As you can see, coordination is essential to sports. It is also needed for simple every day tasks around the house. These could be as plain as just taking out the trash or cooking meals. We overlook the fact they easy jobs like these still require coordination. A misplaced pot could pour boiling water on the floor and cause a huge mess. W are lucky that we live in a world with such a good teacher of hand-ey coordination. Computers are the worlds most knowledgeable teachers. No matter how hard you try if you are using a computer, you will learn something. The internet is a best cache of information. In the current day and age, the environment is a growing concern. Paper no made from trees, so must be cut down. It takes forty years for a tree to grow, and seconds to cut one down. Schools everywhere should use computer and keyboards for work instead of paper and pencil. Since most students are familiar with computers, they enjoy working with them more than writing. The average kid could learn more in an hour with a computer than they would whole day at school. The transiton needs to be made. Computers are also a massive social network. Instant messaging and @CAPS2 are now primary sources of communication. If it hasn't for computers, I wouldn't be able to talk to my friend that moved to @LOCATION2 two years ago. This is just one example of how social networks are helpful. They help people stay connected with old friends, and work. All major corporations use computers to invest, sell products, and store information. Computers are the ultimate way communicate. Obviously, computers are growing exponentially in popularity. The @LOCATION1 should put this to use. Imagine a more eco-friendly country where we don't have to cut down a million acres of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 rainforest every year. The benifits of computers are endless. Three of these are hand-eye coordination, knowledge and communication.",9
429,"Many people think that computers are not a good thing. They think people spend to much time on the computer and are getting less exercise. They are also concerned that looking at the screen could be damaging to your eyes. Those statements maybe true. I believe that computers are beneficial. You can talk to people from other places. You could learn about other places in the world. You can also use the computer to research topics. first off, on the computer you can talk to people. Whether it on a webcam or one of those networks to @LOCATION1 and chat with each other. On the computer you can chat and talk with people without having to be on the phone and paying a bill for it. For example, I have family in another country and one way we always talk is on the computer. We talk on webcam and chat. Calling someone from another country on the phone gets really expensive. If I didn't have a computer then I would not have that great of contact with @CAPS2 family from another country. In addition, You can use the computer to look at foreign countries. Many people including @CAPS2 parents have used the computer to look and read into about other countries. @CAPS2 mother, whenever @CAPS1 plans a vacation, looks up the country we are going to and gets more information about it. Like @DATE1 we went to a hot exotic place, @CAPS2 mom looked it up to see what we should pack to go there. If it weren't for the computer we might have packed the wrong items. Lastly, computers are a great source for researching. I can't tell you how many times I have used the computer to research. Books and encyclopedias are great sources but the computer has so much to offer. You have so many links you can go to and sites. You can find pictures, videos, maps, and much more. I have used the computer many times to research, sometimes its a requirement to have a few sites you have gone on to research for your project in school or something. If you have a computer at home you can build up your computer skills for school. Computers are a more positive thing than negative. You can talk to people without the expensive phone bill. You can learn about other places and cultures. Also, you can use it for researching purposes. Computers @CAPS3!",8
430,"Dear Newspaper, I think computer use is good because, it will teach people to have hand-eye coordination. Also people will have the ability to learn about different states and countries. I ask people would be able to interact with their family and friends from different towns. Those are all the reasons why I think computers are a good use. The first reason why I think people should use computers is it will teach people to have hand-eye coordination. People will know how to stay focussed with their eyes and also know how to also use their hands all at the same time. To stay focussed with their eyes people would have to wear glasses for the light. Also so when they are typing they wont have to keep looking down all the time. When people coordinate with their hands on the computer its so they know were the different are thats why computers are good. My second reason why computers are good is because people will have the ability to learn about the different states and countries. They can also see how nice or bad the countries and states look. Also they will be able to read about what different cultures they have and religions. In the states also be to read about @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and how we have a wonderful state. That's why computers are good use. My final reason why the use of computers is good because, people can interact with their family and friends online. There are a lot of different websites you can go to that you can search for one of your family members or friends. You can talk to each other. Also you can talk to them even if their in a different state. You guys can talk about a lot of different things. For example, the family and life and even if you miss them. Thats why computers are good. Those are my reasons why computers are good. Not only can it teach you about hand-eye coordination, family and friends, and about different states. But also you can play a lot of different games and also type on an notepad. Also if your stuck on a math problem you can use the calculator. That's why people should use the computers.",8
431,"Dear the daily newspaper crew, I have seen some of your own disagree about using computers. I for one believe that using a comenter really isn't that bad. For example, the computer is actually good for education. Many use them to create @NUM1 images of things for schoolprojects or science fair projects. I use these machines to play video games on to cure my boredum like most young teens and children do. Unlike most people I dont stay on it forever. I usually play for a couple hours. There are some downsides to having computer in the house. For one the machines use up load of energy in the house making the electric bill rise and @DATE1. On some websites there are people who try to be a stalker like the website my space and twitter but on the bright side these who try to be a stalker usually instantly get caught and put in jail. Computers actually have a positive effect on the mind and movements. For example children who have computers learn how to fly a kite or for themselves with their parents watching and they learn hand-eye. Many children who play sports that have computers actually manage to catch a ball faster than usual. So you see computers are not that bad. So please think of what will happen to children if computers are banned.",7
432,"I believe that people should enjoy nature more than computes. I say this because computers can sometimes get addicting. The people who are addicted will only know about stuf on the internet. people need exersise. They will not get exursise by sitting in front of an computer all day. Computers are addicting. The people who spent most of their time on the computer are the people who are addicted. When they get addicted they will probly fail in school because they do not do their homework. Don't you hate it when you feel week and tierd? Well that is how the people who sit at computers all day feel like alot! @CAPS1 people whant to stay healthy then they should get some exersise daily insted of sitting in front of a computer all day. Alot of people get annoyed when they dont know about stuff when it happens. Most of the people who do that are the people who are mostly on the computers. I say that because the people who are mostly on the computers only know about things when it is on the computer. That is why I strongly believe that people spend to much time on computers rather than. This is because firstly computers get addicting, secondly people need exersise @CAPS1 they want to be and stay healthy lastly @CAPS1 people like to know things the only way they will find out is on the computer",7
433,"People using computers is a good way for them to talk with distant relatives or friends, learn keyboarding skills, and research about far-away places. First, the wonder ful technology that computers have is amazing. They can surf the web in milli-seconds. This benefits people because if you were doing a research paper on china, many search engines let you surf the web at blazing fast speed, and in a little time, you could have all the information you needed. Scientists say that @PERCENT1 of computer-users have fast internet, and they reccommend it to other, first-time buyers. The computer that I use is a unique computer that was customizable to my liking. I like playing games and editing videos, so I got an outstanding graphics car that has outstanding speeds for rendering videos. This let me play games and edit videos, and my @NUM1 gb hard drive is capable of storing all my programs and projects, for future use. Doing many things on the computer can really help your hand-eye coordination. In fact, about @PERCENT2 of computer say that over a using a computer. they were to type @PERCENT3 quicker that they could before. Thats a very good number, but the average person woh types could write in @NUM2 in I have. I can type a that big in about @NUM3 minutes because it have been typing in other @NUM3. Computers are a big part of my life and I still have time to do other things with my family, and friends. The last thing that computers help us people with chatting with friends on websites, like facebook, myspace, and @ORGANIZATION1. They all let you share with all of your friends, and of you needed to, you could chat with far away friends or relatives. This helps because if you haven't talked to your cousin in a while, you can check up with him and talk about things. I have a causing who graduated college and is now teaching in @LOCATION1, and when our gets together, we webchat with him on @ORGANIZATION1 and it is helpful because we haven't seen him in @NUM5 years, and we all wanted to see what he was up to. He was also able to send us pictures, which helped because we all missed his face. So, blazing fast speed to chatting with distant relatives. These are key factors that show us that you can have fun on computers and still have time for family and friends.",10
434,Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think that people are spending to much time on there computers and not exercising as they're supouse to do every day. @CAPS5 @CAPS3 says that @PERCENT1 of all people in the intere world are spending to much time on the @CAPS3 and not enjoying nature. So they don't get exercis like other people do. @CAPS5 @CAPS4 says that people that go out side and not stair at there computers will live a long and helthy life. I say that @PERCENT2 of all people that are always on the @CAPS3 often go blind and will never see who the world is changing awound them. I say that @PERCENT3 of all people that don't always go on the @CAPS3 will live a better life then the people that are always on the @CAPS3. My @CAPS5 told me that you should go on the @CAPS3 just not for a very long time because beeing on the @CAPS3 for a very long time is not so good for you so don't go on the @CAPS3 for a very long time only for a short amount of time and don't go on the @CAPS3 every day only like @NUM1 time a week. People that have @CAPS6 book acounts you shouldn't go on it like every day go on like @NUM1 to @NUM3 time a week because going on the @CAPS3 for a very long time is not good for people. My @CAPS5 @CAPS8 says that @PERCENT4 of all people in the world have @CAPS9 and ofthen go blind because of them using the @CAPS3 all the time and that if you go on it for to long your @CAPS3 will mealt down and brake. I realy think that people shouldn't go on the @CAPS3 for every long time because every time they go on is a time that they will miss in the life so please don't do it.,8
435,"As you can see, technology these days is always getting more and more advanced. It seems as if there is a new invention that atracts many people to buy all the time. One electronic that has been useful in so many ways to people are the computers. Many think to much time is spent on this, but then I think about how much it's benefiting. Computers can tell you pretty much anything you need to know, @CAPS1 it's about same country, or how to solve a problem. @CAPS2, computers are so advanced were you can talk to friends who are faraway. Lastly computers is helping us giving very specific directions, rather than figuring out a map. Say you're doing a school project about a country. By typing in exactly what you need to know you can find your information in a heartbeat. @CAPS1 it's population, density, languages, foods or holidays, computers are the easiest and most simple way to get this information. Or maybe you just want to know about this country because it interested you. Maybe even you plan on visiting this country, you're going to want to know about the place you'll be spending your time. If you do plan on traveling to somewhere you've been researching, you can order your plane tickets right there online. You can figure out the routes you plan on taking, and this can help oprganize your trip. Another reason computers are benefiting so many people, is the feature of communicating with others, @CAPS1 it's taking to a faraway friend or family, or you're bestfriend a couple streets over; you probably still want to keep in touch with them. Computers are so advanced now, that they have webcams; were you can visually see the person your contacting right into the computer. This is a more exciting way to talk to someone, especially if it's someone you don't see often that @MONTH1 even live in another country, @CAPS2, most teenagers like to keep in touch pretty much every day. Usually kids like chatting on instant message just for the pleasure of talking to your friends. Finally, computers are benefiting us with knowing directions and routes. Like mentioned before, computers can give straight foward directions. This is esier to handle rather than useing a map while on the road. There are websites were all you have to do is type in your exact loocation and your exact destination and it will tell you specific roads and turns you need to take. In conclusion, those for who are worried about the ones who should be exercising, being outside, enjoying nature, should learn to expand there time doing so, and shortening time online, and learn to be on the computer, only when necessary.",9
436,"Dear Local Newspaper, I have herd that some people do not agree that computer benefit our society. Well in this letter I am going to give you three reasons how computers do benefit our society. Those reasons are @NUM1) People have friends and family in other states @NUM2) some people use them to stay organized And @NUM3) Computers help you learn more. I hope that by the end of this letter you will see that computers do benefit our society. First of all, I think that computers benefit our society because @CAPS7 lets people @CAPS3 in contract with family and friends in other states. This is true that you could use the phone and call them out you have to pay for long distance. You don't have to pay anything to email somebody. I know from experience because, I have friends and family in a lot of states in the @LOCATION1 ""@CAPS1 computers help me stay in contact with my family all over"" @PERSON3 ( @ORGANIZATION1 ) @CAPS2 many people use the computer the contact with loved ones everyday. Some people even on them to stay in touch with family or at war. Next I believe that computers benefit society because @CAPS7 keeps people organized. I know this many not seem like a big deal but a lot of people or computers to @CAPS3 things organized @CAPS2 they know how everything is would happen if didn't have computers to @CAPS3 all of the appointment in? Well I will tell you what would happen to @CAPS3 all would end appointment would @CAPS3 giving you things you already got. ""I @CAPS3 @CAPS4 on my computers - @PERSON1 And @CAPS5, I strongly belive that computers benefit our society because they help people learn more. Yes @CAPS7 is right that not everybody goes on the computers to learn but that doesn't mean they don't learn. Here's a cuple examples is @NUM1) @CAPS6 - @CAPS7 lets you learn song lyrics, dance moves and more (@NUM2) @CAPS8 - @CAPS7 lets you learn what other people like, don't like and @CAPS2 on. Then there is face book, @CAPS7 lets you see what people are doing that day. ""People learn everything to the computer"" @CAPS9 @PERSON2. Now I hope you see that computers don't benefit our society than that is your opinion. I hope you see what I see now.",9
437,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1. There has been lots of talk and arguments about computers and wether they benefits the society. I belive it does benefit society. One reson is because you can communicate with others. Another reson is theirs many things to do on these computers or even the world wide web. Haveing computers is always handy. You can talk or web chat with friends. This one time online I found my old friend from @LOCATION1, that I havened seen in five years. Whenever I come home from school I'll go on the computer and talk to all my friends. The computers a great place to make plans or to catch up with some buddies. My next reson for why they benifit society is theirs so much to do. It's like an at home amusment park. The internet is a wonderfull thing. either to do home work or play games. even some @ORGANIZATION1 I'll just sit down for two or three hours and just play a game. But, i still exercise daily. yes, computers can get addicting but, its always good to go outside and exersise. Many people say over @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS1. population has a computer, and @PERCENT2 check email or go on the computer every ten minutes. yes its not heathy but its their dissition. In conclution I belive computers are indeed benifical. I have stated many resons why. such as, They are great for communication or @CAPS2 up with some friends, also theirs an infinint amount of things to do. So if you don't have a computer go out and get one. They will be worth your wild.",8
438,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people is they help make every day life easyier. First off, you can chat with people from long distances. Also, it makes home work, and finding information a lot easyier as well. Last but not least when you have nothing else to do, you can play games, and watch videos from online. One of the best things about computers is going online and chatting with @CAPS1 friends. Even if the are across the country, you can still chat with them, for free! Also, if you can't get in touch with them, you can send them a @CAPS2-mail, and as soon as they log on, they will get your message. Best of all, when you forget to write your home work down, you can go online, and ask one of your friend what it was. Besides talking to people, you can do your homework on a computer as well. All you have to do is make a word document, and type with the keys. Let me just say this is a lot better than having to write with a pencil. Not to mention, typing a paper is a lot neater. Also, if you are doing a report on something, all you have to do is look it up on the internet, and you'll get endless information about it, all on your computer! Last but not least, you can play games on your computer. Whenever someone is bored doing nothing they can just turn on a computer, and play their favorite game. Not only is it fun, but it teaches hand-eye coordination as well. Some people say they don't have the money for games, but little do they know, there are millions of free online games, that any age can play. This is great on a boring day when you have nothing else to do. In summary, the effects computers have on people is they help make everyday life easyier. You can chat with people from long distances, and it even makes home work much easyier to complete. Not to mention it has fun games for people to play when there bored, or have nothing to do. I strongly belive that computers have a positive effect on people, because of all the things they offer, and help us on. Thank you.",8
439,"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to you to let you know my opinion on computers and technologies. Computers have now become part of our society and culture and is very important by following reasons. One computers let you surf online anytime you want. Two, computers allow people talk online. First reason why computers are so critical in our culture is that computers let you surf online anywhere and anytime you want. This is very convenient. What if you live far away from the nearest library? When you have to write a research paper? Jane lives @NUM1 miles away from her town library. Her mother could drive her ther, but what if she wasn't at home or driving someone else to a doctor's appointment? This is when computers come in handy. Jane can just simply go online and do the research! Not only that but also, ""www.internetsocool.gov"" states that information you can find in a regular library is about @NUM2 of information you can find online. Secondly, computers let you talk with people both faraway and nearby online and videochat. This is very useful for me. Since I live by myself in @LOCATION1, I miss my family a lot. Although with internet, I can talk to my family whenever I want! Also, you can video chat with your lab partner to discuss how you can make the lab report better! @PERSON1, the author of ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"" also states in his book that over @NUM3 million people use internet to videochat for educational purposes. In conclusion, ivideochat @MONTH1 sound like something to do for lark, but it is actually used for many good purposes. On the other hand, some people say that computers are bad. Some say that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising and spending time their family. Although, ""The @DATE1 survey of what people do,"" states that @PERCENT1 of people who use computers are healthy both physically and emotionally. Just because we use computers to make our life easier, it does not mean that we don't value spending time with family. In conclusion in our culture because are very crucial in our culture because it can let you surf online and help you interact with people who live faraway.",9
440,"Dear local newspaper, I beileve that using computers is a good idea and will help people. So many people all over the world have computers. Computers are good because they help kids learn, communicate with others, and help teach responsibility. Please just listen to what I have to say. First, I beileve that computers help kids learn. If you buy computer games like a cooking game you can learn how to cook. Even if you buy the @PERSON1 you are still learning by taking care of them. There are so many good websites that you can go on like @ORGANIZATION1. People learn through playing new things and why not play with your favorite characters. Also, you can go on google and type in anything you want and it will give you the answer. You use a keyboard for all this so you also learn how to type. If your teacher gives you a homework assingment why not type it so you learn that skill. This is why computers are good for hearg kids learn. Secondly, you can communicate with others from around the word or just your friends. There is a thing called @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2. You use a webcam and talk to anyone you want. There are also websites you can go on too communicate with people from all around the world. It is pretty cool because you don't have to travel there to talk to them. All of this stuff teaches you how people are different and no one person is the same. Peoples language could be different or there personality. So many communicating things make computers even better. Lastly, using computers helps teach responsibility. Kids who use internet know that poeple need privacy and that comes with responsibility because you should know that. If someone dosen't want to be bothered then don't bother them that has to do with privacy. Also, you learn to be nice on computers. If you video chatted you should definitely know to be nice and not be rude. That is how you get kicked off of these things. Another thing is people learn to take care of things a computer is worth a lot of money. Not everyone has one so you should be thankful for what you have. Don't brag, but just know you are privleged for a computer. These things are the reasons computers are good. So if you ever consider getting a computer the answer is yes because computers help kids learn, you can communicate with others, and you learn responsibility. Now you know computers are really good for kids not that bad.",9

443,"Dear Local Newspaper, In my opinion I support the advances in technology. Advances in technology helps us get information on things we need to get information on, we can chat with friends and family online and it can help our reading and hand-eye coordination skills. One of the reasons why I support advances in technology is because computers/phones can help us get information on things we need to get information on. We need to know what is going on around us, all the time. We need to know what is happening and what is happening with other people in our lives. We need to know the weather/traffic conditions if you have children you need to know if the school is open and if you work in places that use computers for information, you need to check if your boss or co-worker sent you anything important that you need to know about. The second reason why I support advances in technology is because we can chat with friends and family online. We can chat with our family and friends on the other side of the world who have computer. Most of us want to know if our family and friends are ok and healthy, even though we can't see them in person. I, for one, knows this is fact because my family and friends touch each other online. Staying communicated with our family and friends keeps our boats strong. The last reason why I support advances in technology is because computers can help us with our reading and hand-eye coordination skills. Computers can help our reading skills because if we don't have time to go to the bookstore to get a book, we can read the book online for free. It can help our hand-eye coordination because it can help our fingers move faster and help us do things faster. I stated all of my reasons why I support advances in technology. Computers can help us get information on things we need to get information on, we can chat with friends / family online and it can help our reading and hand-eye coordination skills.",8
444,"Dear editor, I believe that computers are an important part of modern life and proves itself to be available because everyday. Many times we don't even think about using computers, it just becomes a part of our dayly routine. We use computers everyday in many ways, sometimes to stay intouch with a far away friend learn about and experience faraway places, or @MONTH1 be ever to practice hand eye coordination. Computers are so benifical to our life we might not be able to live without them. Most people have experienced a friend or relitive move, when this happens not all hope is lost because with the use of you run stay in touch. Many computers nowadays have built in webcams which alows you to get more than just an email. With these systems you can actualy get an image of your fried or relative. Even oprah winfrey uses the webcam feature on computers to have people ""skype"" on to her show. In adition to this there are many other ways to stay in touch even if your computer is older and have. These reletively new ""social networking series"" include facebook, twitter, and many more. Every morning when i wake up and on sportscenter i always about what famous are posting or twitter pages. This is just another great use of computers. In this economy not many people are spending thousands of to go to a beach paradise in the but with the use of computers, you can go there virtualy. Computers are great in this aspect because they alow you to learn and experience many expensive things for. For example if you wanted to learn somthing about india, you would dn't have to go to the local library and check out a book, you could just type there are many such as this that give you access information that you could ever need. This prooves also to be valable if you are studing faraway while a paper. The computer is just a great way to get information with out every having to leave your home. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill that many people lack. It alows you to throw a baseball, play videogames, or even drive car. Many computer sceptics believe that you don't benifit from using computers but a recen study done by @LOCATION1 news and report reveals that people who use computers had @PERCENT1 better hand-eye-coordination than computers users. When driving you often need to operate the car, up the radio volume, and pass out goldfish to your kids at the same time, so this could be as where improved hand-eye cordination would be handy. Hand eye coordination is an important and this skill is further developed by the use of computers. In conclusion, computers are benificial both in hand-eye coordination and in communication, as well as in geting information or a topic. Computers are one the most significant ever and are valuble in many many ways.",11
445,"Dear @PERSON1, Computers are necessary and benefit our community. They do a great deal to help make our lives easier. There is not a day that we do not use a computer in some way or another. The benefits of our computers are they connect us, the spread news, and they make every day objects work. Computers connect us in so many difffrent ways. Where would businesses be without computers? Most modern day businesses are run by computers. Owners can now have businesses all over the world. With computers a business in @LOCATION2 or somewhere else in @LOCATION4 can be connected with a building in @LOCATION1. They can have live video chats together. With the help of the computers they are able to contact any branch of their business all over the world. Even smaller businesses use the computer to connect to customers. Now a days we do a lot of online shopping. This is an example of how stores connect to their customers. Stores can show buyers everything they have to offer including store locations. This can help stores get more business by connecting the buyer to the shop. The computer not only connects stores and businesses but also people to people. @PERCENT1 of kids in my school own a computer. With all these computers many social networking sites are born. The most popular right now is @CAPS1. Students can connect to old friends from other places and even other countries. We have a live chat on @CAPS1 or even @CAPS2. @CAPS2 is instant messging which is, well, instant. With a simple click people are connected no matter how far apart they are. Therefore, computers conect people. Computers also broadcast news. Without the computers most of us would not no about world news. This includes the @LOCATION3 earthquake. If we did not have the computers to let us know about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 they would be in alot more trouble. They would not have all of these donations. Also computers even broadcast national news. Almost all newspapers are now online along with on paper too. Anyday now they will be completly online. This will drastically change how we learn about news. It would just be a click away. What would have taken days to get here now takes minutes or maybe even seconds. Science also benefits from computers. Phones now can be personal tws, inernet, and messaging devises. Phones are just a tiny version of a computer. Cars also have computers put into them. The @CAPS3 in our cars are computers; we would be lost without them. Also, in cars there are computers to run just about everything else. So, there is not a day where we do not incounter computers. In conclusion, computers benefit us in so many ways. They conect us deliver news, and are in almost all of our technology. Could you imagine life without computers?",10

I go to my @CAPS5 page and feel the cool keys under my fingertips as I send @CAPS7 to my friend in @LOCATION3. These are only some things I can do on my computer. As you can see I need my computer for many things. I am all for using computers and I think they are a useful resorce. But @CAPS6't stop now, I have many more reasons for using computors. Thier not all that bad. Primarily, if you want to save money on gas, @CAPS6't Use @CAPS7 @CAPS8!! I can't stress @CAPS7 enough to say that if you need to talk to a friend far away @CAPS6't drive and waste gas, or even waste money on long-distance calls. Go to @CAPS5, facebook, twitter, or something that will save you gas and money. Some people want to talk to thier friends in @LOCATION2 but they @CAPS6't have any of these computer sites. Pursuade them too!! Another issue some face is, ""You need to get out and excersize."" I have only one answer. Most people @CAPS6't know the right ways to excersize. Then, they end @CAPS8 hurting themselves. If they just went online and found out that they could do a painless, priceless, fun work out that is very effective then they would not get in so much physical and finantial trouble. Also, others complain that people need to @CAPS10 more out in nature. Well, I say, what if you encounter a wild animal that you know nothing about, or say you were lost for days and didn't know what you could or could not eat? LIke I @CAPS9 say, ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11"" remember @ORGANIZATION1. FInally, if your doing a report or something formal, you want @CAPS7 to look nice, right? Well, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people in the @LOCATION4 have messy handwriting and 9/@NUM3 teachers mistake words that are messily hand-writen. This shows that if you use a computor @CAPS7 will not only show the word you wrote but also correct @CAPS7 with spell check. In conclusion, there are many benefits to using a computor. Lets recap, computors can save money, time, and gas. Computars can provide useful information in the real world. They can also correct spelling mistakes as well as prevent mistakes in legibility. Act now!!! Show others that there are benifits to using computers, show them all the wonders of this amazing machine, That is not only a time waster but a life saver.",10
447,"Lies! The computers we use in society do not harm us in any way! They are a huge step forward for mankind and only benefit our lives. They benefit us greatly for the following reasons: computers are a source of knowledge, computers can aid the advertizment and buissness of many workplaces, and they are a very helpful and easy way to communicate with someone across the street or across the ocean. Without a dabt computers do nothing but benefit the people of our society. First of all, computers are a big source of knowledge. Many people @MONTH1 want answers to a question they have encounterned recently but cannot find the answers in a book or newspaper so they turn to a computer and immediatley their problem is solved. Computers today hold every bit of information on every topic imaginable from history to politics. All one has to do is find a site such as @ORGANIZATION1, type there question, and millions of answers pop up assuring a solution to the problem. Computers can also provide a place to research for a project or statistics of the economy if needed by school, buisness, or just for recreation. Times are changing fast and the sources of the worlds history and school subjects can easily be found in the corner of the internet. What you @MONTH1 have looked for in books and papers can be easily found on internet at the click of a button. Clearly, computers are a huge source of knowledge for our society. Second of all, computers and the internet support many buisnesses in advertising and making profit. Every single time a visit to the internet occurs many different buisnesses are able to advertise their products and overall buisnesses with pop-ups, side bars and websites. It clearly helps the workplace get attention. Along with advertising products buisnesses can even sell their products online without doing a thing. This can also aid the consumer because they would not have to drive all the way down to the store and pick up what they need. All they need to do is select the items they wish to purchase and await for its arrival a few days later. Clearly, the computer and internet can help support the welfare of buisnesses. Finally, the computers we use today are a huge and easy way of communication. Contact with people from another street, town, state, country, can be established by the use of social networking sites such as, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3. You could send a letter with the touch of a button with out having to make a trip down to the post office and await a reply. An instant message, which can be used on any of the sites mentioned can also be achieved. This is where you could write something down in the computer, send it to anyone and receive a reply within seconds. Obviously, computers play a big role in the communication of one to another without a problem. In conclusion, it is clear computers benefit the society greatly without a side effect at all. Computers are a good source of knowledge, an aid to buisness, anda great way of communication. Everyone as agreed to this without hesitation so you should too. Computers are the best things that have ever happened to our society today.",10
448,"I think that computers are because you can have arthridis in your finger, loss of vision, and you also should go out side to get fresh air. It is not good to sit on the computer. Because you can get arthrits in your fingers. There is also a deises called carpel tunnel that when you can really grasp anything anymore. My grandma has arthrites in her fingers but it is not from the computer it from doing dishes all the time. But when she does somthing she complains that her fingers hert. So I think @CAPS2 she is doing dishes I think the key bored will do much more damge and will effect you for the rest of your life. My mon always tolled me that @CAPS2 I sir in front of the @CAPS1 to long I will go blind. Well in a magesen it said that ""@CAPS2 you sit in front of a @CAPS1-computer for to long it will parshel blind you. so @CAPS2 you sit in front of a computer doing face book or somthing whats the differents that will parshel blind you. It is good to go out side somtimes to get fresh air or go for a walk those are someways to stay in shape because @CAPS2 you get obeses then you will die @CAPS2 all you do is sit in front of the computer you need to get exercise every day to stay fit and health that is the way to be in stead of eat junk food and drinking soda. In sure it's ok to go on the computer @CAPS2 you look up other health stuff to do. What im geting at is it is good to go on the computer somtimes but it can be very unhealthy to sit infront of it. @NUM1 you need to be healthe to stay alive and @CAPS2 you sit infront of it all day then the results wouldn't be good. Those are the resons why I think the computer is bad to sit infront of all day.",8
449,"Dear @CAPS1, I - like many other people my age - love to sit in front of a computer and explore it's wonders. But that does not mean that I spend my whole life on it like others. So I can see what too much computer time can do. It has made kids my age more aggressive, have health problems, and care even less about the environment. More and more kids are falling into those traps. Too much computer time can make even the nicest person extremely aggressive. I know from past experience that when you bother people when they are on their obsession, they will snap at you, yell, or even start swearing at you, or maybe get violent. If someone stays up to late on the computer, the next day could mean that they're cranky from the lack of sleep. This aggression @MONTH1 cause others to get aggressive in response, which @MONTH1 lead to a verbal or physical fight, which (hopefully) nobody wants. Another issue too much computer time can cause, @CAPS1, are even more health issues. Staying inside all day will keep people from getting the neccessary amount of vitamin @CAPS3 they need which is a vital nutricious vitamin that comes from the sun itself. Not getting enough vitamin @CAPS3 throughout a person's childhood can result in getting an illness called @CAPS5 later in life, which never truly goes away and hinders people from doing the things they love. Too much computer time also means people aren't getting enough exercise, and with the way we eat now, those two things can add up to making a person obeie. Others who do not want to get the proper amount of exercise or eat right and at the same time do not want to become obeisce, @MONTH1 to anorexia. Neither or these weight problems are very good for you, proving my point about the health issues of too much computer time. The issue I will have you read @CAPS1, is how people will become even less caring of the environment. Some of the big technology companies side-step around environmental protection laws to find cheaper ways to make their products and the thing is, no one cares! No one cares so long as they get their newer and better piece of technology. Everyone will just keep protecting these companies to get what they want to satisfy the craving for more computers. Now, I'm not saying that having any computer time is bad. I'm just trying to prove that too much is bad for you. That with too much computer time, people can become more aggresive, have health issues, and become even less caring of the environment. Therefore I urge you @CAPS1 to write an article in the newspaper about the effects of too much computer time, to make it known to everyone in the city. It might help us make a better future.",10
450,"I think computers are very benefical. There are so many uses! From learning, to games, to videos, and to a tool that is very useful. Without computers we would be like the @CAPS1 (@CAPS2 offense any @CAPS1 people). We would have to wait for a news paper or the news to come on @CAPS4.V. to see becalling news. Let me explain my reasoning in the next few paragraphs. First and foremost, there are lots of things to do. You can play online games, off-line games, surf the web, chat, match videos, and so on and so forth. Without the internet I probably would have lost my interest in @ORGANIZATION1. I now am a member of the online community called www.MOCpages.com I post my creations, look at others creations, and comment, and chat. I use the internet to reasearch for school projects. Right now, I am reasearching @CAPS5 @CAPS6 during the @CAPS7 @CAPS8. Normally I would have to slave over books to find something. Now it is much easier, because keywords are matched. Finally, it is a good fool. Did you know the millitary needs computers to store info, attack, keep record, and to pilot certain planes? I need to use a computer to type up home work, because as you can see, my hand writing isn'@CAPS4 the neatest. Also, I stay in touch with my dad, who works in @ORGANIZATION2. I hope I persuaded you on my position. Remember computers, do lots of things, help us learn, and they are a fantastic tool. Thanks for reading, bye!",8
451,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 waste your time learning at home when thats what schools for? People are concerned that too many people are spending too much time on their computers. They spend less time outdoors, excersising, and enjoying nature! People need more time to interact with their family. People are concerned. They are concerned there is way too much computer time. One time my mom had just bought a new computer and I stayed up all night on the internet. When I woke up the morning I was so tired and I didnt want to go to school. I think you should consider less computer time. The more time people use their computers the less time they are enjoying the outdoors. Insted of talking to you on myspace that they right down the street at the park with them. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in @CAPS2 that use alot of computer time. Interacting is a nice enjoy nature and have fun. Family activities is a nice, fun and enjoyable way to spend your time. You can go to park when its nice outdoor weather, go swimming, play sports, in the wintertime you can possibly go to the movies, go to the mall, have fun with the family dont waste your time on the internet. In conclusion, there is too much computer time and you as the newspaper editor I advise you to make computers more expensive so people can spend their money on something more usefull because there is too much computer time. My mom says that ""more people use there computers, more that they put their feet in their shoes and walk outside!"" @CAPS3 people in @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 think the same. Please consider my opinions the right way. Thank you",8
452,"Dear @PERSON2, Have you ever noticed how different our society is today, even from just ten years ago? That's because of computers. Yes, it is true that computer give us advantages like messaging and information, but they also take away from some of the greater aspects of life: staying fit, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. Without those, life would be horribly unbeneficial. While surfing the web @MONTH1 be fun, it has been proven unhealthy. ""if a person was to spend more than two and a half hours on the computer every @TIME1 for about a month they would see a sudden increase in their gain. And if they kept the behavior up, they could gain up to one third their initial body weight until medical help was provided,"" say @PERSON3, a specialist in obesity at @ORGANIZATION1. Also, @PERCENT1 of all computer users snack while online, which only increases weight gain even more. Unfortunately those that spend alot of time on the computer are not usually okay with exercising either. Instead of outing down just a half an hour out of their computer time to play with the dog, take a jog, or try some aerobics, computer lovers usually just stay in front of the screen. That's too bad, because it causes health problems for them and maybe even the generations after them. Nature, is being ignored @CAPS1, more than ever. @PERSON1 can recall the time when the trails @CAPS2 runs were overrun with people. ""@CAPS1"" @CAPS2 says ""They're being overrun with woods and. Those are harder to act rid of that people."" But it's live, the trails and that to be fuller nature lovers are numbers. Because of today's new technologies, especially computers, the beauty of nature is being almost completely passed by. Some worry if it will fade entirely and instead of trying to maintain what's left, well just let it do so. Hopefully though, the next generation of people will reconize this horrible mistakes. Doctors, @CAPS3, all people alike are seeing more and more how computers affect family life. How often do you eat dinner with the whole family. When you don't, where are you most of the time? At the computer? That's what I thought. When computers and other technologies are available there is much less of a chance that you will actually interact with family and friends. mrs @PERSON4, an @NUM1 grade teacher in @LOCATION1, noticed that her family spent less time together than ever before when each family member got a laptop. @CAPS2 believes this is pulling her family apart. Do you? As you can conclude, computers have an awful influence, on society: people do not take, the time to stay fit, nature is being completely ignored, and Family interaction rates are poor. Whaat can we do to fix this problem? Just set a little time aside daily to observe these aspects of life. This way, life with computers will be beneficial after all.",11
453,"@ORGANIZATION1, The computer to me is very beneficial. I say that because if wasn't @CAPS4 the computers we wouldn't have as much knowledge about other contries like we do now. Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition. Also if you have to do in history you can go on the computer and find on him/her. So I hope you take this in consideration that computer are great @CAPS4 society.",8
454,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have reason to believe that computers and other similar modern technologie is breaking up the world we once were. Things such as computers are a main cause of @CAPS3 lacking exercise, interaction with family and friends, and is also a possible danger to ones mental health. The leading cause of obecity and an outrageous amount of overweight people in @LOCATION1, is the fact that people spend way to much time on computers, and not excersizing. I have recently found out that in the @DATE1's the average familly had one computer (sometimes none). Nowadays, the average familly has up to @NUM1, @NUM2, or even more! Furthermore, the percentage of obese peoples has sky rocketed since then, because people are almost always on the computer, rather than exercising like they should be. A major reason that modern technologie has hur t our nation, is that there is an immence lack of communication and interaction between families. Families are fighting/arguing more often, and spouses getting in divorces because they never get to spend time together. Studies have shown that nowadays @NUM3 of @NUM1 marages ends in a divorce, where as in @DATE2, it was @NUM3 of @NUM6. Advances in technologie have astoundingly increased since then, and people are on the computer/phones/other @CAPS4 which is separating families everywhere. When impubesent children are trying to grow and expand their minds, all they are doing is sitting on the computer, and not getting the brain nutrition they need. The students in schools today are the future leaders of the world. Now the parents should be thinking, if they want their children to do well, or exeed their expectation in life, then they should not be sitting on the computer all day filling their-heads with nonesence. Now, computers do have the abillity to be educationally usefull, but do children use them that way? The answer in no, and, ""@PERCENT1 of the time, neither do adults"", state @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION1. I hope you can agree on the fact that computers are causing more bad than good in familes all around the world. People are not getting the amount of exercise they need, aren't interacting with family enough, and these computers can become harmfull to the mental health of future generations. If famillies can minimize the amounts of computer-drawn activities, then I think parents all over the world can modify themselves about their childrens health.",10
455,"Dear to @CAPS1 this @MONTH1 concern, Computers do a whole lot now of days. You can play games, do homework, socialize but don't you think there are better things than that. Such as exercising, enjoying the beauty of nature, and most importantly interacting with family and friends. These are all the things that computers take away from people. Once you get onto a computer you never want to get off. If you look at it, it doesn't take much work and energy to use a computer. So if you eat and use the computer all day your not really burning any calories therefore you will gain weight. Computers make people feel lazy sometimes therefore they spend less time exercising. That is not good for your health at all. Exercising gives you energy and is good for you. Have you ever looked out the window and saw how beautiful nature is? When your on the computer chit-chatting with people and playing online friends do you think about what your missing. Everytime I use the computer I wish I could be outside playing and enjoying nature. Trees, flowers, plants, grass and lots of other things are what make up the earth, but some people don't apreciate those things. So next time your on the computer think about that. While your on the computer wasting time there is another homeless child wandering maybe looking for their family. Would you like to be that child who doesnt have a family or any type of friends? Lots of people think of their life without a family but it can happen anyday. So I believe instead of wasting time on the computer we should go and interact with family and friends. Even if its just having a conversation do it, maybe it can show them that you really care. In conclusion, I think that computers are a waste of time. I understand how people say it is used to comunicate with people but back then they didnt have computers and they communicated so we can to. Computes make you spend less time exercising, keeps you from enjoying nature and lastly interacting with family and friends. You won't go wrong if you listen to someone who uses a computer everyday.",8
456,Hi do you think that if you use the computers too much then you will not exercis and you will not enjoy the outside nature with talking and playing with your friends and family will do not because computers are need for over needs and one click can help lot of people and can save live and the more advances over technology become. We will all so advances like or help a person look for a need jod and you can still talk or chat with best friends or just your grand mom. The computer can help with your home work or someone to lern to talk in english and to jump start than new jod or store and so they can but that ther her will like and buy so if they like it they will come back for more to higher more people and to make it into lot of store and all so and good reson the computer is good to cook food and to make new resifes all in one clik of the mose.,5
457,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 our nain forest growing back, service that takes only a few second, and being able to find practically any answer to any question. What could cause this phenominon. The answer is computers. These electronic wonder help us and our planet in some many ways. because they are ecofriendly, efficient, and loaded with information. You @MONTH1 be asking yourself how computers are ecofriendly. Well, for starters they help slow the waste of paper. Did you know that the @LOCATION1 kills aproximately @NUM1 million trees a year for book. Computers help prevent this in several way. For example instead of sending a short letter to the police cheif asking about what the new driving law is. You could send an email and save the paper. Also if you wanted the newspaper staff to interview the people that survived the power plant explotion you could send them all an e-mail with instructions to the surviers house insted of giving out maps individually. So now you see how ecofriendly computers are. My next reason was the eficentcy. My dell laptop @CAPS2 home takes about @NUM1 min to iload, @NUM3 sec to get on the internet, and @NUM4 sec to get to another webpage. So say that I want to know how many legs a centiped has (parents don't know either) without a computer it would take @NUM5 min to get to the library, @NUM6 min to find a parking spot, and @NUM4 min to find a book about cenipeeds. In total thats a least @NUM8 mins but my computer would only take @NUM1 min @NUM10 sec about. Also if you wanted to ask a friend what she is doing on @DATE1. I would only take a few seconds to send an email and she would answer quickly back, because she most likely on the computer a. My third reason was because computer are loaded with information, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 library I might find @NUM4 book on a sudject but on a computer I @MONTH1 find thousand. Once I was doing a report on monarch butterflys. @CAPS2 the @CAPS3 library I found @NUM12 books about them, On the internet I found @NUM13 wedsites on them! Also books have general information like just @CAPS5 life, but the internet has specific information the @CAPS5 part in the enviorment. As you now know computers help not only humans but the eviorments this is because they are ecofriendly, efficient, and loaded with information.",10
458,"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 show that @PERCENT1 of humans in the @LOCATION2 alone spend most of their time on a computer or laptop. I believe that the effect of computers has a negative effect on humans because it creates people to have a lack in exercise and it limits the physical interaction with others. As a nation, we can lower the statistic above and create a better environment altogether. The amount of people that lack a sufficient quantity of exercise has risen in the past decade. Doctor @PERSON1, who is expert in the connections between health and computers, surveyed @NUM1 people. Out of those people, @PERCENT2 said they rarely go outside because theu are trapped in the cyber world. This shocking percent proves that only one in twenty people actually get some tyoe of exercise. @PERSON2 stated, ""this shocking @CAPS2 means that most -if not all- all people are unhealthy physically, which is a problem that must be solved."" @CAPS3 goes on to say that being on a computer for most of the day and not exercising is what contributes ti unhealthiness. In addition to lacking exercise, many humans are losing the physical interaction that they should have. As humans have become, modernized with technology, most humans lose the physical interaction that they world normally have encountered if they we not on the computer. @PERSON3 agreed with this statement and said, "" I am a college greaduate; I have a degree and all, but I wasn't always like this. When I was younger, I owned a computer. As soon as I got home from school, I would always go on the computer. I wouldn't talk to anyone-not even my family! If I could go back and change that, I would."" This statement proves that the lack of physical interaction with human is a crucial subject to touch on. @PERSON3 regreted it all and changed his ways once @CAPS3 got to high school. No one wants to live with regrets, so physical human interactions are necessary to live a non-regretful life. the lack of human interaction and lack of exercise are problems that need to be solved as soon as possible. In conclusion, using computers has started a growing epidemin in the @LOCATION1. The most important reasons as to why computers have anegative effect on humans are it limits the amount of exercise, and it almost destroys the physical interactions between humans. Thank you for your attention, and remeber one thing: Computers can always have a negative effect on many humans lives.",10
459,"People use computers everyday. There's so many reasons way the're always on. They could be talking to one of their family relatives. Also they're probally looking for jobs. There's many things and people shouldn't tell them what to do with their lives. Many people in @LOCATION1 use the computer to talk to one of their old friends and catch up on things. Also they could be talking to one of their family relatives. There's a thing called webcam and people in @LOCATION1 use it so they could see one another. Buisnesses people are always on the computer because they need to print out documents and they probally got to send something to another country. Buisnesses people also do lots of work on the computer. They can still exercise in @TIME1 for a quick jog, but also thats their choice if they want to stay health or not, plus they're busy people. Other hand people who go on the computer and who are not buisness people or they're not talking to family member or an old friend are students and parents. Tons of students in @LOCATION1 have projects everyday and they got to be on the computer to look up their information. Parents on the other hand also help out their children and they also talk to their relatives or these looking for a new home or job. If all those people are busy let them do their work they want for need to do. Once their done they could excerise but if they don't want to and other people told them to go not take a walk or anything healthy then it's their lost. We can't some them too. They're just getting better everyday and it's not effecting us. its effecting them. If they want to be on the computer they're also getting bad eye-sight because of too much light.",8
460,"Do you remember school projects sitting down bored and watching your @CAPS1 stations or sitting in the doctors office waiting bored out of your mind? Well no more! Since the computer was invented there have been many many advancements and all of those things are gone. There was once a time when the only way to do a project on a country was to look in the paper untill you found something now with computer advancements you can enter a country's came into google, a search site, and up comes @NUM1 things on that country. In fact @PERSON1 a expert on computers and inventor of one of the most advanced computers on earth says that searching for information is now @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2 eisier depending on the topic. Also you no longer have to work a redundunt type write that always makes mistakes that you have to retype. You can just use @ORGANIZATION1 and you type your essay. Anything speelled wrong is underlined in red so you only rarely have a spelling mistake. As a result of this increase in knolage, from a learning stand point computers are extremly good for mankind. My second reason that computers are extremely good for us is that they are entertaining. On your new laptop you can go on miniclip or addicting games, both gaming websites and play games. These game while not only are fun improve handeye coordination which helps with sports, driving, writirs and many other things. More advanced gaming computers called consoles such as the @CAPS2-box @NUM2, by @ORGANIZATION1, the @NUM3, the @CAPS3 by the @CAPS4 provide exteme gaming experience. One of the more recent games for these consoles is called @CAPS5 of @CAPS6! Modern @CAPS7 @NUM4. This game has an online system where you can talk to and play against people all around the world. Not only that but advanced games such as @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 improve eyesight. Studies show that playing a high action game @NUM4 hrs a day will improve eyesight more than eating @NUM6 serving carrots a day. My final reason that computers are good for you is that they take boring waits. If you've everyone to @CAPS10 you know that the lime can be @NUM4 hrs long. People used to wait that just standing there. Now people can pull out their @CAPS11 or @NUM8 player and listen to music. The @CAPS11 can take videos and pictures as well as play music, videos and games. If you are lucky enough to have an I touch you can check email, stocks, weather and news right on your @CAPS13 as well as buy songs which can be @NUM9 cheaper than @CAPS14. In conclusion all of this advantage in technology benifits us greatly. We can now learn about new exiting things have fun while improving eyesight and we don't have to wait.",10
461,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that if you allow you self to use the @CAPS5 @CAPS2 @NUM1 minutes a day at the most that will allow you plenty of time to go outside & excersize. Useing the @CAPS5 is fine in moderation, but if you are constantly on the @CAPS5 it can't be healthy @CAPS2 You (unless its your job) you should only be on the @CAPS5 @CAPS2 @NUM1 minutes to an hour a day!

462,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I Computers is a new technology that keeps on getting better and better. It can do many things like help you learn something new and see new/old friends. Even some people do online education. Also what a lot of people like about computers is the games. Computers are a great benifit to us and can be useful and fun. The computer can teach us many new and exciting things. There can be a lot to learn too. Somethings you could learn about on the computer are places, people, animals, plants, food, etc. I have once had to find a recipe for carmel apples and to do so I used the computer. Some people use the computer for there education. There are online college and online high school. Its like a new way to be home schooled. Not everyone can go to big @CAPS1 so it is easier for them to use an online college. Also, lets say your doing a project and you need information instead of rushing to the library you can use the computer and find it. There are many other things you can do on the computer like visit some friends. I friends, everyone has friends either new friends or old friends. Back then before computers if you wanted to talk to your friend you would have had to send a letter. With computer you can now send a letter faster then before. Its now called an email. Which you just type what you want and click..send it off to your friend. Not all use an email, some use instant messaging. An example of that would be aim or meebo. I moved from @LOCATION1 to hear and I have friends I don't get to see much. I bet there are many people that have that same issue. Well with the computer you can now see people! chat and see them. For instance @ORGANIZATION2 is a way to see your friends like that. Its a easy and fun way to stay in touch with friends and even you family. There is still more that a computer can do. Another thing it can do is play video games. They are so much fun to play and what I am talking about is video games. Kids them even teens and adults love. Whenever your bored you can go play online games. Or you can have games you purchesed and play them. They are entertaining and fun too! Even very little kids can play games. Sometimes you can even play with you friends online with a online game. I know when I get bored I go on the computer and play a game called @CAPS2 @NUM1. Computers are great and there are pently of more things you can do other than what I was taking about. I hope I have convinced I or showed you how computers are a benifit to us people.",9
463,"Some people @MONTH1 think that computers take up too much time for the important things. But really everything you would like to know is right there. You can learn about nature, cool websites even history. Here are my reasons on the effect on computers. First, you can learn so much about nature online. You can view many types of animals and study them. Learn about plant and the effect they have on life. Also, you can learn about many things on @LOCATION1 and how its changing. Secondly, there are many coll websites you can join. Theres games you can play to keep you occupied during the day. You can even chat online with friends or maybe find long lost friends. School sites are available for students of some studying or help. Lastly, computers show you so much about history. People who things and world famous people from back then compared to famous people now. Most important of all, the life changing story about and how it changes peoples life today. I hope I've you enough to agree with me. As you can see computers have many resources you can learn from learning websites and history arent even half of them. Think about! Thank you for listening",6
464,"Dear newspaper, I think computers are good for you because talk online, teach hand eye coordination, and other stuff too. One reason @CAPS9 he helps you with your hand eye coordination for example teach you how you look while typing. @CAPS3 we don’t learn hand eye coordination we won't know how to do other stuff that @CAPS9 hand eye coordination. The second reason @CAPS9 @CAPS1 you have a webcam you can use @CAPS1 for example when a family member @CAPS9 living in a different state you can see their face and talk to them like you do in person. The last reason @CAPS9 searching the web because @CAPS3 you want to get @CAPS4 ticits for a trip look online. @CAPS1's the best way to get them. researcher say @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say getting online @CAPS9 the best way because you can see when the @CAPS4 take off, when the next @CAPS4 also when to come back home. All in all I say that compuetrs are a good thing because they help with you hand eye coordination also. @CAPS3 you have a web cam you can see family members from different states and see the face and talk to them like you are talking In person. The last thing @CAPS9 searching the web for @CAPS4 tickets @CAPS3 you want to go somewhere far a way go online and see when the @CAPS4 and comes back because researchers says that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 People say that getting online for @CAPS4 ticket @CAPS9 the best way to get them. Ask your self woild you like to have the web to seach or not?",6
465,"Computers benefit society, people can socialize online with anyone. You can use the internet to communicate with people all over the world. I talk with my pen pal from @LOCATION2 almost all the time with vidio char, the most popular websites today are social. For example facebook, myspace, and twitter, thease days @PERCENT1 of people have an account on at least one of thease websites and that number grows everyday. @CAPS1 live has made vidio games a lot more social. @NUM1 in @NUM2 kids are playing with a friend they know while playing @CAPS1. By useing computers your hand eye coordination will increase significant key hand eye coordination is used in a lot of sports. ""I don't know if I'd be @CAPS2 good of a tennis player without useing a computer to boost my hand eye coordination. ""@PERSON1 you can use hand eye coordination to do stuf faster. I can copy notes so much faster because I can write and look at the bord at the same time. Wheather you relize it or not hand eye coordination is very inportent computers can improve hand eye coordination by @PERCENT2. People can use computers to learn online. When you go on the internet you can learn about cool places and plan vacations. For @DATE1 break me and my dad used the internet to learn about @LOCATION1 we then decided to go there and bought tickets. You can learn about interesting people in history. There are over ten billion articals about famouse people in history. On the internet you can also learn new resipys if you are a cook. ""@CAPS2 an @ORGANIZATION1 I learned most of my cooking online."" - @ORGANIZATION1. Online you can also learn how to improve your technice in sports. Before I joined the swim team I looked up on the internet how to improve your swim technice and how I qualifyed to go to @CAPS3 with my team because the internet inproved my time by two seconds wich was enough for me to go. I belive the computer is an amazing invention that has tremendosely inpacked socioty.",9
466,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people is a positive effect. Three main reasons are that people learn more about cultures, places, and some people work online. @CAPS1 first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they help you learn about cultures around the world. Learning about cultures is very important because if people travel they need to know how they can respect each other. @CAPS1 second reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they help you learn about places around the world the world. Learning about places is very important because you could get lost. It also helps you by telling you which places are famous to visit. @CAPS1 third reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because some people find jobs online. Other people work online. This benefits people in a positive way. In conclusion computers have a positive effect on people because its helps people learn about cultures, places, and jobs around them.",6
467,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 several reasons on way I that advances in technology are harmful to our socitey is because it opens doors to strangers on the outside world. Its also takes you away from family and friends. Lastly it also takes you away from enjoying life outside of the internet. One of my severl reasons on way I feel advanced technology is harmful to our socitey is because it opens doors to strangers @CAPS2 teens, adult's and etc. The probem with this is that you never really know whos on the other side of that door, that chat room people can miss guide you into thinking there someone who there not. @CAPS2 example theres a show called dateline. This show is about how young teens put there selev's online and grown or young men click on a picture of you and that opens up a chat line or as I say opening a door, you dont know who's on the other side of that door. So these men online makes these teens trust them and make them feel safe if they are a friend you ""hey can I come over sometime?"" you this young teen thinking thats your friend says yea sure. Dont forget you dont see his picture so he come's over and most of three men are looking @CAPS2 a quick fix. If you know what I mean. This is what go's on during dateline t.v show just imarge how many other kids or teens are out there doing the same thing the difference is they dont get caught. Secondly on why is harmful to our socitey is because it takes you away from your family and friends. It takes you away from your kid's family because that will start to fill as if you love that computer more then them. It take you away friends because they might say hey let's go out to the mall or @CAPS2 a drink youll probably say check up on somethings online. This will one move slowly away from you, all over a computer you will start to lose the people most important to you. My last reason on why you can harm society with teconogly is because it takes you away from living your own life and doing thing's you wanna do like online is a bunch of stuff that everybody else say's is cool. Do what you think and feel is cool. @CAPS2 example if someone posted something saying @NUM1 guys lodon is so cool you gotta go there but youve always wanted to go to @LOCATION1, @CAPS3 thing is that you do get to have enough air outside like your skin will get pail and icky and this is why I feel that way. In covlsion all though some people might think that advanced tencogly is good well cleary there not because they open doors to danger, take you away from friends and family. Also it takes you away from what life has to offer.",8
468,"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 is great concern about computers and wether or not people spend to much time sitting infront of the screen or not. I believe that people should be more aware of the time they are in the computers. Instead of ruining your eyes you should be exercising, enjoying, and being with family and friends. Exercising is a major part of every persons life and if you don't get enough of it you could become obeise. Obeisity @MONTH1 cause people to not like you or think that you are a slob. Although you might say that you don't care what others think, but in the long run it might be a mistake if you think this way. exercise will most likely rid you of almost any type of discrimination because you will look no different or even better than the average person. If you ever get the chance get a telescope and set it up in a spot where you can see the stars at night. Instead of keeping your eyes glued to the computer on a nice, sunny joy, go for a walk in the woods. As you can see, nature is much more beautiful than hundreds of tiny tots of colors forming an image of nature. If you find an image of a beautiful plant, why not go and see or feel the plant 'in person? Many programs are now available on computers that let you see people, but wouldn't you rather talk to him or her in real life? I sure would and I think most other people would as well. @PERCENT1 of the population of @LOCATION1 said that they would much rather talk to friends or relatives in person than on a computer screen. I feel that however possible, you should always talk to people in person and not through cameras and wires. I hope I have made myself clear that exercising, nature, and people in real life are all much better options than being in front of a computer for the rest of your life.",8
469,"Dear local newspaper, Computers are a waste of time! People that say they are helpful are just using that as excuse. Some people say they are good for research and talking to people. Both of these things you can do without a computer. Computers are just a money wasting thing that get in your way of life. People spend hours on computers talking to people. You don't need to do that. You can use a phone instead and call them. After a study they proved that talking on a phone is cheaper then using the computer. In this economy why wouldn't you want to save money while getting the same thing also on a computer you don't really talk to the person you are really just typing word to them. This can be very dangerous. Who know if the person talking to you is really the person you think. Why take the risk when you can just use a phone! Using the computer is like smoking. It is very addicting! People stay on computers for hours every day and don't get exercize. If you just sit there moving your hand you are not really burning calories. This is a huge problem! Obecety is already rising with the number of fast food places and computers are making it worce. And the worst part is parents don't care some children go on the computer for @NUM1 hours a day and there parents don't encorige them to go outside. Children need encorigment to get moviing or they will never start, and they will get bigger. We need to form a group to help stop this or before you no it @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 will be obeise. Another excuse that computer lovers do is they say they are doing research on a country. Even though this @MONTH1 be true there are other way you can do this. Why not ride your bike to the library and get a book on the country. By doing this you will burn calories and get to learn the same stuff you would have on the computer. Also not everything on the internet is true so you might have false information. By getting a book you know it's true. People that love computers will never get away from them over night it @MONTH1 take a month or two but if we act new we can make a change and put a stop to it. Computers are a waste of money. You can live without then very easily, and without them the world would be a better place. People are being lazy and use excuses on why they need a computer. If you are stuck on a computer for @NUM1 hours a day you will never have any family memories. All you will remembor is when you were on the computer, and who wants that.",9
470,"Dear @CAPS1, I @CAPS2 that computers has benefits to society. First, it gives and teaches you social skills. Next, computers can help you learn new things online. Finally, computers also teach you hand-eye coordination. In the following you will see why I @CAPS2 computers have its benefits to the society. First, computers has its benefits to society because it can teach or give you the social skills you need. On a computer you can interact with others from around the world and make new friends. Therefore, you can learn about their culture and what they do in their country. Also, you can talk and interact with family that does not live with you or is not with you in the moment. So as you can see, Computers has its benefits because it can teach you social skills. Next the benefits it has to society is people can learn things online. for example, you can learn how to use a computer if you don't already know how. Also, you could play online learning games for free or buy a @CAPS3 with more options for learning. Another example is you can look up recent or past events you want to know about and research it. So as you can see, Computers benefit society because you can learn all types of things online. Finally, computers how its benefits because it teaches you hand-eye coordination. for example, you can find all types of games using hand-eye coordination using the mouse and keyboard. Also if you just want time to go by you can use the computer as entertainment by chatting with other and playing games. Believe it or not, you can find boat loads of jobs that uses a computer for any of these also as you can see computers have its benefits because it teaches you hand-eye coordination and gives you some free-time entertainment. In conclusion, computers have its benefits to the social community. First, it helps you learn your social skills. Next, you can learn about any subject online for free if your not the one paying the internet bill finally, it benefits you by teaching you hand-eye coordination. So as you can see, I @CAPS2 that computers benefits society in plenty of ways.",8
471,"People are spending too much time on computers. People that spend to much time on the computer do not have time to interact with family or friends. People spened to much time on the computer. The kids that spend time on the computer get bad grades. They also get tired every easy. First of all people spend to much time on the computer. @PERCENT1 of kids spend @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours on the computer. I once spent @NUM3 hours on my computer on @CAPS1. A lot of kids go on @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and iTunes. My friend spent @NUM4 hours on those websites. People spend way to long on the computer. Another reason, kids that spend time on the computer get bad grades. @PERCENT2 of kids that spend a lot of time on the computer forget to study for test. Once I spent all night on the computer and the next day I failed a test. Kids forget to do homework to. My friend was having so much fun on the computer he forget to do his homework.

472,"Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have both possitive and @CAPS12 effects on people. However, I believe that there are more positive effects than @CAPS12. Some of these positive effects would be that they are essential for education, a very usful place to communicate, and they can be fun. My first reason for supporting computers would be that they are very eduactional. For example, you can research almost anything. If you are doing your homework and you forgot an answer. An other reason why @CAPS1 is educational is because you can type your paper on @CAPS1 so your teacher can actually read your handwriting. If @CAPS1 is messy. On the subject, you can work from home if you are sick or on vacation. But how do you get @CAPS1 to your boss? Email of course! wich brings me to my next subject; @CAPS2. Another resoursful thing about computers is @CAPS2. There are so many different ways to communicate; @CAPS1's unbeleivable. Take I @CAPS4 for an example. You can @CAPS5 to peoples cellphones. You can @CAPS5 to other people that are @CAPS7 or you can just @CAPS5 on some websites such as @CAPS9, @CAPS10, and tons more. You can also vidio chat with people on things like and @ORGANIZATION1. Those are just a few ways of communicating on the computer. Finally, I would like to tell you about the fun things you can do on computers. First, you can buy games from a store and download them onto your computer. Personally, The sim are my favorite. I understand that computer games can be a negitive thing because they are addictiing, but if you don't go on for hours and hours, then I don't see what the problem is. Also, they have educational games so learning can be both fun and educational. Another thing you could do is play free games or download the game from the internet do your computer so they are both fast and easy. To @CAPS11, Computers can be both @CAPS12 and positive but I chose to look at things through a positive eye and I think you should too. After all, computers can be educational, a social networks and fun. Son @CAPS13 my positive eye... You wont be sorry.",10
473,"Proven by @PERSON2 the best @CAPS1 major over @PERCENT1 of children either have desktops, laptops, or some type of internet access. What so you think about this? Well I the computers are takeing up people time (like children) and not letting them get their work done. Also, computer are not only letting people talk to their friend, but its causing @CAPS5 bullying. Finally, @CAPS1 are also just maken parents more stressed out because the have to pay another bill for internet. Children now and days come home change and log right into the computer and start talking to friends and lisening to music all this sounds good intell their report cards come back and they see they are failing half there classes. I remember when my friend @CAPS3 would go home change eat and log right inside the computer. As days went around the end or the year was she noticed she had two problems. She was getting over weight and she was failing all her classes. She noticed that getting on the computer was not neccesary so for the next mouth and a half she cut down on her time on the @CAPS1 did her homework and started this pushed me to beleave that children have @CAPS1. Proven by @PERSON3 the syber bully that over @PERCENT2 of children have bin syber bullyed or @CAPS5 bulllied someone. All this happen when children are not being watched or get bored and to pick on someone. What should we do people ask @PERSON1 and she says well take away the @CAPS1. I remember when I read about the year old girl on new channels.com and it was about @CAPS5 bullied but never. This shows that children all over the world can be getting syber bullied of any moment.",9
474,"I People spend too much time on the computer. A lot of people are on the computer for about the whole day. They should be spending time with family and friends. People never have enough time for activities. Also computer should mostly be used for talking with family and friends, homework,research, games @CAPS1 bored, and work. To begin with, people need to spend more time with family and friends rather than on the computer. For example @CAPS1 your mother or father asked you @CAPS1 you wanted to go out to dinner and you said no, I'm on the computer, that would just mean your obsessed with going on the computer. A lot of families are bing broken apart because people spend too much time on the computer @CAPS1 you have a friend over and they say I am bored and all you are doing is play games on the computer than that is just being rude because your friend is bored. So you need to get off the computer and spend time with your loved ones. Previously I stated how people spend time with loved ones, well people need to spend more time doing activities as well. A lot of humans sit on the computer and eat so over the time they eventually get fat. @CAPS1 you are gaining weight because your on the computer than you need to go do some activite to off that fat. @CAPS1 you are a teen and you are given the idea to play a sport and you it because computer is more important then is some serious obesession with the computer. As a result, the computer should be used wisely. The computer should be used to talk to family and friends, homework, research, work, and @CAPS1 you bored play some games little games on the computer. Those are probably the most important things that should most likely used for the computer. A lot of these things that I have listed are important because @CAPS1 you go on the computer just to be on and watch people talk then what's the point of wasting your time on the computer when you could be doing much more different things on the computer. For example, @CAPS1 you have homework such as vocabulary and you need definitions you can go to www.dictionary.com to find them, or @CAPS1 you just need to define a simple word. In conclusion, people spend too much time on the computer. They need to be spending more time with family and friends. Also people need to be doing more activities in their lives. Lastly, you should use the computer for useful things like homework or even very important research. So, as you can see humans spend too much time on the computer rather than doing much more important things.",10
475,"Not everyone thinks computers are good for you but they are a very good resorce to find information. It's not good to be on the compoler @NUM1 seven but to be on sometimes is not bad. A person who is on the computer all day and does nothing else except that, then that is not healthy at all. People just have to limit their time on how much they stay on the computer. Dont over due it! Computers are also very good for information as I said earlier. If you have a computer or a laptop and you need to find information on something the internet is there. For kids that need to do homework or a project and they need to look up some facts or information on something they could go on the computer for that. It is so much easier to do that then look for books that has all the facts you need. So computers have very good qulities and resources. They arnt bad or unhealthy unless if that is your life and that is the only thing you do. That is my opinion on computers.",6
476,"You must be insane! Computers are very important to society. My first reason is, computers can be used for research. Secondly, can be made. Lastly, you can talk and video chat. These are my three reasons why computers are important to society. If you want to know more send on. Firstly, computers can be used for research. For example, what if your boss wats to find the of products ? All you have to do is go to www.google.com, and look it up! Is is that easy. Also what if you need to do reasearch on @ORGANIZATION1 for school? Instead of reading books about him, you can type in his name, and theres your information. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids/adults use the computer for research. This is my first reason. Secondly, purchases can be made. What if you would like to buy a plane ticket to @LOCATION1 to help? You can go on the computer and buy a ticket at your convenience. You can order order all types of that needed to @LOCATION1. Or that a relative/friend can have a. How way simplier than going out and doing it yourself. This is my second reason. Lastly you can talk and video chat. You own a other people, and you all in diffreent country need a a video meeting. What if you have relatives that live far away that you miss alot? You can have a video family. this is my last reason. I hope you consider my reasons why computers are very important to society.",8
477,"Dear, local newspaper people @CAPS1's lot of computer that have help us with are planet. Like not letting us dive are cars for stuff. Learninging was easyer for every one with computers too. Then have comunications with people with computers. We should hate a box the has information in it, we should be glad we have something like that in are home. Why we don't need-in us cars sometimes if you have a computer. Like some people have desided that can have @CAPS1 own busniss so they us the computer to make one. Then if you don't want to waste time driveing to buy a te-shirt you can just go on the computer and buy one. Next the more we drive the more polution git in are atmisphier. If we did not have computers are planet will get @PERCENT1 more pulluted. Each year. Now do you want that to happen to the world? Last, we wont be wasting gas on are cars because we are using computers. If the computer was taken away people will still choose the lasy way and just drive cars. Learning is easyer for every one with computers like we don't have to look in a book to find something. Then @CAPS1 different learning programs to teach us a different language. Like for lots of people have college for people who did not. Last, it can help us do are homework if we have on it. I realy my second brain, it has . Now lot of. Third, communication are going to be a hole lot with computers. Say you dont have and you to send a lot. The computer to help you, it will allow you to talk to, then you can talk to other people like the japaness who know english so you now how @CAPS1 life is to yours. You can ask people question. Or just for fun you can play mind game with other people. I got to do alot of chating with my old friend by this and I miss them but if the only way I can talk to them with out my parents yelling at me bacause the phone bill is so high. The greater or go of a computer make us know we don't have do that many stuff. Like polute are air. Then we can learn fast without a book. Last, to alow us to talk to my old friend, so can every one beleve me that the computer is not that bad.",8
478,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, Are you always telling your kids to do their homework and get off the computer? Well, I might just be able to help. Computers do not benefit our society today. People are spending to much time on them; not enjoying the outdoors, and are taking away time to spend with friends and family. I believe having a limit each day on your computer might help solve these problems. The computers can be very distracting and you can use them too offten. Stairing at the computer screen can damage your eyes and kill brain cells. Thats one thing kids and adults dont notice. You need your brain cells for school. Joins and other activities, computers can also distract you from completing work, and then you have to stay up late to finish homework should come before the computer. Time flys by as your clicking and typing. The next thing you know as it's ten o'clock and your work is not completed. Since my schedule is so busy after school. I try to complete my work, then go to the computer before dance. This way I am my friends and relax. Taking time away from the computer is a smart idea. As it comes to @DATE1 time the weather is going to be beautiful and you don't want to waste a pretty day on the computer, @CAPS5 human body needs oxygen. Clearly, computers don't supply that. A great way to recieve oxygen is going outside for some exersize and energy. Playing outside can offer a lot more than a computer. You can swim, jump, or play sports. My doctor once told me, "" Everyone should have atleast an hour of exersize a day. ""You can't accomplish that by sitting at your computer. Next time there is sunshine out, no matter what season it is, go outside and take a break from electronics. Spending time with family and friends is a fun way to stay off the computer. Friends and Family are not people to take advantage of. They are people who are there for you when you are down and make you laugh. When your relatives come to town that you havn't seen in a while, You don't want to spend it on the computer. Talking and catching up with one another is a great way to re-connect. During family holidays, we don't bring our computers. We shut them off to spend time with each other. Friends and family are special gifts. So, don't throw away friendships or relationships with your family. Get away from the computer and bond. (did not finish)",10
479,"Dear, I strongly believe that computers are great. There are a-lot of great things you can do on the computers. A-lot of people are saying that computers have bad effects on people, like not getting enough exercise and spending time with your family. I do not agree with that because say you have family in a different town, city, or state. There is a website where you can webcam people from all over world with anybody, so that is a good opportunity and also it is free and you can do it at anytime and if you have a laptop, anywhere! My next reason is that you get to see places you have never seen before with direct pictures, like on commercials when our familly wants to go on vaction to a far place and you know nothing about it. You can go on the computer and look up the place and see what it is about and also see what other people said about. Like if it is really hot, or cold, is it a good experience for kids, anything you want, the computer has it. My last reason on why computers are good is because of studying, one thing that always happens is I leave my textbook home. I can go on the computer and see what we had to do. Also you can use the computer to study and learn easier ways to do something for any subject. Survey’s shows that @PERCENT1 of the kids who study on the computer pass there test and get a higher grade percentage +@NUM1. Also if a kid is studying and dosent know what a word is they can I look it up and figure out the definition and how to use it in a sentence. That is why I think computers are a great exercise for your well being and personality.",7
480,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that more and more people are using computers for excessive amounts of time a recent study confirmed this reporting that ""@PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's population uses a computer for more than @NUM1 hours a day"". That means people have less time to exercise, enjoy nature and socialize. I consider that the benefits of computers are greatly outwayed by the problems that arise from them to up, computers limit a person's health-both physical and social - and do more harm than good to siciety. Spending too much time on computers can deteriavate a person's health by preventing them from spending that time exercising take for example @LOCATION3, who goes on computer at least five times a week, for about four hours. @LOCATION3 has stopped playing soccer and because she prefers to spend time on facebook. Instead of recieving six hours of exercise a week. she now recieves an hour this has to @LOCATION3 gaining weight and losing health. The problem is there are millions of children like @LOCATION3 who are not getting enough exercise instead opting. to spend too much time on their computers. Another problem is that people spend less time enjoying nature. Now, they choose to surf the web instead. This nads to people caring less about our planet and animals. Nature is very important and can be extremely fun, so this is a shame. Furthermore, those who choose to spend overwhelming amounts of time on computers tend to interact less with family members. No longer do most children help cook, clean, do chones, or spend time with siblings. One mother says ""ever since my daughter got her new laptop, she hasn't gone once to play with her baby brother or friends"" unfortunatly the same is true for most teens today computers have limited nou, much time families spend together. In conclusion, computers do harm to society they keep people cooped up in their rooms, istead of exercising, enjoying nature, or having fun with their families and friends. In doing so, computers have become a mause to society. Therefore, @CAPS1 is crucial that people who spend more than an hour a day on computers use that time to exercise or socialize, even to do nothing at all would be better overall, computers are no longer beneficiery to society.",10
481,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I think computers are a good thing. It is good because you get to learn about forein places. Keep in touch with family and friends and it is good entertainment. First, computers are great to learn about forein places. On the computers you could research a place and look at pictures before you go. If I wanted to go to a far away place like @LOCATION3. I would go on the computer and find the best part to go to and I would look at different hotels to stay at the reviews it has gotten. Aslo, if someone were to do a paper on a different country or even state that they've never been to they would go on the computer. Sure, you can get the same info from books but you can filter out what you don't need on the computer. In my history calss, I had to do a report on the state of @LOCATION2. I have never been there so I want on the computer. Books could have given me the same info but computers are always up to date and accurate. Seecond, computers help you keep in touch with family and friends. There are numerous websites that allow you to share photos and talk to friends or family. I recently signed up for facebook and I am able to talk to friends instead of using mytexts and running over the phone bill every mont. My dad has a facebook too, he talks to people he hesn't seen since he moved heve from the @LOCATION1 white mountains. Some other sites are aim, aol, and myspace. Lastly computers are good entertainment. Computers allow you to see that concert you didn't go to or that movie that's never on tv. When I went to a skate board demo at skate lair I had tons of fun. The other day though, I started thinking about it. I went on youtube and type in""nike sb skate lair demo"" and clicked on it. i watched it and about halfway through it I saw my face! i was so exited. Computer also allow you to check the news and weather. This is good because if you are on the road and you want to see what's going on you can take out a laptop and checked the weather or news. That is why I think computers are necessary. Yes people do stay on four hours at a time but most people only go on for a small amount.",9
482,"Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 opinion on computers @MONTH1 be the same as others or different. I believe that computers help our society. They give us more knowledge on whatever subject we want, it helps us connect to family far away places and they even give us a better understanding of any place we can't see for ourselves. Some people feel that computers distract kids so they're never spending time with family. But what if one of your family members is on the other side of the world? @CAPS1 cousin lives in @LOCATION2 and the only way I can ever talk to him is through a computer. What if your a little kid and your mom or did go on business trips faraway for a very long time? You would use a computer to talk to them wouldn't you? Not everyone in your is always around you and when someone is faraway a computer is the way to connect. Because of computers kids don't exercise. What if your exercise happened to be hiking? In you get exercise and can expose the scenery. With a computer you can explore anywhere without even leaving your doorstep. Say your just a young kid and you're always located to see @LOCATION1 but you can never go there. What would you do? You would hop on a computer and check it out. You can explore any place you want with the click of a button. In school you learn about very historic people who have been dead for thousands of years. How would you learn more about them if they're gone? A computer has information about anyone you chance. You @MONTH1 not be exercising but you're expanding your knowledge aren't you. Yes you could go down to a library and take out a book on the person. However, what if the book doesn't have the information you are looking for? You could end up reading for hours when the certain information you want wasn't even there. A computer gives you anything you need in a matter of seconds. Why waste your time? Now is the time where our technology advances. Why waste your time on something when you've got what you need right at your fingertips? So what are you waiting for? Go learn what you want right now! Haven't seen your cousin in a long time? Start up your computer and get talking. The time is now!",10
483,"Dear newspaper, I have heard you are creating an article on if computers are helpful or non helpful to society. I find computers as a great addition to society because they play a big role in jobs around the country and in addition display accessible information to the @CAPS1 @CAPS8? Imagine how computers have helped shape the @ORGANIZATION1, do you want to give this blessing up? Computers have proven to be a big role in job profiles all over the world. Just think @ORGANIZATION1 a sales person for instance. Sales people need their computer to store data, like on @ORGANIZATION3. By the way a study was put into place by the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to find out how many jobs find it neccessary to have computers, and the results showed that @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 jobs in @LOCATION1 need to use computers. Dr. @DR1, a computer programmer at to go industries, mentioned on the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that ""computers show up sometime in everyone's life whether they like it or not, especially in jobs"". If you think about it, people that work with computers have less trouble calculatir or storing data than citizens without computers. Just think @ORGANIZATION1 computers this way a helping brain for those who work hard. Students love having access with information around the world. I bet that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people would agree with me, don't you think? Students around the world for example @MONTH1 need to research information for a topic in class. A @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2 in @CAPS6 mentioned that, ""I prefer using the internet for research in @ORGANIZATION2. It's much more fast than looking through books, and people around the earth place opinions online instead @ORGANIZATION1 a book with a few authors."" @CAPS7 day @PERSON1 was in the library with the rest @ORGANIZATION1 his class, assigned to researching his topic in a book. He read five books and only got a half @ORGANIZATION1 a page @ORGANIZATION1 notes for his assignment. The following day he was allowed to work on the @ORGANIZATION2 computer and got three pages @ORGANIZATION1 notes. ""I was so releived to log on to the internet"", @PERSON1 reported to me. A survey was set up by the @CAPS8 foundation to see if students prefer computers over books and @PERCENT3 said yes. Do you want students @ORGANIZATION1 all ages to participate in researching on the machine they favor most? Well I dearly hope your answer benefits the children in @LOCATION1. From young students to adults, computers have become a favorite machine @ORGANIZATION1 modern day technology. Computers are a magnificent part @ORGANIZATION1 society. @MONTH1 I remind you that computers benefit many jobs in @LOCATION1 and in addition aid students by showing information about everything there is to know. I sincerely hope you share my feelings about this matter. What is your vision on computers today?",10
484,"Dear @PERSON1, Computers are very helpful in daily activities, but computers have a bad side. Some users are addicted to their @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, they are away from friends and family, and they are not exersizing it if fun to use the @CAPS4 but you should not use it too much! Some people are almost addicted to their @CAPS4. I cant blame them they can charge their ipod, tweet, listen to music, palying games and much more all at the same time! computers are great, but using it too much can make you miss out on tons of activities. People almost feel (some do) that they HAVE to go on facebook to harvest their crops in farmtown, or control their @LOCATION1 on @CAPS3. They get so wrapped up in it that they miss out on their important daily activities. It shouldn't  that for but its became an epidemic, eveybody is being sucked into their computers! People who are on their @CAPS4 @NUM1 are away from their friends and family! they are like oh i haven't talked   his surgery i wonder how he is! Lets see! They go on and  You can talk to someone in just a click! Talking to someone  facebook or twitter is no the same as talking to them in person! Its like people think computers is     @CAPS4 take people away from their friends and family and them talk only on facebook  .When people on the @CAPS4 they become lazy! A person who is @CAPS4 addict will say "" @CAPS5 supposed to go to they gym but let me check my twitter first!"" two hours later then they go the gym! People don't exercise as often as the should! When people are going to lay on the @CAPS4 for @NUM2 minutes it takes @NUM3 hours! They have to sign in, chat with their friends, check their mail look at their tweets look at their restaurnat  check out videos on youtuve and do all other kinds of things! Computers are good but have sideeffects getting addicted, being away from friends and family, and not exercising. @CAPS4 addicts should minimize their time on the @CAPS4!",8
485,"Dear @CAPS1, ""@CAPS2 at @CAPS3 killed in a horrific acident"" is the title that flashes across the screen. Then another, and another. What is supposed to be @NUM1 minutes grows into an hour or two that take away from your family. I can see why this @MONTH1 bring up many conflicts; as computers can be very helpful. However, I feel that more often they negatively impact the general public. For one, there are many sites out there that portray false information. Plus, computers begin to consume the rest of peoples' lives. When it comes to these technological devices there are pros but there the cons can easily outweigh them. To start, computers are loaded with viruses, scams and internet predators. So easily someone can steal credit and information by placing offers that seem ""too good to be true."" @CAPS4 you listen to your instincts, then you'll know that they are. But, many people who don't know any better fall for these traps. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people have been scammed some time in their life I can clearly remember when someone. I know thought they were buying a pair of boots. Later That day, they got a call from the credit card company warning them about the purchase. These days you have to be so careful when you're on the computers. When my friends and I were learning about evaluating websites in computer processing class we came upon a site that seemed reliable, and accurate. We were all shocked when we learned that everything about it was fake. Computers can put people who @MONTH1 not know any better at risks. I strongly feel that sites like these and many others have a negative impact on the public. in addition, computers steal much of peoples' time to the point where family, 'doing homework and exercising is limited. I can understand the effects of too much exposure to computers because I see it everyday with my younger brother. Once he begins his video interactive games, homework is pushed a side. The only words from his mouth are, ""@CAPS5, just one more game!"" I suppose you can infer how this turns out: one game, turns two and so on. It isn't only children either. Many of my own friends are update status or pictures on @CAPS6 for three hours every night. Isn't their a point where we can draw the line. between going on for ten minutes and letting the computer control your life? When surveyed ;the majority of students said that they spent at least two hours on the computer every night. When games and instant messaging starts to take away from studying and exercise there is a huge issue. Computers take away peoples' free time and can negatively impact their grades and fitness. So, I ask you to consider the benefits of computers; but also look for the negative effects. You will realize that their are more than you would believe. Support me on this by limiting usage of computers and by helping the public see the dangers that these technological devices @MONTH1 bring. Computers can harm relationships, finances and your personal life more than you would think!",11
486,"Hello, I decided to write in to the paper on the topic of computers, and how they benefit society. Comuters are powerful machines, and can be used completing otherwise menial and boring tasks. They benefit people in many ways, like they are very useful in buissness, helpful in education, and connect friends and family together. Computers are uselful in buissness and are an extremely important tool in a common workplace today, and make work get done much more efficiently than if they didn't have computers. One reason Computers are so useful in the workplace is because computers can storee far more data that can be put on paper. Also, they can do jobs and processes very quickly, which is important in the workplace. They can also be used for sending important information quickly and without much trouble. These are all valid reasons comuters are beneficial in buissness, and help things get done. Computers are important today's schools and educational programs becasue they can help students work in a more efficient fashion. ""@PERCENT1 of all surveyed students said they would rather type a paper for school than write on by hand, and shows that they value them in their education."" said @PERSON2, a professor at @ORGANIZATION1. This shows that Computers are important to students, and are used their benefit. In addition to students writing papers, computers are being used by teachers and school systems for grading, attendance records, and more. The teachers at my school are using @CAPS1 @CAPS2, pieces of hardware that are directly connected to computers, and can be used instead of white @CAPS2, and I see that students are getting more involved in class, and focused, because this computer technology is being used. All of these @CAPS3 are reasons computers are helpful in educational proceeses, and should continue to be used. Many people want to be able talk to there friends and family when they are bored, and because of computers and social networking websites, and instant messaging programs, this is made much easier. ""@PERCENT2 of teens have at least one sacial networking site they visit on a regular basis."" said @PERSON1, a phycologist, who speciaizes in teens, This shows that people use these sites, and that they like them. Families that are separated because one @MONTH1 have moved out of the house recently might want to communicate with one another, and because of computers, they can. There are multiple ways that they could use their computers to keep in touch, like instant messaging systems mentioned before. Being able to communicate with one another makes theses people happy, and benefits society. Overall, being able to communicate through computers is an enjoyable thing for many people, and is important to society today. To conclude, computers contribute to society in ways that make it much better for everyone. Whether it's through helping buissnesses being more efficient, giving students the ability to work faster, and in a way they prefer, or if it's helping people stay in touch, computers are always benefiting society. These machines hardly ever slow people more thant manually doing the work would, and the positive influence they have far outweighs the bad they do.",10
487,"I think it is okay for people to use computers because they get to learn new things and meet new people. I don't think it's a bad idea to use computers because some people who have jobs works on computers all day. @NUM1 each sometimes computers can be a distraction but computers can help you alot. I think using computers can help you learn new things and meet new people. Slick, slack, slick, thats the sound of people typing ont he computer and meeting new friends and having a good time. When you learn something new like a rat is as big as a house. You get excited and feel your the smartest person in the world. I dont think its a bad idea to use computers because some peole who have jobs work on computers all day. I think people who uses computers all day while the're at work dont have to be classy, topuler or trendy, they just working to help themselves and theior family. YEah sometimes computers can be a distraction but computers can help you alot. They can help you learn new things meet new friends and give you something to do when your bored. i remember the time when I was bored and I went on the computer to google who @PERSON1 was and I found out she was a famous sinher, someone I didn't know but heard about. Chantrail @CAPS1 a @NUM2 grade student says ""only people who want to learn something or meet new friends will use the computers.

488,"Dear newspaper, I think computers have a good effect on people. Computers are very helpful to many it gives them an education, and they can interact with many people. Computers can be very helpful to many people. Working with computers can give people extremly well hand-eye coordination. Dr. @PERSON4 said, ""In recent surveys and tests, I have noticed a major increase with hand-eye coordination of @PERCENT1 all thanks to computers. ""Computers is also a way that people can learn to type in a recent survey at @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1-more students know to type, thanks to computers. Computers can be very helpful to business people with creating power points. Instead of making a really big poster board for @CAPS2 @CAPS1 project, I made a power point instead that was so much easier. Computers can be very helpful to many people. Computers are used in many schools to help teach students about new things. For example, students can learn about interesting places that they never knew about. ""@CAPS2 friends is moving to @LOCATION1 and she has no idea what it's like, or where it is. So, we looked it up on the internet and found out so much cool stuff about it, "" says @PERSON5 computers can also teach students about new cultures. At @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT2 of the students learned about @NUM2 new cultures in one year, thanks to computers. Not only can computers tell people about interesting places, but interesting people. I never knew that president @PERSON2 had @NUM3 brothers, and gre up in @LOCATION2, did you? Computers can be used in schools to help teach students about new things. Computers are used by many people to interact with another. using computers is an easy way to talk with friends. Using instant messenger is free! Now parents don't have to pay annoying phone bills anymore! In a recent survey done in the town of @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @PERCENT3 of the people there thought that using computers to talk to friends was alot easier. Computers can help people meet new people online.

489,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe computers and excelling technology benefits society because it can help with hand eye coordination, it will be an easy way to learn about faraway places and cultures, and your able to save and use your time more wisely. First of all every person needs hand-eye coordination, if you didn't you would either thore a ball in the comlplete other direction or you'll get hit in the face with it. Computers benefit childrens education too, they can help you discover and learn about far away places. For example if a student is studying @PERSON3 @LOCATION1 in their @CAPS2 @CAPS3 class, @PERSON1 in @CAPS4 class or maybe @PERSON2 in music class, instead of pulling out the old, dustty biography book it would be easier to look them up on a search engine. Lastly the computer benefits everyday working or stay at home parents because if you have to get in contact with a cetain person or business quickly you don't have to take the chance of having to go look in the phone book and the person or business isn't in it, just go to to @NUM1.com type in a last name or business name, so your all set. Also if your child is being a nuisance screaming and running around the house you can just set them up with an educational game so you can get your house-hold chores finished. Those are three of the most important reasons why I think computers benefit society. They are hand-eye coordination, learning techniques and saving everyday people time.",7
490,"Dear @CAPS1 post, I know that people are spending way to much time on computers instead of being out side. People are becoming adictied to computers. People are spending way to much time on computers because there addicted to them, over weight, and not getting any exercise. I am telling you we need to address this matter. People have become addicted to computers. @PERSON1 says that in @DATE1 there were @NUM1 people useing computers, and it @DATE2 there are nearly @NUM2 million people using computers, that’s a big increase in the last copple of years. People are becoming more addicted because of facebook, twitter, and much more computer sites. Yale says that in @DATE3 the number of people on facebook was only @NUM3 thousand in @DATE4 there is over @NUM4 million people using facebook, I don’t know about yoe but that seems like an addiction to computers to me. People are getting tramensly over weight. One cause of this is addiction to computers, people just sit infront of there computers and eat and eat and eat until there over weight and unhealthy. Dr. @PERSON2 says that in the last @NUM5 years the average weight of a person has gone up @NUM3 pounds due to them sitting in front of their computers and eating. Doctors say thay can’t do any thing about peoples weight unless they turn off all of there computers witch they don’t think is possible.

And by sitting infront of a computer eating, you'r not getting your exercise that is needed so people are getting fat. Dr. @PERSON3 says that people need to be aware of this problem. Dr. @PERSON3 also says that in the last @NUM7 years the amount of exercise people are getting has decreased @PERCENT1 that’s why people are getting fat. He also says that it’s due to sitting infront of the computer and eating. People are getting no exercise due to computers. I’m telling you this is a huge problem that we need to address. People are becoming addicted to computers, there getting over weight, and getting no exersise. Pleas @CAPS1 post listen, it’s a problem, but it is your dessision.",9
491,"Dear Newspaper, ""@CAPS1 no!' I forgot the deffinition to this homework problem and I don’t have my notes. Now, in this situation a computer would be very helpful to just type in the word and get a whole bunch of results. This is why I believe having access to a computer at all times is very helpfull because you can find information that you've been needing. You can get in touch with a friend if you need to or just to talk to lostly if you are just sitting around and having nothing to do you can just go on the computer and discover things you @MONTH1 not have known. Having access to a computer is a real and very helpfull because if your just having a conversation with someone and you forget a name of an important fact you want to tell them, you can always just look it up. For me, a lot of the times I just need information about maybe a sports player of facts about a famous event. Since our technology is so up to date the computer is right there sitting with many of the helpfull facts we would like to know. Friends are a big part of my life and I love just to talk to them and see how they are doing. Again, our technology is so advanced now that there is a bunch of websites where we can talk and see how we are doing. A big reason why being able to talk to friends and family is helpful is for taking to people that are very far away and the ones you dont normally see. On a computer you can talk to people from not only all over the @CAPS2.S.A but even in other countrys! Finally, the times I find having a computer around me most helpfull is when I am just bored with nothing to do! I can just visit a whole bunch of educational websites on things I @MONTH1 have learned in school or wanted to learn. On the internet there are many things to keep you occupied like games or ou can even watch movies from your home onto the computer! If you have a computer around your house you should not be bored because there is many things you can be doing or even learning! Having a computer around your house is so helpfull, you can have fun but your even learning how to be good with technology at the same time. Computers are the future and its a good one. So I suggest you pick one up and just have a blast, you wont be sorry.",9
492,"Dear local Newspaper, I think people using a computer has a effect. using a computer can help people in many ways. You can talk to people world wide, it helps you stay organized, and you can create very useful things like a or a power point using a computer. Talking to people world wide can be a very useful thing. Say that you have family members that live in @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2 you can keep in touch with them by e-mail or video chat. Also, if there is a national and nedds to talk to the other, governers around the world for advices help he can do that quickly and easily. Using a computer can also help you stay organized. For example my uncle helps file takes computer to make sure all of the files get saved and they are in the light places. Imagine all of the papers and space he would use if he had to do by hand or didnt use a computer. Computers also help teachers. Teachers enter grades, e-mail parents, and even create test or quizes and they know it will be nice and organized in the computer files instead of in paper files on their desk. Speaking of quizzes that teachers make on the computer, they can also make alot of other things like power points. Power points can help them put alot of information on the screen and it helps the students learn, which is a positive effect. If you had a small business that just started out you can make a brochure to help advertising. Lastily, you can go on microsoft excel and make a schedule that can help your employees know who has to work when, or students can know what class they have to be in at what time. In conclusion, computers are very helpful in everyday for alot of different people. Talking to worldwide can help you stay in, so you dont lose connection with your. They also have effect they help business people stay organized. Lastly, they can help teachers create test or powerpoints which helps kids learn. So in all, I would have to agree that computers have a positive effect on society. Also, doesn't typeing your newspaper articles make it more organized and quicker to print them?",8
493,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In @CAPS2 opinion, computers are fantastic! Therefore, I believe computers have a great effect on peoples life. Three reasons to support @CAPS2 decision are many jobs use computers, instead of using a dictionary or thesaurus, you can just search it and it is a big help at home/around the house. @CAPS2 first reason is, that many jobs in the state, or nation use a computer. Statistically saying @NUM1 out of @NUM2 jobs in the state use a computer or technology relating to a computer hardware. If you honestly think about it, if you were a teacher, a factory employee, etc, you practicly wouldn't even be able to do your job without it. We have learned alot from the new inventions that came about in the past decade, or two. If we have learned anything in the past @NUM3 years, it would be the ""@CAPS1 the time you spend on the computer, but go on because you will learn some things you never know before."" @CAPS2 second reason is we have alot more useful search engines than @NUM3 years ago. In/around the @NUM5's, if you wanted to find information, the only resort was...books. Yes, I mean reading is great, but now having the computer is faster and easier. All you do is go to @ORGANIZATION2 and type in what you want to find. Then it comes up in about @NUM6 seconds with around @NUM7 links to websites to help you out. Just think, now theres no table of contents, just a link and a click! @CAPS2 third reason is it is a big help around the house/at home. In the state of @LOCATION1, about @PERCENT1 of people have a laptop or a computer in their home. But, this isn't a bad thing, because it can help with so many things. Including, help with the children, help with cooking, with organizing, anything! Let's say you don't know what time ""@CAPS3's"" friends birthday party starts, no worrys just ask his mom on @CAPS4! Or you need a recipe for dinner, find it on cooks.com. This makes life alot easier and puts a extraordinary effect on your life! In conclusion, having a computer in your life is great, because so many jobs use computers, theres so many searching things, and it is helpful at home. So, computers have a awesome effect on people's lives!!",9
494,"Dear editor of local newspaper, @CAPS1 you know that the average person spends three or more hours each day on the computer? The time taken up by staring at a blank screen can be spent helping the community, exercising, or simply having fun with others. All this valuable time is wasted because of computers, spending large sums of time on a computer lessens your time with family and friends, causes health concerns, and alternately @MONTH1 became addictive. First of all, computers @MONTH1 prevent you from spending time your family and friends. Often people come home from work or school just wanting to relax, so the seek comfort from the web. However, a more relaxing activity could be playing a game with your family or going out with your friends. After all, nobody lasts forever and your time with once everyday. This precious time is taken away by computer technology, which will last longer than any human and doesn't even provide comfort when someone is down. For example, a teenager would be on the computer who is making fun of them. This does not benefit the and the bullying could lead to depression deceded with her family or friends, they could probably share a few and make everyone feel good, @CAPS2, time spent on the computer is less spent with family and perends. Secondly, computers can bad for your health, at a the eyes, and people with trouble seeing. typing a lot way the need for spending more time on the computer gives you learn time for examples and often temple you if someone finds a website they really like, they will quite went to visit it often, perhaps even multiple times a day! Along with websites, @CAPS3 games and networks are also very popular and addictive. Computer addiction can lead to health problems (as talled about before) and withdrawal symptons when you try to stop. It's very important that people stop spending a lot of time on the computer to make sure an addiction is prevented before it can even start. In conclusion, computer technology is hurting the human race and could be preventing greater things to be happening in individual's lives. There is less time to do things with your loved ones, more negative impacts on your a rising number of computer addicts because of our modern technology. However, all there, could be prevented if people simply spent less time on the computer.",11
495,"Computers have gotten more advanced over time. They have even gotten smaller and smaller, and yet people still don't understand the dangers that computers have on society and their personal life such as; stress, addiction, and cyberbulling. I am here to write about how computers are a nuisense in our lives. First and for most, computers are one of the laeding causes of stress in daily life. About four out of every ten people that are stressed are stressed out because of their computers. For example, if you were writing an important document or sending an email to your boss about work and your computer suddenly crashes, would you be upset? Would you feel like you want to rip your hair out and throw that computer out the window? I'm pretty sure that you would because your data is lost, you will have to restart your computer and, worst case senerio, take your computer to the electronic store to get it fixed. Another cause of stress is if someone hacks your computer by uploading a virus. Hacking was @CAPS1 become a world wide sport. There are books and instructions on how to hack a computer and the government can't do much about that since the first amendment gives you the write to publish what you (freedom of speech and press). Just look what happened in @LOCATION1. A computer hacker hacks a computer and shut of power to an entire city for about @NUM1 days. Also if someone upload a virus into your they can take all of your personal information, like your social security number. These two factors will cause major stress in you daily life. Secondly, people spend too much time on the computer at home. A recent survey shows that six out of every ten teenagers spend more that two hours on the computer. This make them less social meaning they won't spend time with friends, family, or even try out for sports. They won't get the recommended one hour of exercise a day.",8
496,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 studies have been conducted over the past few years, and they show that people of all ages spend @PERCENT1 of their free time on the computers. This is becoming a problem all over our state and country. Computers are consuming the lives of everyone. An anonymous source claims that they use their computer to contact old friends. A study shows that phone usage has gone down because adults and teens would prefer to email or instant message a friend. This results in sitting in front of a computer screen waiting for a responce. @PERSON1, a student at @ORGANIZATION2 says, I go on the computer once or twice a week. i dont use it all that much because I'd rather be out having fun with all my friends rather than be holed up in a room by myself."" @CAPS2 people believe it is a way to be more social, but it really isn't. It's just sitting in front of a screen talking to people you @MONTH1 not even know too well. When you sit down in your computer chair and start e-mailing away, you aren't doing any physical exercise. The @CAPS2 movement people will normally do is get up and go to the bathroom. Then they are right back in a chair, making minimal movements. @PERCENT2 of people who sit in front of a computer end up obese because they don't burn any calories. Since they don't relesase many endorphins, so they aren't very happy. If they got up and went outdoors to do physical exercise, they would be fit and happy . Often, teenagers feel more powerful when they are using a computer. They find it easier to disobey rules their parents set for them. Teens also find it easier to bully other children via the internet or social networks. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students at @ORGANIZATION2 middle @ORGANIZATION2 confess to being the target of malicious bullying online. @NUM3 out of @NUM2 confess to be bullied, and they definitely don't want to be bullied on facebook or myspace where everything is out on your profile for your peers to see. Teens should have limited time on the computer, so they don't do anything they will regret in their future. Therefore, adults and teens should be aware that using a computer is fine, but they shouldn't over use the luxury of a way to find information quickly or contact a friend in a foreign country. This generation needs to be reminded that their whole life shouldn't be spent on the computer. Probably less than @NUM5 minutes a day should be spent checking your e-mail or instant messaging a friend. Then you should go outdoors and spend time with your friends and family.""",9
497,"Dear newspaper, Have you ever grabbed a nice cold cake and sat at your computer desk? I @CAPS1 I have computers do benefit society. One way computers benefit society is it doesn't make people stand arcuna a book store or libray hours at a time. Another way computers benefit society is by letting people chat with people all over the over world. The last way that computers benefit society is it teaches people handeye coordination.

498,"Computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers help people in many ways. They teach people about history and faraway places. They also are a great way to yourself. Computers also are another way to comunicate to people for away it only a few houses down. Computers have a of knowledge and more is added everyday. Everyday i go on the computer i learn something new. You can search the word @LOCATION1 and instantly have millions of web pages in fron of you that all had new knowlage and exciting things about @LOCATION1. Computers are much faster than having to go down to local library and look for a book that has the information you need. You can also find diffrerent veiws and perspectives of a subject online. Depending on what website you go to you can get opinions on certain places and events, which you cannot find books at the library. Computers have a amount of knowledge instantly and also some opinions of things. Computers can also entertain you. There are many entertaining website online that you can go to when you bored. There are books and magazines you can read at anytime you want. If you like to read then check online, these @MONTH1 be a book you enjoy free of charge to read. Some people like to play games. On the computer you can find almost any game you want to play. These are board games, video games, strategy game, adventure games, and many many more than that. I could go on for hours listing at the different types. If you like sports you can look on the internet and find pages about different sports. You could find ways to improve how you play or you to play that sport. If you like to watch @CAPS1. you can also do that on a computer. Some @CAPS2.V programs put the diffrent episodes online so people can easily view them just by one click of the mouse. Computer can anybody who uses it. Computers help tech you things entertain you. but they also can communicate to your friends and family. Many programs let you to people through the internet. You could send emails to your cousin half way across the world. In emails you can attach pictures and files with text to communicate. These are various programs. IM means instant messaging, that means that instantly you message to another person using that program. You put a message in and away it goes instantly reaching ther person you trying to teach. Now thse are even more to communicate. you can make audio calls to a person using the computer. It is like a phone just not.Web cams make it possible to record and send video instantly, but can also uses to talk to one through a video call. The program connects you to your friends or family and you can see them thourhg a video. computers are a great way to comunicate with others. Computers help in a positive way. They give you access to an amazing amount of information. They can you. Computers also great way to communicate to people no matter how far away that person is. I would completly say that computers are a positive thing.",10
499,"More and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Well, to me it does benefit society in many ways like, learning online. You can learn many things online, you can practice math, reading, and even writing. You can also have fun online if your bored at home and have nothing to do. Also, you can interact with friends and family members, by email etc. When your online you can learn alot of things. If your at home, and you need to study for a test, you can go online and study. You can also learn more, because you can learn how to do a math problem if you don't know it, or just catch up on reading. People sometimes need a computer because they might be bored, so they can go online and play games and have fun. People, especially kids get bored at times, so they can just go on the computer and play games and trivias so they can still learn. Computers can let you interact with your family and f riends. You can e-mail or webcam. if yopu haven't talk to someone a long period of time you can just go to the computer and talk to them. If you want to find a @CAPS1 school classmate that you haven't talked to in years, you can now. Computers do benefit the society, In my own opinion we do need computers. If parents do not want their child on websites they don't approve of, the parents can always block those websites. Computer are really nessacary they can help in a huge way.",8
500,"In my opinion, I do believe that computers are good for you. I agree so because one, it can help you to communicate with other family members around the world. Two, it can teach you new languages you really desired to learn, and three, it can keep you updated on whats happening around the world. First, i believe that computers are good for you because it can let you communicate with your long-lost relatives you hardly see anymore. For example, if you miss any of your family members, you can simply go to your computer and search them up so you can type to them or talk to them through via chat mode, then you won't ever have that missing feeling anymore since you have a computer. In addition, computers can teach you how to learn new languages you alway's wanted to know, like, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2, or even @CAPS3 if you wanted! You can just simply go to your computer and type in ""language of @CAPS2"", and listen what it tells you of @CAPS2! Moreover, computers can keep you updated on whats happening around the world! It is way better to see it on computers than on tv's bevause computers give you more information about the situation of the event! Likewise, you could click, ""locate area"", on the computer and see in which area the incident took place in. You could also see the video's, behold the images, and seek the location of it on the computer. Sadly, my lecture has come to an . Those were my three main reasons why computers are good for people: You can communicate with long-lost relatives of yours, you can learn new languages, and therefore be updated on the qhats happening around the world. Would'nt you wan't to uphold those amazing events also?",8
501,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 years computers didn't exist, but now many people are having internet in their homes. But to some, the effect its giving on the people is negative. However, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people in many ways. Such as, the internet allows people to keep in touch, gives them technology skills to prepare them @CAPS1 more hi-tech jobs; and allows them to find and learn about new things. Dont you think computers help society? People live in all parts of the world, and those that are lucky get to meet a lot of people from different places in the country. But, you can't talk on the phone due to long-distance calls; so with a computer people don't have to lose touch! Its quite easy @CAPS1 people to talk with others from anywhere without having to actually see them. Computers are an easy way to stay in touch with family, too. Therefore, people can talk to their distant relatives from all over when you don't even have to go visit them. Having a computer helps people to keep distant friends and family close in touch. Lets face it, the world is relying more and more on technology and computers. But, if young people start using computers sooner then in life it will make it easier to get a better job. Lots of jobs ask @CAPS1 technological skills in order to be hired; so having a computer when younger automatically prepares young adults @CAPS1 life. Besides that, there is a computer injust about every work place that is up-to-date; restaurants, hotels, retail stores. and even in construction business. Nevertheless, computer skills aren't just a good skill to have; they are a necessary skill. Last, Computers are a faster and easier way to find new things and learn more about different topics. Instead of looking through various books and encyclopedias @CAPS1 researching, why not search the topic? Although, the computer and internet shouldn't completely replace books, it is a valuable researching tool. Someone that has never been to the pyramids could easily just research the pyramids and see amazing pictures, ancient history on them, and learn so much. Computers can help you learn so much about the world without having to leave your house. Now is the time to make your decision on whether or not you think computers are giving a positive effect on people. @CAPS1 the reasons of keeping intouch, giving",10
502,"Dear newspaper, In my opinion computers do benefit society because a computer is like a big electronics dictionary and they help our soldiers stay out of the line of fire. Computers benefit our society because they are like an electronic encyclopedia. Instead of leasing through a dictionary page by page trying to find a word, all that you would have to do is go on the internet type in @LOCATION1 and in the search box type in the word and every thing pops up. When i have to write a paper on someone I usually use the internet. The other day I had to write a paper on @PERSON1, so I went on the internet, found a website, took notes, put them into my own words and made a works called page. I thought that was easier then finding time to you do a and then find out there  only childrens books on that person. And you can also look up places like @CAPS1 @LOCATION2, or if you need to find out where a place is use @ORGANIZATION1. Computers also benefit our society because they are like big cellphones with a huge keyboard. My big sister is always on the computer using @CAPS2 talking to her friends. This helped her learn to type. Also there are new things like @CAPS3 where you can play games with your friend and talk to them while youre playing. Lastly computers benefit our society because they help keep our soldiers out of the line of fire. When I watch futureweapons I see unnamed helicopters that can be controled from hundreds of miles away. Also there is a robot used that digs out mines which saves many lives. When I interviewed @CAPS4 @CAPS5 from the military he said, ""@CAPS6 use those helicopters all the time. @CAPS6 also love how noone has to be in the helicopters so @CAPS6 don't have to worry."" In conclusion computers benefit our society because they are like big electronic encyclopedias, they also are like big cellphones with huge keyboards, and lastly they help keep our soldiers out of the line of fire. In school @CAPS6 use computers all of the time for writing papers and researching different things.",9
503,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know computers are a major part of our society. Ever since the first computer they have been improved so much, that now you dont even need a keyboard. Having computers benifits our society because it allows us to learn about technology, and how to memorize when we start to type a lot. You have an opportunity to learn about things you like. And @CAPS2 a plus you can communicate with people from all over the world. Every day you learn something new! Learn a lot now, and you will be better off down the road! That's all teachers say. We'll computers do just that. Computers can teach us! The more you use a computer the more you know about it. You can learn about how it's made and the vireses it can have. The computers can also teach you in a way you might never have thought of. When you sit at a computer and type you start to memorize where certin letters, numbers and punctuation are. Now you @MONTH1 ask what about the little kids? How do they learn from computers? They sell millions of games for kids to help them learn even before pre-school. In fact @PERCENT1 of all kids who start off playing educational games before entering pre-school are ahead. How great is that? Kids and adults both go on computers. For kids when they go on computers they are doing things they enjoy. For example my brother is really into parcore. Parcore is when a bunch of people do flips, off of buildings, walls, or anything they can find. When he goes on the computer he looks up different parcore tricks he can do or learn to do. For adults they use it for work. They to, might have to look up things for a meeting they might have, or a buisness that they might have to work with. Using computers could be fun for some and work for others. But eather way they are using computers ina way that can help them down the road. Communication is one of the main reasons people use computers. There is e-mail, @CAPS3, twitter, facebook, myspace, and so much more.If you were to ask ten randum people on the street and asked them if they have a facebook @PERCENT2 of them will say yes. Communication is key when it comes to buisnesses and relationships. For relationships like family and friends having a computer to talk from if they are far away is great. Even for buisnesess using those internet communications you can communicate to people if your going to be late. Computers have been and always will be a huge part in our society. The computers help us in ways like learning communication, and work, knowing that this technology can help us suesede is great.",9
504,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 you believe people spend way to much that on computers? In a survey @PERCENT1 out of @NUM1 of people rather go on the computer then take a walk in as parts. People who spend a lot of time on computers are lacking important things. For istance, they spend so much time on computer they have lose time to exerise, enjoy natue, and interact with friends and family. Computers have a negative effect on people. Many people don't excerise for only @NUM2 min. But when you are distracted on your computer aming or facebooking you forget to excrise or just go it for @NUM3 min. Because you want to get back to the computer. Computers on your desk starring at you and you sampled to go on. While, the yoga mat or weights sit on ground sterring at you too. However, the computers is mak fun and less woris. Therefore, your more willing to go on computer then excrise. Computers make it hand to excrise because your less into thinking how to this right and take you the because your thinking about a computer game, you played facebook, email and bunch more things on computer. So computers are unhealthy for people to have. Nature is beatiful, how the trees sway in the and butterflies fly in the air then there are all type of seasons with beatiful senery and. However there re stuffy room with sholves a desk and some picture that's the serey the people got when @MONTH1 are on the computer all the time. People are missing out on enjoying nature little and big beatities. People comuter aren't walking on beach on taking a nice long hike in woods dad not taking a stroll in a ark these are missing out on getting some fresh air and seeing the senery nature has to offer us. Instead they are sitting chair starring at a computer screen. However, pretty could that be compared to enjoying nature beatity? Computers are testing away people enjoying nature. Hanging-out with friends are family is a fun thing to @CAPS1 but how are you suppose to long out with them if your to the computer? They aren't going to internet with their friends or family. This could affect their future they could grow up sad and lonely aren't know how to act around people they get job their works around people. The people who are addicted to computer are missing out an doing something fun with some they lose or enjoy to be around. Computers could be people far away friends but how about instead call that friend on. They probably rather hear wire then. See a message so computers interesting with friends and family. Now, that you know how had the computers affect people you can understand why I'm computers. They cut in the peoples the excrise, and have people not enjoying nature. people want hang out with friends and famlies. So hopefully you can see what a bad affect computers have.",8
505,To the computers people technology is a good thing to have. If we do not have technology then we can not call no one. We wiil not have computers to go online. We can not talk to my family or friends. People us technology for they jobs like people that work for cars they need computers to see if the cars if old. That is why will need technology. People need technology for a lot of thin have technology to us. Computers is the big thing because we need to look up a lot of things online we need computers to test on. We call people with technology you us computers to go online on google.com that is why we need technology. so we can call people.,5
506,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think it's a good thing that people spend so much time on computers. One reason for this is when you type you learn hand-eye corrdination. Another reason computer time is a good time could be is it saves money on other things. The last reason is because you can do things in seconds on a computer that would normaly take hours. Hand-eye coordination is an importand thing: for example you're walking down the street when a baseball flys at you, your able to cach it because of all the time you have bin on the computer has taught you hand-eye coordination. Their are lots of ways to get it, like playing sports, writting, or just playing with your thumbs but learning to type is by far the best way because you'll use the skill while you'r a kids and an adult, @CAPS3 trouble paying your phone bill? Guss what you don't need a phone, why not use your computer to call people sensa its free. Also you wont really need a cell phone because you can do everything that can do quicker on a computer anwway. Last of all its harder for poeple to steel or you to lose a computer as to a cell phone. Have you ever got upset when treing to look for a peice of in formation in a book? Well you can be done with the hours of looking if you just use a computer, then you can get outside, and play games. Most of the time it takes me hours to do my homework, but is I had a computer it probly only take me minutes to do it. So for hand-eye coordination, having trouble with bills and it takeing to long to look thing up by other means I think its good that people spent and i hope you agree.",8
507,"I think that computers have positive effects on peole. People can find out important news online, and you can connect with people you don't see often. Also, you can order anything in the world online. These are three reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Computers inform people about important news. If there is a blizzard people can find out ahead of time and stock up on food. If there is a burglar going around, people can find out, and lock all doors and windows. And by knowing all this information, it helps helps people plan events, like birthday parites. Finding out important news is very helpful, and conveniant. And @PERCENT1 of people, are less to inconveniances, if they know the news. Another way computers have a positive effect on people is by allowing them to connect with people they don't see often. This provides an easy way to share events tha have taken place, and just have some time to talk face to face. With video chat, you can show off new , or newborn baby. You can share you want with people you barely see. Experts say that freindships last longer if you talk to each ohter often. and with computers, this is possible. A third way computers help out is allowing you to order anything in the world online. If you need a japanese doing for someone in ohio, you can order it online. If you're are old, and can't go to the grocery store anymore, you can order then online. I have seen that people who can order everything online, don't have to do a lot of driving, and this saves time, money, and gas. This is also very convendent and is less stressful then waithing in lines to purchase on item. These are just three ways htat computers have had a positive effect on people. the are that you can find out important news, you connect with people you don't see ofte, and you can order anything in the world that's why I believe comptuers have a positive effect on people.",8
508,"Have you ever wondered what life would be like without computers? Some experts are concerned that people are using too much time on the computers. I believe we should still use computers. Without a doubt using a computer helps us learn. The computer helps us learn about other places in the world. @PERCENT1 of people say they would love to look at beautiful places in the world. Computers also can teach you how to speak a language. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says that ""taking spanish online helped im a lot on her class. Computers now offer online study groups that can help us get into a college. Many people would agree that using a computer helps us learn new things. Its a fact that you instead other people on computers. You meet new people when you are in the computer. Most people live meeting other people online. You also learn social on the computer. @PERCENT2 of people say they learn social on the computer. People also can learn to have a personality because they in use. @PERSON2 says that ""because I got on the computer I didn't have the personality but I feel like a whole person. As you interact with people on the computers. Did you know that a computer teacher in life say if you need to use a computer in your will one already. @PERSON3 says that using a computer helped you type. Using a computer helped hand eye coordination. You type a lot of essays in college too os that can help you as well. So now you know that a computer helps you in the future. Without a doubt people should still use computers are helpful in many ways. So what are you waiting for go out and go your computer today!",9
509,"Dear local newspaper, I believe computers have a good effect on people. The reasons believe that is because the computer teaches us a lot of things, you can also find a relitive you have not seen in a long time. Two more reasons is because you could talk to your friends, another is you need it to put music on @NUM1's, @CAPS1's and other devices. My first reason I thought computers have a good effect on people was because it teaches us alot of things. If you wanted to know about a countries culture you will be able to go and find out on the computer. Without the computer you would have to visit not knowing what shot to take for sickness they have. Other things it could teach you is how to get from one place to another without stopping to ask people where a place is. It's important to know things on on the computer you can look it up and find out. Another is you can find a family member you haven't seen in along time. Being able to reconnect with someone is very important. What if something happened to them and you didn't know, like a broke leg or hip you can find out if you find them on the computer. Also alot of people @MONTH1 have family they miss and want to be close to or talk to again they cannot find them and fill close to them again. And they can find you if they relly need to talk to you. You could also talk to your friends in a chat room with other friends or alone. If you have moved far away the computer is a good way to keep in touch with your old friends. Talking to a friends releaves some kids of their stress they had. It helps when your friends make you laugh and talk to you about leaving everything alone and breath. Everyone has one friend that talks them out of doing bad things. A friend like that is helpful. Last reason is you need a computer to put music on your @NUM1 players. Music is very fun and alot of people love to listen to it. If you had no computers there would be no point in buying a lot of electronic devices because a lot you need the computer for. People like to listen to music on their @CAPS1 or @NUM1 while exercising but you need the computer to put music on it. Without computers their's no point of music. In conclusion I think computers have a good effect on people.",8
510,I think computers help people out because you can learn about at here thing like @CAPS1 you want a job you can look it up in the computers. Also @CAPS1 you have a problem they will help you out. @CAPS1 you what to go some where you could go and be on the computer and look how it is and @CAPS1 you like it you could go @CAPS1 not look some where else you what to go. I think it a great thing @CAPS1 you look for people in the computer because you could talk to them and see them it realy cool. You can look for coltures in your computer what you want to learn. Like @CAPS1 you have a favert person you what to know about you can look it up in the computer and she videos or you can look up different sites it really cool. There games you can play online there alot of game and fun game learning games. Math game science game different games you what. Also you can us othere people that are planing the game game as you. It realy cool. I think the computer isn't bad for people computer help them a lot.,6
511,"I think that people are spending a lot of time on there computers and not enjoying nature and things. My reasons are that people don't do anything except surf the web, talk to other people all the time, and they site around eating junk and no exercise. Those are my three reasons. My first reason is people do is surf the web. There is over a million websites to go to. What people do is go to all of them look at things or buy something. The only thing they should be doing is homework or buisness. Also people play to many video games on the computer too. My second reason is that people go on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or use web cams. Those people could be on there for hours talking to people. Sometime those things are peoples life and all they do. I know someone who has a @CAPS1 and after school all they do is talk to people. They have friends on @CAPS1 but no friends in real life. My third reason is when people do go on all they do is eat junk food and get no exercise. Sometimes they eat potato chips and cookies and have soda. If you do that for week you will be very tired and sleepy. Also you can get very fat. Your body will be unhealthy and out of shape. Now that you have read my reasons, I hope you like them. My reasons where people don't do anything but surf the web, talk to other people all the time, and people eat junk food and get no exercise.",7
512,"Dear Readers, I believe that spending time on the computer has its pros and cons. For the good things people are able to do research talk to people such as friends and family and also the computer can help you learn about anything you need to know about. I also think that there are some cons. People spend way to much time becomming distracted, you ignore your family without even knowing it and if you are just staring at a computer screen which can perminatly damage your eyes. I'm going to start with the good things about how computers have effects on people. The computer is great if you have to do research. If you need information on anything you can search it. Like if you have to do research on a certain project or subject the computer is the fastest way to get the information you need. Another good thing is that you have the capibility to talk to people such as friends and family. To me that is very important and I'm sure for you it is too. Thats what I believe a few of the good things are. Now, I'm going to talk about the bad things. I firmly believe that people are spending way too much time on the computer, without knowing how long has gone by! You just stare at the screen, which is not good for your eyes. It can perminatly damage them. One last thing I would like to mention, is that when you are on the computer they tend to ignore their friends and family which could be a big problem. These were just a few examples about how the computer has an effect on people.",7
513,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people? I personally think computers have a positive effect on people because with computers many people @CAPS1 research about the past. Also I don't agree that computers have a negative effect on anybody because with computers many people learn hand-eye coordinations, gives them the ability to learn about faraway people and places, they also allow people to talk to old friends or family members. Then, computers can also be used to help someone find information about nature such as different trees, plants, animals, and many other things that are involved in nature. After that, computers are also sometimes used to contact people who live faraway from you. Some ways to contact people on a computer are using e-mails, instant message, facebook, myspace, and many other websites. In addition, I think computers have a positive effect on people, but others maya not agree which is fine because not everybody has the same opinion on stuff in the world. Then, computers can be very useful to many people because they can use computers if they need to find information on history, any events that might have went on in the past that might not still be done in the present. Finally, computers are useful to scientists, business workers, many adults, and even children use computers if they need to type something for school or need to find information for a project they're doing.",8
514,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion @CAPS3 as to why some people support advances in technology belive that computers have a positive effect on people is that I disagree. Some people dont even get enough sleep if they stay up too late on computers. Also they spend less time exersizing and less time interacting with family and friends. Thos are @CAPS1 reasons as to why I disagree. In this paragraph I am going to tell you about why I think that people should @CAPS4 other things than going on the computer all night. If they wake up in the morning and start being grumpy dont blame them the computer had them stay up late. Would you rather get a good nights rest or be extra tired in the morning because you stayed up too late on the computer? Well once I stayed at @CAPS1 friends house and she was up on the computer all night she didnt even get any sleep. In the morning she was soo grumpy because she was soo tired. @CAPS1 languege arts teacher ""@PERSON1"" says that ""@CAPS2 up late on the computer all night isnt healthy because you get bugs under your eyes and youre sleepy.

(@CAPS3 the parents) @CAPS4 you realy want your kids to be lazy and on the computer all days or @CAPS4 you want your kids to excersize and get healthier? @CAPS1 friends kids always are on the computer everyday all the time and thats not verry healthy @CAPS3 them especialy because they're young. So a couple of weeks ago I talked to them about being active and how its not good to be on the computer alot. Now they bearly go on the computer they always are outside and playing and running around. @CAPS1 science teacher @PERSON3 says that ""@CAPS5 excersize is better than doing anything non active also it can be fun. @NUM2 out of @PERCENT2 of kids agree with @CAPS1 science teacher @PERSON2. In this paragraph I am going to explain to you why I think interacting with family and friends is better than on the computer. If you were in your familys shoes @CAPS4 you think that they would rather have you come hang out with them or be on the computer? When I was younger @CAPS1 family used to have to yell at me to get me off the computer so I could hang out with them but finaly a day come when I got to understand their family pain. @CAPS1 mom says that ""I should hang out with @CAPS1 family and friends more often."" @NUM3 out of @PERCENT3 of @CAPS1 family members and friends agree with @CAPS1 mom. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 conclusion I disagree with the statement ""Some people support advances and technology belive that computers have a positive effect on people."" @CAPS1 reason as @CAPS3 why is that people arent @CAPS5 enough sleep, less time excersizing, and less time interacting with friends and family.",9
515,"I think computers are good because if you need to remember stuff all you have to do is just look at there emeil and they will remember what thay have to do and also it is good if you is lost all you have to do is look at the map quickly. if you need to finish a school project you could do it in the computer looking for the websit of the project, if you need to cheek a websit about enythiny inportent you could just tipe the websit down and it will show up on the computer and if your child don't have nothing to do they could play games in cluding math games, @CAPS1 games, and also thay could look for nock nock jocks.",6
516,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 know, @CAPS2 people are starting to buy and own computers. Some experts say this is a bad thing and that we should spend more time outdoors. I disagree with this statement. First, computers help us with every day life. We check news on computers, some people even use their computers @CAPS1 a @CAPS3 and watch important shows. Second, a computer is a great way to comunicate. @CAPS10 its friends, family or even buisness, a computer is a excelent way of communication. finally, a computer is help when it comes to school or work. You could write a paper on the computer for example read on to see how I support my reasons of why computers are helpful in peoples lives. Have you ever had a time when you see something on the news that you want to learn more about? Well, @CAPS10 you had a computer, you could go online to the news website and read more. This is only one way a computer comes in handy in every day life, there are plenty more. Another way is @CAPS10 you don't own a @CAPS3, you could watch your favorite show on the computer. My english teacher @PERSON1 says ""I never owned a @CAPS3, I only watch @CAPS3 on my computer and I like it better"" In fact @PERCENT1 of people who watch videos on the computer like it better than @CAPS3. This is how computers come in handy in every day life. I love how computers have @CAPS2 ways of comunicating. I like it because I have @CAPS2 relatives who live far away and I use my computer to comunicate with them from time to time. Skype is my favorite, I can see the person @CAPS8 talking to at the same time. Also computers can be good for business for large companies who need to comunicate out of the contry. I'm sure being a amazing newspaper company, you could use a way of easy comunication. finally, comunication with friends. These are @CAPS2 programs for this, @CAPS9 @CAPS1 facebook and myspace. This is why a computer is a good way of comunication. finally, computers can be useful for schools and work. You can type a paper or news article on the computer. It's much faster than writing. Also, @CAPS10 you need more info on something, you could look it up online. like @CAPS10 you are writing an article on dolphins, you could learn more about them. In conclusion I think computers are good things. They help with everyday life, They are good for comunication. And last they help at school or work.",9
517,"Do you like learning about faraway exotic land and animals? Are you good at sports but would like to be even better? Do you ever miss your family that lives in other states? The computer can help you with all of this but is @CAPS1 bad for you too? In my opion kids and adults should use the computer. When people are on the computer they can learn about interesting far away lands. When your on the computer you can look up some of the natural disasters. For example people could google each quakes and learn all about the people that has lost their life's. The people that they will donate some money to the poor. Children living on their own. They can also learn about all the wonderful beautiful lands that are out their waiting to be explored. Everyone I know likes to the beutiful birds and animal. In their the world, They will be able to do this on computer. The might be so more this lands. Having a computer will also let you talk to people that are not easy to get. With having a computer people will be able to talk to their family that live in other states then them. I have a uncle that lives in @LOCATION1. I only get to see him because a lot of money to come. Somewhere on the computer, @CAPS1 is easy to just send him a message that say how I'm doing. With computer you will be able to talk to your friends cant talk on the phone. For example, what if your friend and did not. She can not talk phone because so what do you do you. This help you her. The last reason why we should have computer. If you let @MONTH1 periods of time then @CAPS1 will help you with hand eye coordination. This will help the kids that play baseball. They will know where the ball is at all times is they will most likely cauch the ball more often so playing a a little bit of video games is not bad for unless one. Using the computer is @CAPS1 good to do or not using the computer helps people be able to interact wild people that so easy to talk to. So @CAPS1 you are compleatly agenst using computer the get up and use @CAPS1 right now.",9
518,"Dear Readers, I understand some people are concerned that people spend too much time on the computer and that it is bad. I disagree, computers can help keep family members that live far away in touch. You can also see pictures of things that you cant see everyday. Finally, it helps your school work. I know a family that has a son fighting in the @LOCATION1. He brought his laptop with him so he was ask to video chat with his family. It seemed as though he never left. Without it, his family would wonder how he was and be worried. You don't have to have a family member at war to talk to them on the computer. Have you ever wanted to see what @LOCATION2 looks like? You don't have to travel there to find out. All you have to do is search it on your computer! If you live in a city with not a lot of nature in it, you can see what its like outside it with the computer. Seeing those sights @MONTH1 make you to travel, travelling with your family brings you closer. A study shows @PERCENT1 of families that go on vacations have strong relationships. Having a computer is mandatory for school. It is the best thing to research with. @PERCENT2 of students that are failing don't use a computer for homework. There are also websites that you can use for studying. There is a student in my school that failed most of his classes. He never used a computer. His friend suggested using one at home if he was having trouble, which he tries. He used a computer to help study for a test he had the next day. He ended up getting a @PERCENT1 on the test because he used a computer. It doesn't matter you using a computer for homework, talking with friends and familym or it is one of the most important inventions ever made.",8
519,"Dear @CAPS1, I belive that computers benefits the people of today. The invention of the computer had helped people to send messages and information to each other, helped students with school and allows children to have something to do when they can't go outside. Let me explain. The computer had created easier way for people to send messages and information to one and other. Before the invention of the computer, the only way to pass on information was by mail or phone. The computer sped up this process. In fact, people had recived information about @PERCENT1 faster with the invention of the computer. I was once able to send my friend an email about getting the homework faster than writing him a letter. Clearly, computers made it easier for people to comunicate with each other. Also, computers help students with school. Before the computer, a student had to use a type writer to type their papers. Using a typewriter, when they made mistakes which was on, they had to start all over. It;s a completely different story now. In fact, a study done by the board of ed. shows students write papers so faster and better with a computer rather than a typewriter. I remeber my grandfather told me about how he typed papers. It took him about an hour he typed papers. It took him about an hour and a half to write a paper on a typewriter, while the longest it took him was a half an hour on a computer. As you can see computers have helped students all across the . Lastly, computers supply kids with things to do while they can't go out side to enjoy nature. Many people would that kids would go on their computer when they were able to go outside. A study done by the @CAPS2-obesity shows that @PERCENT2 of kids would rather be outside playing and excersising than in their house on their computer. But sometimes, during certain weather conditions, kids aren't able to go outside, so they myt entertain themselves indeers. A study done by @ORGANIZATION1 shows that mere the @PERCENT3 of kids go on their computer when they can't be outside. If suddenly those kids lost their computer privleges, many of them will have little to entertain themselves with. Clearly, the computer occupies the time of kids who can't go outside. In conclusion, the computer has enormouse benifits on society. It allows people to send messages and information faster, helps students whith school, and gives kids something to do when they can't be outside. I hope that this letter had convinced you of the benefits of computers.",10
520,"Dear editor, I see that there is an argument between computers being good or bad. I think that my oppinon can help your decision. I think that computers are good. I think they are good because they help kids with social skills, they help people with bad handwriting and they help people learn about things around the world. First of all computers help kids all around the world with social skills. They help them because these is so many ways to communicate with people through the computer. There is instant messaging and webcaming websites. Also a servey said that @PERCENT1 of parents say that the computer raised there kids social skills a lot. Another thing the computer helps with is people with bad handwriting. It helps because you can go on microsoft word and instead of writeing a great report that no one can read you can type I that when I have a paper for school that neatness counts on I always up my report. This can help alot of people who cant write as well as others because on the computer you change the font and everything to make it look as nice as you want. The last reason I think the computer is a good idea is because alot of people dont like to read newspapers and watch the news so they like to research certian subjects they like, to know whats going on around who world. I know my mom doesn't have time to watch the newest the newspaper but when she checks her email the first thing that pops up is the bigest news of the day. People all around the work go so the computer to find of the latest news. I hope you consider my oppinon when you make you decison, where you go think of all the kinds of people it helps. People with social problems, people with bad handwriting, and just busy people who cant sit down and watch the hour news. Thank you for your time.",8
521,"Dear Local Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1 has been a discussion around the @LOCATION1 for decades now. People cannot agree on whether computers are a good privelage to the society or just bumping it down year after year. I think computers do have a positive effect on people. This is because they teach hand-eye coordination, give them knowlege about cultures around the world, and allow people to communicate with one another. Do you think the downsides really outweigh these positives? Hand-eye coordination is not something you are born with. You gain it as you get older and acheive practive. Computers help with this goal. ""@PERCENT1 of people who go on the @ORGANIZATION1 frequently, have been horrible at catching a baseball before going on the @ORGANIZATION1, and after have caught every time."" says biologist @PERSON1. And it not only helps with baseball, but with other sports such as juggling, golf or tennis. If you get very good at these sports, you can play them for fun, or even as a proffessional. Who knew that playing on the @ORGANIZATION1 could get you so far in life?! Did you know, according to ""Time"" magazine, that people who go on the @ORGANIZATION1 are better able to focus on tasks, such as schoolwork, because it enables your hands and eyes to work together as one? And everyone knows that if you get good grades in school, almost any job you could be qualified in? Then, you can earn a good amount of money, and live your dream life!! Oh, great another @NUM1 hour day of school. Hhmm. What do I have first block? @LOCATION3 history. What? Yes! We're doing a culture project! That means I can easily go on the @ORGANIZATION1 and find out great things about what place I'm assigned. That's another up-put about computers. Easy access to tons of useful information. I have cheerleading everyday after school until @NUM2. If I have a project, I don't have hours and hours to look in books and find out what I need to know. Computers allow me to do my sport and still get a good grade in school. @PERCENT2 of people use computers to do their informational work about faraway places. It is faster and more accurate. You could just search through your bookshelf to find an almanac. But once you find it, you would need to check the copyright. Hopefully it's recent. If not, you're in trouble. Would you feel like prying through more shelves to be acccurate? Facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2. All new ways to communicate with people. Just another useful effect on people. Forgot to write down your homework? Hopefully your friend didn't and you can just ask them. ""@PERCENT3 of people don't chat with others online."" says @LOCATION2 @ORGANIZATION1 expert. Most of it has to be for some reason or another. Such as homework, what happened that day, or how they haven't seen eachother in forever. Don't you chat with people online? Trust me, it can be a gradesaver. Maybe this will help you conclude that computers give a positive effect on society because of handeye coordination, information, and chatting. What would we do without them?",10
522,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that being on the computer too long is bad for people because, you could get obsessed with the computer. You could get in trouble, and it could effect your education. One reason I think that being on the computer too long is bad for people is because you could get obsessed with it. For example, if you were playing outside on a nice day and you called a friend and asked them to come over and they said no I can't @CAPS3 on the computer. You said why todays a nice day. Then your friend said @CAPS3 playing games. Thats an example of being obsessed with a computer. Another reason that being on the computer too long is bad for you is because you could get in trouble. Getting in trouble online is bad because you could get sued or the owner of the website could delete it from your computer. Also if your parents found out you would be in even more trouble because then you would get grounded. That means you wouldnt be able to use the computer for a long time. My last reason that being on the computer too long is bad for you is because it could effect your education. If someone was on the computer too long instead of doing their homework that could effect their grades a lot. If you are in @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and this happens you wouldnt be alowd to graduate and go to college. That is not a good thing if you are trying to get into a good college. Even though the computers is important in @CAPS5 @CAPS6 you still shouldn't be on it to long. In conclusion everything I have said about why being on the computer too long is bad for you proves that too much computer is bad for people.",8
523,"There are many great things about computers. If we were to loose them then our lives would change dramatily. You can use computers for exercise then it is also up to the @CAPS3 on limits. Last it can save lives Computers are great, if we were to loose them. There would be no more internet. you would't be able to talk to friends on @CAPS1 or e-mail. Cell phone prices would go through the roof. We would technacly be going back @NUM1 to @NUM2 years. Last with out computers there would be more diffeculty in large companies Computers can help exercise. One way is we can find closest gyms on the internet. We can find what is healthy to eat right away You can also get one of those @CAPS2 fits for a computer. Also you can find free work out videos. Next, it should be up to the @CAPS3. It is their discretion if they see that the child is spending to much time on the comuter and gaining weight they can easaly limit it. they can say for very hour your on the computer you have to do an hour of exercise. Lastly the computer can save lives. Before computers medicine like tylonal was used for everything. Stuffy nose, headache, cold etc. Now we can go on the computer to find weather the medication is at all dangerous. You can also find the nearest hospital. Finally, computers can do a lot of good, even though it can make less unhealthy if you spend to much time on it it can save your life. It can also destroy companies and our lives, @CAPS3 can give limits and computers can used to exercise. So reading this essay please don't take away our computer",8
524,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 some beleive computers do not benefil society, I do. Computers help buisnesses thrive, keep people people aware of what is going on in the world, and allow people to stay in touch with each other. Computers greatly benefit small and large buisnesses across the world. Imagine all the jobs at each buisnesses without a computer. Buisnesses would be unreliable because no instant contact would mean it might take a long time for products to be assembled and shipped. Any buisness owner would cringe at the idea of running of buisness without a computer. When surveyed, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 buisness owners and workers would prefer a computers assistance at work. Almost every modern day buisness relies on at least one computer. For example, companies that mass - produce their products often rely on computers to do jobs more precisely than a worker. Sometimes computer operated robots do dangerous jobs so workers are not at risk. Buisness also need computers to quickly recieve and send information to other buisnesses and people. Buisnesses are not the only need for computers. People use computers as much if not more, than buisnesses. People like you and me use computers to keep in touch with friend and people we know. Thanks to websites like @CAPS2 and e-mail people can easily stay in touch. Families use computers to plan get-togethers. Friends use computers to keep contact after grade school or if they do not live nearby. With computers, anyone that is anywhere can be in constant contact with anyone else. People also like to know news imediately. Without computers it would be alot harder to contact the rest of the world. Imagine a natural disaster accuring and not knowing about it right away. In that case we could not send aid to the area. With the recent earthquakes in @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2. Knowledge about the rest of the world is even more important. Newspapers provide news and information but a day or two late and they often use computers to aquire that information. Eighty-seven percent of scientists agree that recieving information would be a lot harder.",9
525,"Dear local Newspaper, I think using a computer has become bad influence on modern society. When people talk to each other via text message or e-mail there is no emotional sense. You are blind a way because you can't see who's on the other side of the screen, @CAPS1 you know is the username of that person. Its practically the same as using a disguise. Not only is the computer dad for your healthy. Its become a threat to its user. Would you really want to use something that bad toward your health and your privacy? Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of teenangers have access to/and use the internet more than three times a week. Statistics also so that more than half of teenagers in the @CAPS2.S.A spend more than @NUM1 hours on a computers, some even @NUM2 hours! This has become the addiction of the world. My friend barely used a computer and always played outside. When his sister showed him @CAPS3, @CAPS4, myspace, @CAPS5, etc. He would stay on for hours and after a month, it didn't get better, day after day he began to come outside less and less, and I began to hate him fo that. Statistics show that people who are using computers excessively tend to have drop in their grades. People are mixed in to these machines they become anti-social, don't do homework, potentially fail the unit and reappeat the grade. Computers are the same as watching tv, sure! they teach hand to eye coordination but at the same time their brains are being turned into swiss cheese. I believe computers are the best idea, since pouring gasoline on pancakes. ",8
526,"Dear local newspaper, I agree that computers benefit us totaly. This lets people explore the world and do anything. Also, computers are used for many things. Last but not least @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 households have at least one computer. So computers lets us do anything and everything. It helps most people with their jobs, college/school, and you can even buy a house or car online. It doesn't cost that much and its very usefull. You can look up facts you need or even play games when your bored. It keeps us in touch with the world. Also, many thing require a computer. For example, In order to play xbox live you need a computer with @CAPS1. Xbox live lets you play video games with other people or even your friends. Some homework requires computers and some colleges are only on the computer so you can stay at home. Anything you need you can find it on the computer. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 house hold have computers, or @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 does. I agree that some people waste their time, but without computers everything would be much harder. For example, say you need to having to wait @NUM5 days for the mail. Just @CAPS2-mail it. Most people wouldn't have a job if it weren't for computers. It saves peoples time and lets them do other things except have to drive somewhere to give a letter to them. So I think computers are a huge benefit. Like I said you can do anything. Like @CAPS3. It keeps you in touch with friends if your on vacation from school. They are also used for several different things like downloading music on your @CAPS4. Also, @CAPS5 everyone has a computer. If scientists are going to complain about computers than why do they use them? I think computers are great! But whats you opinion?",8
527,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are not necessary. Some believe that they help us learn, but I just say so do books. Some people believe @CAPS2 can help to be more hand eye coordinated, so does playing catch. Most believe that internet teaches about people in faraway places, I say why not visit those places then you'll know more than what was typed in a computer. @CAPS2 it was computers against books I definetly would conqure with whomever roots for books. A good book is healthy. To me, reading a book on the computer is one of two things, unhealthy and unethnical! You can't read a book on the computer and even @CAPS2 you could it is not as fun as turning the pages of a beautiful paperback or hard-covered book. I Believe that you can learn so much from what you read in a book, (A real book)! When you type on a computer, do all that, ""clickety, clickety""!, you say that it's learning because you learn to type without looking, hand-eye coordination. I say no! that is not natural. Why not go out side and throw a ball to one another? That's a real way to show hand-eye coordination. It's a fun game and it's easy, plus it teaches hand-eye coordination. When you want to surf the web to find a nice vacation spot, you should really just visit that place. Flip a coin heads @LOCATION3 tails @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 you pick heads, stop surfing the web to get info on that place!. go fly there and surf the totaly radical waves. Surf the real waves next the artificial ones dudes! So as I restate, computers might seem okay and i guess they aren't all bad, but they are not my cup of coffee. So take time away from that computer and go read a book or play a game of catch. You know what hows about a trip to @LOCATION4 or @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION3. Who knows, it will definetly be an experience, for sure.",9
528,"Yes, I agree with the concern that expert have. I say this because its true people get on the computer for a long time and forget about their family, there is also all kinds of danger online, and lastly your brain is not getting enough work out. Don't you think all of this is true? Well, then if you still don't believe me I'll prove it to you. First, people get addicted to the computer they forget about there family. Insted of beign on the computer just looking for stuff like myspace or facebook, but they should spend time with their families playing games like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3. I say this from a personal expirience, it wasn't me it was my cousin @PERSON1 he got addicted to the computer so much that everytime his family tried to do something fun together they would always end up fighting because he didn't want to go. Secondly, people can be facing major danger online, for example when you got to those chat sessions where you meet people supposley your age, but it might not always be that way everytime on the news you see stories where old people try act like @NUM1 year olds, but they aren't they just want to do bad stuff. So you can be facing a lot of dangerd online. Lastly, by beign on the computer your not letting your brain get the good workout or exersice it needs. Your just letting it be there, but instead you can be reading a book or do a word seach puzzle; these are all good idea for making your brain exersice. On a recent research experts say that people spend time reading and exersicing their brains do very good on test, but people who spend most of the time in the computer fail test. So don't you think I'm right? Don't you think that if you spend to much time on a computer you have less time with your family. You can be facing serious danger, and your brain is not getting the exercise it needs. Did I convinced you yet?",8
529,"People often say that computers and technology are bad for you, but yet i think they have helped our society out very well. Computers help people through there trouble. Computers make our lives easier. By, when you buy things now there are computers adding and subtracting your amounts, They help people find out where to go, And last but not least they help friends and family stay in tuch with each other. With out computers we would have to wait in longer lines for what we want to buy. For instince stop & shop they have computers to check out people and the lines are already long enough. If we had no computers the lines would be even longer because then the people would have to add up the money by hand. Also with out computers you would not be able to weigh you good as fast as we do now in grosery stores we would have to hand weigh it. With out computer days at the grorsury stores would be very long. Without computers you would not have @CAPS1 and places online that give you directions. You would have to have use the bid maps driving to places. Those mapes could get lost wile you are driving. You can lose yout spot, And some times you @MONTH1 mark out the wrong spots on you map. With computers you can have @CAPS1, Online directions that can tell you the fastest and easest way to get to your place. Also with computers it saves papers on maps and we do not wast as much trees. Have you ever been in the situation were you want to go visit your family member out of state but you just dont have the money? well many people have and now insted of waisting (the money they dont have). They can video chat, talk, look at peoples pitchers and keep updated with them on the computer. You do not need to spend tons of money on it, it is all free, they are social networking sites. That people use to keep in tuch with family and friends. Those sites you have to use on. the computer so with out computers you would have to travel in a car waste money and the air with your car. In conclution i think computers have helped out society out very well!!!",8
530,"Dear newspaper editor: @CAPS1 are all living in the age of technology. There are many useful devices that help us live our every day lives. The computer is a major help. @CAPS1 can talk with relitives from different areas and you can surf the internet to learn new information. @CAPS4 you can playing games with people from ground the world. The computer is a great divice. Almost everyone has a relitive that lives in another state or country. Well you never see them because they live far away right? With a computrer you can talk and even have a face to face conversation with them. @CAPS2 can bring your family closer together. For example, my family just got a new computer and @CAPS1 have relitives that live in florida that @CAPS1 almost never see. With the computer my dad talks to them almost everyday. Some people that I have talked to said that ther are excited to see their relitives or friends more often. @CAPS2 has brought them closer together and made them better friends. The internet is a wonder place where you can look up information for a school project and learn about different topics. When kids are doing a project in school and the information they need is not in the class book they can search @CAPS2 and @CAPS2 saves time. @PERCENT1 of kids said that when they are doing a project the best thing to use would be the internet. @CAPS4 @CAPS2 helps the kids work faster so they can spend more time outside or hanging out with their friends. Another thing you can do is learn about recent events. For example most local newspaper have a website that you can visit. Even if you local does not you can go to other websites like ""@CAPS3"". They have recent events that happen around the country and around the world. The internet is useful in many ways and can help you with your every day life. Every kid gets bored when its a rainy day. So they can play games with people from around the world using a computer. The are many websites that have fun games that are fun and enjoyabal. You can @CAPS4 become with people from other contrys. My friends @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 play the computer and they have alot of friends from other contrys. I think that its cool that you are playing the exact game with another. Person in @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2, @CAPS4 most of the games are safe and fun to play. Another thing is that you can connect and play with your friends in your home town. I have many times playes games with @PERSON1 and @PERSON2. @CAPS2's a fun thing to do during a boring, rainy day. In conclusion, the computer is a useful divice thats benefits us and helps us with our everyday life. @CAPS2 allows us to connect with family in far away places and surf the internet for new information. @CAPS4 you can play games with people from around the world. Its a wonderful divice and lets start using @CAPS2. ",10
531,"I think using the computer is great. You should heed my advice, people should be useing computers. Computers are an exelent way to comunicate. People can connect with others from all over the world. My dad moved to brazil so we have ben communicating via, @CAPS1-mail, @CAPS2, and even facebook. It’s the easyest and cheapest way to comunicate. If I call someone from a different country it would cost me way more but if I send them an @CAPS1-mail it’s cheaper. Studys from the university of @LOCATION1 show that @PERCENT1 people think its easyer and to use a computer to comunicate. More over you can do it instantly so it gets the information anywhere in milliseconds. Computers are indeed the best way to comunicate. Another thing computers are used I for as learning. Many people from around the world have learned diffrent languages from wed sites or programs that have great instruction and lessons. I learned to play guitar with maney programs and online lessons. Maney people depend on computers to get information and learn about things. My mom is a secretary at an inseurens broker companey. Without computers the coustemers couldn’t learn about the diffren policeys that there are and they misth be spending more money then needed on insearence. With out computer scientests couldn’t do much reasarch or learn about plants or rocks. Computers make it easyer for them to study and learn about @LOCATION2 and everything. Doctors wouldn’t be adel to do half of the thing they can with out a computer. They learn about diffrent sicknesses and broken bones by useing computers. @PERSON2 said she couldn’t be able to help out as many people with out the use and help of a computer she states that she learned @PERCENT2 of what she knows from websites that have in formation about the humin body. Even teachers say that they set better teaching skills from web sites. Builder and modern desiner @PERSON1 says he learned about different building designes that are sturdyer and stronge shapse he used this in his building today.

532,"Dear local newspaper, Technology is an important part of everyday living even some people's lifestyle without technology, more specifically, computers, mankind would be lost. We wouldn't be able to learn about faraway places and people research things with a wider range of information available or for some people, talk to friends and family. Technology i needed in everyone's life they realize this or not. There is an endless amount of things you can do on the computer and as far as advances in technology this is only the beginning. The internet allows people to learn-and more than just what you would get from a book at the library. You can learn about the culture of @LOCATION1, the food they eat in @LOCATION2, or even the way people dress in @LOCATION3. You can find pictures and of faraway places and find out the currency or of a country. The possibilities @CAPS1 computer allow you to do is research. When maybe they through them giving a presentation much easier! Furthermore the computer enables people to comunicate with others. For some, this is their only way of communication. If you have a penpal in @CAPS1 state, or maybe even @CAPS1 country, e-mail is a great way to talk to them it's quick, easy, and enjoyable tool others, however, prefer instant messaging - the message you type pops up almost instantly on the others computer. Then they type a response and it comes back to you! Either method is a great way of communication! So you see, without technology we would not be able to learn everything we'd like to, research for, say on for language arts class. We not even be able to communicate with some others. And this is only the beginning of what our lives would like without the computer.",8
533,"What I think about computers benifiting our community is great. Tecenology has gone far over the years. The most important is the computer. Most schools have computers. The reason is that benefits society. They are a hudge save in paper. You also learn more thing about place @CAPS1 any thing. These reasons support why we need to have computers. Computers benifits our community by saving paper. It also make our work neater. We can talk to friends and familys. The main reason is that it give computer technians more jobs people need more jobs computer also provide news. say The mayor need to send and iportant message about polluting the water he can do that through email. The main thing today in our society is going green. The only way we can do that is by swiching to computers. We have to chop so many trees down just to get @NUM1 paper to each kid in the grade. Aduts should understand we need to conserve paper. Now I know what your thinking what of we need to print something. My response is that you just could email it to a teach friend or any body else. Kids these day need to learn more about other cultures. We need to know what there econimy. The fastes what we could do that is internet. It is so much faster than looking through thousands of books. All you have to do is type the place you want and boom there it is. There are many benefits to having a computer my final reason is it also give you great hand I cordination. And if you want to be a athe lite than you need lots of it. How the computer gives you hand I coordination is from typeing an moving the mouse. The best way is to play lots of education video games. Whith all the facts and statement I gave you like benifiting community, going green and also learn about other place. Please when you are writing you article before and listen to my facts.",8
534,"More and more people use computers everyday. Computers are a great help for projects, email, vacation spots, and so on. However, some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer instead of excercising, or taking a walk. I think that computers are an important part of a persons life because the information found on a computer is very useful. It can be useful to you when you have a report coming up. What if your teacher tells you that a report is due tomorrow? What are you going to do, you don't have time to go to the library. I would go on the computer and get all the information I need. I would also use a computer to learn about far away places, or even famous people in history. I also could look up where I'm going on vacation and then I could learn more information about it. Like, you could find where the best resturant locations are, the best holers, and even the best tourist spots. Computers are also helpful for chating. My grandparents moved so I don't talk to them that much anymore, but since I have a computer I can send a quick e-mail saying hi, or asking how they're doing. Also imagine going to work and not having a computer! Thats a lot of work to write down! At some works, the work consists of emailing other work members about the problems they are having, and about meetings. By using a computer you can keep up to date on everything thats going on. Also computers are helpful because if you had a test to study for, and you forgot your notes at school, you can look up online what you are studying. Then you can study from the computer. So then the next day you won't fail the science test. Computers can be a nice little break after all your homework is done. If you want to go on the computer to talk to your friends, it should be an insentive to get all your homework done first. Sometimes people need some down time after all their homework is over with. Playing games on the computer can be a nice way to relax. Computers are a great help for reports, vacations, chatting, information to help you study for a test. Also to play games on. A lot of people use computers to do work on for their jobs. I think computers are an important part of a persons daily life.",8
535,"I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. All these things are good so why not use computers, we need computers. Do you think computers are a positive effect or a negative effect? After you hear this you might want agree with computers have a positive effect. Computers have a positive effect in so many ways for example: school, work, talk to other, and just get information. From different websites. If we did not have computers or use them we would probably use books. We would get information from the books but not as much as we would get from the computer. We probably would not know that much if it wasn't ofr computers. The reason why computers have a positive effect is because you work your eyes and while you are typing you are exercising your hands. That proves hand-eye coordination. We learn about places we don't live in like that? Had a earthquake we went on websites for that. You get to learn how it is in a certain place you want to go on vacation for. You get to learn about famous people you do not know about so all you have to do is go on the computer and look up your celebrity. Computer is something people use to talk to people and keep in contact. Now we have @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and others. We use that to talk to our friend and family. Some of our family or friends live in far away places so we use the computer to talk. If you have a e-mail teachers and people at work might have to e-mail each other to handle business. You can even get work for students at school so that way the can learn more and do different activities. You can even play games on the computer. You can explore nature on the computer. I think computer is a great way to learn and talk with others. Do you want your child to learn? Do you want your child to have fun? So tell me what you think! Computers have a positive effect.",8
536,"Dear Newspaper, In my opinion, I think computers do benefit society. One reason is because people can learn about new things, it makes life a little easier then it is, and lastly, people can meet new people while they're on the computer. First off, we can benefit from computers because we can learn new things. People can find places that they've never heard of, or they can see whats going on in the world. Computers can help kids that are in school who want to learn new things. Computers help you find out important information that you might need to know in the future. Secondly, having computers in our society can make life a little easier for some people. On computers, you can order things from online websites instead of trying to go out and buy them. For people with no transportation, this'll help make their lives a little easier than it is. Or, for example, if a person wants to buy something that isn't in stores yet, they can go online, and they might have it up there. Lastly, having computers can help you meet new people. If someone just moved from another town or state, this will help them meet new people. Or if a student doesn't know anybody from their new school, they might find them online and then they'll be able to get to know each other. In conclusion, computers help our society in a lot of ways. They can help us learn new things, we all can meet new people. and computers can make our live s a little easier. Thats whay I think we should keep computers in our society.",8
537,"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think people need to see the realatey from computer's and the real world, they're a lot of people spending to much time on the computer and not spending enough time with there familys or doing things that are really important. While your on the computer your not getting any exsercise your not getting stronger your just sitting down. Thats one of the ways people get fat because there not moveing around just sitting down. When your on the computer all day everyday your missing out on whats happening with your family you miss out on every thing that's going on. I think people need to relax on spending time on the computer and get some exsercise or call one of your cousins brothers or even your mon and find out what really up because they are the ones that really matter! But you really can't tell people how long there allowed to spend on the computer you can only give an opinon and hope they listen.",6
538,"Dear @CAPS1, I remember when I was younger my parents got two laptops for themselves. Internet use was always available, interaction of online chat. It was extremly exciting for them. On the other hand, I got to sit home and watch them have fun. I couldn't go outside, or hang out with friends just because I was stranded insided as they enjoyed the computer. I strongly feel as if computers do not benefit society. People spend too much time using the internet than exercising, nobody gets to enjoy the beauty of nature, and there is less interaction with family and friends. There are many holes being dog while computers one still being used and bought. Our society is just going downhill from here. People don't need to be sitting at home inside breathing reused air while using the computer. Proffessor @PERSON3, a health generalist, stated on @ORGANIZATION2 news that @PERCENT1 of all people around @LOCATION1 would rather be on the computer at home doing nothing than going outside and/or getting some kind of exercise. Could you imagine all of those unhealthy people not worriying about anything except their computer? the only thing computers do for us these days is abandon our free time. @CAPS2 waist @PERCENT2 of there spare time on their computer. If technology decreases there new games people play, and sites people use, it is likey for people to get out of the house and do something healthy for themselves. @PERSON1, owner of @ORGANIZATION1, said ""I have never seen in my entire life, so many people using there computers and internet. Its been quite sometimes when over one billion @CAPS2 are online on a typical weekend. "" @PERSON1 later mentions "" it's kind of depressing of how much time they spend on computers, than outside and enjoying nature."" Not only is excersicing time headed down the drain, but our used to be "" beautiful"" nature is as well. Many young kids these days are watching @CAPS3, they see computer game commercials there parents buy them the game, and all of a sudden they are on it @NUM1. Since adults aren't doing there part by idolizing these kids to persuade them to run around outside and do something healthy. The kids need to step up for a change! Did you know global warming is caused by the minimum density in the air? If we have almost to no children or adults running around outside, our world is not flowing too well. Hence our budget is low, and pollution is extremly off the wall; our nature is going from beatifu to less and lesser. @PERSON2, a government official has survey @NUM2 people from each state asking about how much time they spend weekly of just enjoying nature and roleizing the beaty of it. The survey reads one in every @NUM3 people thoughly breathe in the beauty for at least @NUM4 minuests, a week. I mean come on; that's pathetic. Maybe if we surely excluded computers and technology for a while, global warming won't be nessicary. I remember when I was about @NUM4 years old an I never once got to meet my other family besides my siblings. It was pretty sad because I'm always told I have a huge family that is very known to our town but I have no clue who they are ! this is all because technology was invented. Never once have I ever been outside and relaxed besides when I got on and off the bus for school. My parents stand me in my house as they use the computer. The other day I just found out what ""show"" is because my moms computer brake and now I am get introduced to my other family along with the freedom of going outside. Ever since my mom's computer brake she has lots of free time to spend with me. Technology ruined my childhood as a kid and without it you get to open up the real importance of life. Would you want to become obese, like through global warming, and/or to not interact with family or outside nature? Its sadi how @PERCENT3 of these reasonings are caused by the excessvive use of technology and computers. Let's just get rid of it all! Thank you for your time @CAPS1!",11
539,"Dear local newspaper, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students at @ORGANIZATION1 say that they spend most of their time on the computer. I think computers have a bad effect on people because they can cause safety issues, health issues, and ofcourse education issues. With all this new technology, teenagers aren't aware of their surroundings at all. On top of that, they're not aware of what's happening to them. Adults also do use the computer, but not as frequent as us teenagers. It's time now to realize what computers are doing to us and the world today. Computers can cause safety issues. Now more than ever people use where they talk to friends. But, what they don't know is that the person on the other side might not be what they think it is. Lately, on the news we hear of teenagers getting raped or kidnapped because of people who they were talking on the internet was not who they said they were. Bad people are always lurking on the internet, and we need to prevent them from getting in contact with the kids. But, even besides having bad people online, computers can with your privacy. It's possible for computers to give out your information to other people so, we really need to watch out. Computers though not only cause safety issues, but health issues also. Computers play a major part in destroying our health. About @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are overweight or obese. T.V's use to be the issue for people not excercising, but now computers are doing just the same. There are so many things to do on the computer that just doesn't make you bored. That there means that there is no way to from it. But, you need to get up and exercise and computers are preventing people from doing so. It's like it's hypnotizing us because we simply don't want to get up. Computers can also have an impact with your vision. I know that after a long time on the computer I have a massive headache because my eyes just hurt so bad. Also, computers can make people stop talking to each other verbally. Talking and interacting makes us have safe relationships with one another, but computers again are preventing this. Besides interfering with our computers do the same with education. Computers can really be bad with our education. Students now easily forget to do homework. There are so many distractions today that than of them whom people spend a long time on it, we forget to do other things that we're suppose to do simply becausewe're distracted. But, eventhough we forget our homework, we also @MONTH1 forget to study before a test. This would result in a in high grades. Computers shouldn't be distracting people, but instead helping them. I think it's not the people to not get distracted on the computer because it just has so many interesting features. For example, the internet, and websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, etc. We have so many distractions in our that we don't need more! Computers really don't have a good effect on people. More and more people get computers everyday. They should know what its doing to them, and what's happening to the world around them go outside and enjoy nature? Maybe, go to the mall with friends and. There are a variety of things to do rather than staying glued to the computer the whole day. People need to stop being and open their eyes to see the effect computers have on people.",11
540,"I tink that a computer is a good idea because when people are online they like to talk to there family and see them by the video cam. When you dont want to go out or your just go online and pay us .

541,"Dear @CAPS1, Technology has been advancing at a rapid rate for many years now making life much easier for everyday people. It helps out in many ways for example, to keep in touch with relatives, to learn new information and to keep you safe and updated. Computers are vital to everyday life and we need them. A huge purpose of computers is to keep in touch. With new programs like ""@CAPS2"" and ""@CAPS3"" and ""@CAPS4"", it leaves you with all sorts of new opportunities to keep in touch and have fun with your friends that were not previously available. Email as well, is a great taol to keep in touch with family that are far away opposed to the good'ol letter which @MONTH1 take a web in the mail. Another huge reason why we need computers today is to be able to reaserch foreign places and learn facts that without a computer you would never even heard of. With computers, it makes it possible to go online, look up the @ORGANIZATION1, research it and plan a flight there a week later. It is also a great tool to learn new things that he did not know previusly. It is a huge step up in the education process. Computers also provide us with extreme saftey and security as well as breaking news. Imagine how much simpler it would be to be able to be at home and go on the computer to check the best rout home opposed not and consequently sitting intinse. With modern day technology all that is possible. They add great saftey and protection to average people like you and me. In conclusions, hopefully your mind has been changed on the topic of computers, or if you already were in support, that as well is great. Now you are being asked to spread the word about how great computers are and how vital they are to ensuring a better future. I understand that some people do not enjoy electronics but it is up to you to set them straight! Computer save great tools for moving ahead and we should cheer, as them, not trash them.",8
542,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think Computers have a bad effect on people for three reasons. One they can really hurt your eyes, two it is not safe if you have little kids in your house. Finaully three you will never see your family or friends if your on the computer. The first reason was computers have a bad effect on people is it can really hurt your eyes. If your always stareing at a computer screen all the time you can go blind. And with you having bad eyes you can get serious head injures just from hurting your eyes. The second reason why computers have a bad affects on people it is not safe if you have little kids in your home. Like you can be watching adult movie that little kids are'nt aged enough to see if can have a bad effect And it has a bad effect on people because you will have no and if you have a little kid in your house he will always be in and he will probaly hear something really, really kid like music, @CAPS3 if you have a kid house The reason was computers have bad effects on people is that if your always on a computer you will never see your family and @CAPS3 if you are always on the computers you will miss out on the And will never you never see and don't @CAPS3 a rent on on the computers. @CAPS3 what you look And keep the little kid with you in the house. And last get off the computer and go see your family and friends. ",8
543,"Did you know that in a recent poll in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 use computers everyday? Computers have a very positive effect on people, such as informing them on news, traffic, and weather right away, interacting with others, and learning new facts. Can you even imagine how difficult life would be without computers? They are a daily tool that millions of people use positively. One way that people use computers positively is by using it to be informed by news, traffic, and weather. For example, say there are signs of a hurricane going to hit near their homes. they would know righ away just by clicking on the internet. Another example is if there was a shooting nearby. People would be well aware of the facts by reading an article online. Computers help by informing people about danger so they and their families are not harmed not only doe computers help inform people about any danger through news and weather, but @CAPS4 their daily lifestyle. My father drives into work every morning, and is always looking online for any traffic updates so he can avoid them and get to work on time and safely, without computers people would be unable to know directly the harms and difficulties they @MONTH1 face. Another positive affect computers have on people, is letting them interact with others, such as video chatting and instant messaging @PERCENT2 of the world video chats and instant messages. It helps to make people more social, by chatting with their friends. Another example is, say you haven't seen a close family member or friend in a long time. Video chatting and instant messaging will help you catch up and develop a stronger realationship nobody wants to waste time in life not speaking for a long period of time to a close friend or family member, right? Computers help people by interacting with others throughout their daily lifestyle. A third positive effect computers have on people is teaching them new things. Students' main source for education is through the computer on the internet. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""Computers are what helps my students grow. I have them use computers everyday for reports and to extend their learning"". They are @CAPS4 helpful to students because the internet now contains textbooks they use in class. That way, the won't need to lug around heavy books, and strss out for forgetting them, @CAPS4, if the student doesn't understand material learned in class, they can look online for extra help and guidance, malking their knowledge grow further. Without computers, lives wouldn't be the same in a negative way. Computers help people know news, traffic weather directly, interact with people, and learn new things. therefore, computers are very positive, since @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 use them now positively, why stop?",9
544,"I think that people shouldnt use the computer's that much because it make's you want to be on it and on it day. Like yea you can play games on it and talk to people like other people you use of lec see I can understand that but the other people around you like that live's with you people that on the computer all day can spend time with there family and friends and to other places then going to look at them on the computer's I mean like to see other people that you see on the computer like chat or like webcam on the computer, you can maybe go see in a other state and go visited them. then being on the computer people that always on the computer should get out because there never going to do things is they are always on the computer, like when @CAPS1 on the computer @CAPS1 on it for a hour are so the I do things with family and friends, but not all the time that @CAPS1 on it, like i understand if you work on the computer at work and then finishing things at home for your work, but once in a you get to spend some time with family and friends, not @CAPS4 be on it all the time. Some people @CAPS4 come home and @CAPS4 go on the computer and that how people get lazy the start getting fat because they @CAPS4 go on the it and maybe stop to eat and back on the computer, then when they get off of it they will eb all tierd and stuff not feeling like going anywere @CAPS4 to sleep or like if they had sometimes to do after they would be all lazy an not wanted to do anything at all, that why people should get out more and do thing withe there family and friends to have fun withe there like.",6
545,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Readers, Some of you might think people exercise computers. They don't act outside enough or interact with family or pets. You also @MONTH1 think that they are not getting enough exercise.Well you are right but I am going to explain way your wrong. You can do things like learn, socialize, and actually become healthy. The first thing you could do is learn. While you are on the internet you can go to learning websites. Some of thoes websites can teach you about faraway places like @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2 and many more. You can also learn about people and their cultures. Take @CAPS3 @CAPS4 for example, you could learn their culture and the @CAPS5 they celebrate and why. Another thing you could do is take online classes if you are having trouble in school. Another thing you could do so the computer is socialize. You might think or say that when you are on the computer you cant socialize with family and friends. Well you can. There are websites like @CAPS6 and facebook where all you do is talk to family and friends. Now you can webcam people. When you webcam you can see the person whom you are talking to you can hear them and they could hear you through a microphone on the webcam. Lastly you could go into chatrooms like @CAPS7 ( aol instant message ) and talk to people while you are on that sight. The last thing you can do is become more healthy. Is it not surprising? yes, you can go onto websites that teach you day by day how to eat right and exercise. Websites like @PERSON1 esang.com car give you a might eating schedual right for your . After that website you could go out and get the you will need. Another thing that the computer offers is hand-eye coordination. While you are looking at the screen your had is controling the "" mouse"" while the, mouse controls where you go on the worldwide web. Lastly you will eventually want to go outside after visiting websites that show you moments and gardens of this world. So now hopefully you agree with me that computers do acctually benift some things in life. I have showed you what you can learn about, talk to people and socialize and lastly help you with your health. ",10

A @LOCATION2 study showed that actually @PERCENT2 of use of the computer is communication with sites like facebook or @CAPS9. A scientist in @LOCATION3, @PERSON3, says @CAPS3 @CAPS2 humans tend to enjoy communication because it gives @CAPS2 a sense of unity. This is why so many companies are realizing that sites like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS6, and @ORGANIZATION1 are gaining in popularity."" And this is true. It is enjoyable to @CAPS7, talk, or email others. Without computers, this couldn't be possible. Lastly, computers give us the chance to express our ideas like never before. Now, stars aren't only made in @LOCATION1, but now you can make yourself famous on @CAPS8 or @CAPS9. Just ask @PERSON2, who's voice reached out and caught the attention of a major record company. Now, everyone knows his name and listens to his music. Like @PERSON2, the more wordy folks can express themselves by blogging their opinions. "" About half of computer use, "" says @CAPS1 to computer weekly, @PERSON4,"" is using blogs and videos to state one's ideas."" @CAPS3 can persuade others to think @CAPS2 @CAPS3 do and discover thngs that @CAPS3 have discovered. Self-expression is very important to society, and this is why computers have such an affect on people. @CAPS2 it is clear, computers have a positive affect on people and society. They allow us to learn about faraway places, communicate with others, and inspire the world around us with our ideas. Welcome to the future.",12
550,"Dear Newspaper, The world that we live in today is full of technology. Everything from check out isles at the grocery store to coffee makers at home are being upgraded all the time. The technology has many great things about it, but theres also a huge down fall. The most common technolgy device is the computer, its a great thing to have but its also very bad. The computer can be used to bully, it can take time from exercising and it even takes from your social and grammer skills. We all know the websites such as facebook, myspace and @CAPS1. They sseem harmless but its really just a place for harassment. Their said to keep friends in touch, butkids use them to say hurtful things about each other. Half the kids in my eighth grede class have admitted to either getting bullied or bulling over the computer. If so many kids are getting hurt by the then why do we all keep using computers? Many kids @MONTH1 say they don't spend to much time on their computers but @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids in my school admit that they do. Checking the computer is the first thing they do when they get home from school and the last thing hey do before going to sleep at night. All the time these kids spend on the computer is taking away from exercising and enjoying life as a child. I've seen many kids gain exessive amount of weight because they don't eat proper food they don't exercise and they shut down from reality all because they are obsessed with their computers. kids are even getting portable computers, thats how addicted they are. Do you want your kids like that? However, all these programs and websites that are on computers have a way to inneract with friends, and socialize. But all of this is taking away from your social skills, even grammer. Most kids and teenagers would rather talk over the internet thant face to face, and half the time they don't even spell word correct or use proper grammer. In the long run all this talking over computers is going to hurt them when it comes to school and getting a job. I know that computers are good for school because you can research stuff for projects and e-mail your job. But the time spent, kids getting bullied, and the now lack of social skills is not worth it. We need to cutback on our societys use of computers because it will help us all when it really counts. Just ask yourself do you want your kids getting bullied? Do you want to gain weight? Do you want to loose your social and grammer skill? Just ask yourself these questions and you just might change your mind.",9
551,"Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that people do spend a lot of time on computers, alot of teens spend alot of time on computers, I also think this from my own experience and I surveyed @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class. I would first like to expand my idea of teens spend alot of time on the computer, some teens go on the internet and do homework or might check their emails others go on @CAPS1 for hours and got addicted, so they're not outside or doing sports. In my own experience I used to have a @CAPS1 and I woud be at it for the whole day and I woud miss out on hanging with my family and friends. So I deleted the account. But, I still feel addicted to the computer I'm always listening to music or chating with my friends or checking my emails like most people The things* And lastly else to @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class, @PERCENT1 of people a day on it, @PERCENT2 said that they spend @PERCENT3 of people. That they now go on the computer. These that just one @NUM1 grade class most students are addicted to it.* no matter what age. This is why I believe that people do spend to much time or the. Many students go on @CAPS1 for hours at a time and in my own experience I have been addicted to the comp. and @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class when I surveyed them there ans a very high percentage of people that said they were addicted to the computer.

552,"Dear local newspaper I disagree because people should just enjoying spending time with famimely and not on the computer  doing nothing do you agree with me so far? Frist of being if you wast all you're time being of the computer there is nothing there is nothing you can get done as I have notice many shildren are on computer every right after school playing on the computer. For example my cosiun is on the computer evryday doing  but wasting his time are you still with me. Secondly children should be studying on the computer not playing video games and going in website that are not allowed more then @NUM1 do students and children are on the internet palying video games and doing something the is done everyday also I have seen many kids playing games on the computer. Thirdly student will never learn nothing if they wast there time because computer is for studing and many students don't have there time wisely as they should also many student should be useing comput only sometimes not everyday I have notice that so many students don't learn from compu for because they are not studing tests mre then @PERCENT1 stundent fail classes because of computer. First of people should be spending time with  and friends because they are teh most important people aroun ud not computers. Are still with me? Secondly friends are the most important people I ever had because they care about and love you like you're ther families but what if you just wast youre on computer how are you know all your friends. For example m allways on comput never goes to see her friemds amd her friends to to here because she never cares about their only computer do god get what im saying here. Thirdly family is also important then just being on the computer because they care about you have to at lease spend sometime with family for example many families stop spending time with each othe because computer is important to them. Lastly help you're community is goal because you make you\re city look you don't want it he be massy also many people quit help with commicity servic around the neighbor for example I have see  trash on grounds and because they dont care. Finally going out doing sports and starting fit is very important.

What would we do without computer! My fist reason why I believe that computer are a good thing is hand-eye coordination. According to @PERSON1 of the @ORGANIZATION3 of the eye @CAPS4 you have to watch what keys you are using when typing, your brain builds a connection with your hand, thus better eye hand coordination, ""@CAPS5 there is the fact that millions of @LOCATION1 are in car acidents a year, wich @PERCENT1 are cause by the fact that the driver of a vehicle had to look down at the whey to make that they kept thier car.

554,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 people use computers but not every one agress that it benefits society. In my opinion, computers benefit society. There are @CAPS1 websites that can help you find information. Computers also allow people to work easily. A third reason is @CAPS1 companies are able to use them to gain business. If you are doing a project or need to look up information about something, the internet is one of the easiest ways to find that information. Google.com has so much information about almost any topic you can think of. If you are a teenager that doesn't have a drivers license and there is no one to take you to the library, computers allow you to be able to hand in the report/project on time. There are also websites that find you direction, to where you need to go. Mapquest.com is a quick and easy way to help you figure out which way to go. Computers allow people to easily. If your family member lives far away and you don't have enough money for the phone bill, computers help you to not loose touch. There are websites that can help you keep in contact with old friends that you don't see anymore. Computers are one of the only ways that people fighting in the wars can talk to their relatives. They are not able to have phones and sending a letter can take a long time. Companies use computers for easy access to the public. If you are a new company, you can put a little ad on the sicle of the screen on yahoo.com and millions of people will see it. They of so use computers to make flyers easily and quickly. Making a hundred flyers by hand can take hours. But on the computers all you have to do is make one and then you can print out one-hundred. Using computers helps society. you can easily find what you are looking for and you are able talk to anyone you want. Also, it is easy for companies to attract business.

Around the world many people sell their computers to get money to @CAPS2 different stuff like, shoes, clothes or games.

556,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 of people use computers @CAPS2 for many different types of things. Computers are very beneficial to society. Even though people @MONTH1 use their computers too much, the tasks they complete help our world run smoothly. Also, computers allow us to keep in touch with friends and family that we don't see anymore, and they teach us valuable information very quickly. Without computers, society would not run as smoothly as it does now. One way that computers benefits our society, is that they complete tasks such as writing a paper, researching information,..etc, much quicker. For example, if you, the @ORGANIZATION1, needed to quickly print an article in the paper on the devastating earthquake in @LOCATION1, computers would greatly benefit you because they would allow you to type the article much quicker than having to handwrite it. Computers are very beneficial to society because they allow us to complete things very quickly and efficiently. Another reason why computers are very beneficial to society is because they allow us to maintain relationships with people from long distance and allow us to always keep in touch with old friends and family. Moving to from about @DATE1, computers have greatly helped and I stay halfway country. In a recent survey by @PERCENT1 of college graduate a computer stay in town friends from stay in but allow you to actually see the are our society is beneficial by computers because they world. reason society is because they alloe people very quickly. Search engines such as @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION4, @CAPS3, and more allows us to research anything we want to know at just the click of the button. This ability to know anything very quickly has agreat effect on people, without of this knowledge people becomemore intellectual and intelligent and with that intelligence, they make great things happen. According to @PERSON1, a computer scientist at @ORGANIZATION2, The knowledge people get from computer search engines allows them to better do @CAPS2 things and achive more in thier lives"". Computers benefit society and have great effect on people when they are balanced our with other important things such as exercise and socializing. They teach us new information quickly, perform tasks, quickly and effeciently and allow us to keep in touch with people across the world. If it weren't for computers things would take longer to get done and society would become worse. We need computers to do @CAPS2 things and do tasks needed to live life.""",10

For just one invention, the computer has many capabilities: @CAPS1 access for educational purposes, keeping people in touch, and opening people up to new aspects of life. The computer has helped mankind with various discoveries about our world. As far as many can see, this piece of technology has positive effects on people everywhere, everyday. The new trend in schools all around the globe is the addition of computers or a computer lab. The reason for this is that this technology takes learning to places it has never gone before.

Programs like @ORGANIZATION1 allow @CAPS1 to present their work in a new and efficient way. For children that don't ""school or adults that want a college education, computers let them learn what they need to from online schools. It is also important to @CAPS1 that they can keep in touch with friends after school hours. Computers are able to help them with this. How many times has it been said that communication is key to a healthy relationship? Computers, believe it or not, are on easy and way to maintain contact with far away people. Some friends and family keep in touch completely by computer. Because they don't live close enough to visit daily. If one is cautious and uses internet safety techniques they can make new friends with common interests through computers. This contact with new people is just one way that computer is croaden one's horizons. Computers are like keys; they open doors to new places and ideas. The use of this technology can old people in discovering so many new things they have never known before. Computers can help open people up to unique genres of music they have never listened to before. On the internet, there are many video tutorials that teach people different skills for free.

558,"To the Local Newspaper, Computers have a heavy impact on, todays society. People depend on them a lot but same people disagree. I think that computers have a positive affect on people. Computers are very entertaining. They can help find long lost friend and keep in contact with them. Plus they can be helpful with homework. Please proceed on reading to see as why I chose these resons. Firstly, computers can entertain. The are thousands of games to chose from. Dress up to educational. Which are good for young children of age five through six. As it states in the writing prompt it teaches hand-eye coordination. In addition to my first reason, computers help long lost friends. There are websites that help you find people. For example @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and yahoo. These websites help keep in touch to, with family. If theres no phone then theres always the computer. Lastly, computers can be helpful with homework. Sometimes you don't even need internet theres a calculator built right in! But a nationwide website thats used and children improve from it is edhelper.com. This website does work sheets and helps with the level the child is on. In conclusion, I think that computers do have a good impact on people. They are entertaining, keeps in contact, and helpful with homework. Please take my reasons into consideration.",8
559,"Some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on computers, and I believe that they are correct. Most kinds would perfer to be on the computer chatting with friends on line or spending hours on facebook but what is the point of this when there is a whole to explore, they don't enjoy natire like they should, and they spend less time with family and friends. If you are on the computer twenty four hours a day, seven days a week how are you supposed to get enough exersize? Well that's the problem you don't get any exersize. Some might disagree with me but the truth is, moving your hand over the mouse doesn't count! A recent survay has been conduched and @CAPS2 said that out of the @PERCENT1 of kids who own a computer @PERCENT2 are over-weight or indanger of being over-weight. @CAPS2 is sad to think that technology has taken over so much that @CAPS2 is ruining poeples lives. I go in the computer @CAPS1 too, but I am always sure to ride my bike after or go for a hike with my family @CAPS1 of the times I have softball practice so I'm not able to go on the computer anyway. Now what about the beautiful things in nature @CAPS1 of us are missing? The outdoors is one thing most of us take advantage on, some of us have @CAPS3 seen a day-lily are at night and new ones grow the very next day. This a facinating are might @CAPS3 see because they have a computer screen in front of their face. Kids really should learn to balance tecknology and the more important things in life like protecting nature and exercising. Yes, I know, that some will disagree by saying, ""but i am saying the rain forest, or the @LOCATION1, by being a member of this website."" @CAPS2's true you are helping but doing @CAPS2 yourself would feel a whole lot better. For example you could get a group and clean up the streets in your neighborhood or help plant trees in the park. The most important thing in life is family and friends, technology should @CAPS3 get in the way of that. If you loose everything what is the one thing your will always have? Loving family and friends of course! If family is so importand then why would kid want to be on the computer than at a family picnic? Is is because technology is taking over their life and clouding their vision of the more important things life has to offer. Don't you sometimes wish you were a little kid again running bare footed a field with your parents? That could be some what have if you got off the chair you have been sitting in for three hours straight and took a hike with your family. I might not be making much sense but being with family in person is better than instant messaging someone you just meet who lives half way across the world! I know that a ton of people are going to disagree with me when they read this but, I think technology is ruining some peoples lives. If you think about @CAPS2 a computer is like a @CAPS4-@CAPS5 @CAPS6 , @CAPS2 has a sugar sweet coating byt when you get the full force of @CAPS2, @CAPS2 traps you in and won't let go. A computer is ruining lives and experts have a right to be worried about people's health! All of us should get more exersize, spend more time in Nature, and be with family and friends more often than sitting on a chair glued to a computer screen.",11

I know when I go on that computer I am rude and disrespectful because when I am on you can tell me nothing because I was into the computer my attention move to the computer.

561,"Did you ever need to know something about another place, or maybe want to see your baby cousin who is not a baby anymore? Having a computer is a huge benefit to society.

This could help you learn about other cultures, places, or something as simple as what is @LOCATION1 creampie. the computer has endless knowledge. This is a huge benifit because a computer is one of the few tools that could help you expand your learning with a click of a button. Having a computer also allows you to talk to family and friends.

Which I know is a big benifit for everyone who has relatives that don't live right next door whether it helps your swing in baseball or to catch that touchdown, having a computer is a big help in hand-eye coordination. Believe it or not, having to type a paper for school helps out alot in hand-eye coordination. Having hand-eye coordination can help you out a lot in life whether in activities, school work, or jobs. It is obvious that having a computer is a huge benifit to society by having that ability to learn more, chatting with family and friends, or to help you pass the football with one of your buds.

562,"Dear Newspaper, Computers have advance a lot since they were first made. Some people see computers as a way to rot your brain, while others see it has a learning device. Although computers have a negative effect when it comes to children, they have more of a positive effect because they give people the ability to learn about far away places and allow people to talk to each other online. To start off, computers are bad because they can be used as a way to babysit a child. When you're on the computer you're just sitting there staring at a screen with pictures and words on it. Some parents use the computer as a way to keep their kids quite, instead of taking the time to go outside. By growing up in an enviornment like that the children only know how to play on the computer. Kids have a lot of energy, and they need to do something productive, not play computer games and talk to their friends. All school day they talked to their friends, they need to be with family doing something to keep them fit and healthy. By using the computer as a babysitter, you as a parent are leading your child to obisity because all they do is games, and they aren't properly taking care of their body. On the other hand, computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. If your teacher gave you a last minute writing essay on @LOCATION2 that was do in a week, what would you do? You can't fly to @LOCATION2 and ask the @CAPS1 people what you want to know. That would be a waste of time and money. And if you go the library and they don't have any books, then you're in trouble. But by using the computer you can find endless information about @LOCATION2, and you could finish that essay in a day if you wanted to. Also, if you were going to @LOCATION4, but you knew nothing about @LOCATION4 you wouldn't be very confident about going. And you would feel like a tourist. But, if you went online and searched @LOCATION4, you could find the traditions, the clothing, and so much more. Lastly, if you wanted to know more about a famous person who isn't around anymore, you could go on the computer and find pictures and what they did, how they became famous, and so on. Finally, computers allow people to talk online with other people. Say your grandma lives in @LOCATION3, and you can't call to often because your phone bill will get to high, what do you do then? You talk online since you both have computers and it won't cost you to call. For example, my grandma and grandpa both live in @LOCATION1. When we call there it costs a lot because they're so far away. When they got a computer, we each bought a webcam and called them everyday on @ORGANIZATION1. Now, not only did we talk to them, but we also get to see them too. If your friend didn't have a phone and you really needed to ask them for the homework, you could go online or on aim or facebook and ask them. You know you can always get an answer because everyone is always on the computer at some point of the day. Although computers have a negative effect when it comes to children, they have more of a positive effect because they give people the ability to learn about far away people an places, and they allow you to talk online with other people.",11
563,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that computers have positive and negative effects on people. In the past their have been more negative effects on people. In a survey taken in @CAPS2 magazines @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT1 of people, have negative effects with computers. Inmy opinion, I think comuters have a negative effect on people. First, people are not interacting with family and friends. @CAPS1 is very important to have interactions with people. When on the computer your not really interacting with. You just sit there staring at a screen. In a survey taken at @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT2 of people are on computer and not interacting with the people around them. Parents don't se etheir kids as much because they are always on the computer. Parents would love to see their kids move. Interacting with their family and friends will be healthy to them. Computers take the away fromhanging out with family and friend. Secondly, people don't get to enjoy nature. People on computer might go outside because they are involved with the computer. Stay in one room doing the thing for books for a @CAPS5 in a while people need fresh air. too but learning about nature is more nature. If you dont enjoy nature you dont know what is going on.NAture is all around us and why would you miss out on. in a survey taken in a local magazine @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT2 of people are on computer and. While people enjoy computer, nature. Lastly, people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising. Exercise is important for the mind and body. Our bodies need to stay healthy and fit. The lack of exercise is increasing fast. The more people get computers the people exercise. America is over weight already to join the People on computers most just long to become over weight. People rather play on computer that got exercise for a healthy body. Dr. @DR1 a local doctor, has seen more people become over weight and not exercise as much as they used to. He says computers do not provide exercise. He recommends that people use their computers less computers are doing more. In conclusion, I think computer negative effect on. My three reasons are that people are not interacting with friends and family, not enjoying nature and getting less exercise. I you to be in of negative effects on people. @CAPS1's important decision is up to you. ",9
564,"Dear Local Newspaper, Spending too much time on the computer is never a good thing. Whether you are doing work or things for pleasure. I strongly believe this because being on the computer too long will mean that you are spending less time excersising, interacting with real family and friends rather than on the internet, and being on computer too long can ruin your vision. Nowadays with all the great advances in technology, peoples are always glued to computer screens. Lets face it, once you go on the computer, it can get pretty addicting with all of the fabulous things you can do and when we get addicted, we don't feel like doing other things like excersising. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of the kids who use his or her computer for more than @NUM1 hours a day is obese. The cause of this problem is obvious and it is kids being addicted to computers. Since they are so addicted to computers, the do not want to go to the gym or anything. Another example is that in school kids have a choice of what electives the want to take. Many kids would rather choose the computer programming class rather than physical education. This also cuts down on their excersise time. Computers are wonderful things, but when it starts affecting your health and physical fitness, they are enemies. Interacting with others on the computer can be looked at as a positive but it is not since it affects the way you interact in real life. For instance, some people develop a habit from only interacting through the computer that makes them anti-social in real life. Furthermore, some kids can be the most pleasant people to interact with through the computer but then when you used them in real life, they are the quietest people in the world. This happens because they are more comfortable interacting through the computer. Also, they have lost their abilities to interact in real life. Interacting through the computer is great if you have family and friends in other countries but you shouldn't do it so much that you become uncomfortable to interact in real life. Your eyes are one of the most important parts of your body besides the vital parts. Most people do not know this but being on the computer too long puts strain on your eyes which is bad. This strain only lead to unpleasant things. For example, if you we addicted to computers, then there is a large chance you will get glasses someday in your life. A recent poll was taken and over @PERCENT2 of people who use their computers for more than @NUM2 hours a day have gotten glasses. Another example is that overtime the strain build up and up to the where even with glasses you can hardly see. Imagine a world where your vision is so bad that it is like your eyes are almost closed, that's what happens to people who use their computers too long. Local newspaper, you @MONTH1 think that computers are one of the greatest inventions ever, the you are right, however you shouldn't use it too much.",11
565,"Dear local Newspaper; @CAPS1 you know that computers teach you to do many things? You probably do! I understand you would like to know my opinion on whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Well, I think that it has a positive effect. Computers teach you how to type and learn the moun keys. It also helps you to look things up like people, states, and etc. Lastly, it helps you to interact with other students when not in school. i encourage you to continue reading to hear my wonderful and strategic ideas. First of all, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the learning skills to learn how to type I remember last year in @NUM1 grade, the tech ed teacher, ma @LOCATION4, told to go on a website that was all about learning how to type. It told us that the main keys were. A,@CAPS2,@CAPS3,@CAPS4 and @CAPS5,@CAPS6,@CAPS7, and colon(;). It was very helpful. From then on I typed like that. I think that learning how to type is an excellent thing. Typing helps you if you want to become a secretary or even a newspaper editor. My mother is a secretary down town at the low form called: @ORGANIZATION1. She works for three houses so she learned to type really fast. Typing is a big part of your life. You can use it for a project that you have to do for class, or an essay lthat you have to type to apply for a scholarship ro colege. Typing is used everywhere, even in math class my teacher types up things and pits them on the @CAPS8 @CAPS9. In addition, computers have a positive affect on people because they help look up famous people, states, countries, and etc. I remember on @NUM2 grade I @CAPS1 a project on @CAPS10, and in @NUM3 grade I @CAPS1 a powerpoint on I've also done a project on @LOCATION1 in @NUM1 grade, I @CAPS1 one on @PERSON1 this year for music, and I'm beginning one on @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3. As you can tell, I've been using a computer, basically my whole life, except when I was a baby, but now that I think about it, when @CAPS11 a baby I got a little fake computer. i know computers are @LOCATION1 but they do have a positive effect on people. When was the last time you need a computer to help you look up something or someone? Priority not too long ago. Computers are the real dael. They can help you do anything. They've helped me my whole life. To be continued, computers have a positive effect on people. They help interact with other people students, and fa mily members, when not in contact. I remember when my cousin moved away. i was so sad. I didn't went her to leave. So then she gave me her email to contact her on the computer so I could talk to her. The computer has many websites where people can interact like: @CAPS12, @CAPS14, @CAPS13, aol, msn, yahoo, g-mail, twitter, and many more. i like talking to people from all over the country. I talk to my friend when I'm at home. i talk to family members. My favorite website is @CAPS14. I am a fanatic of it. It'@CAPS2 spo much fun. Do you have a favorite interaction website? @CAPS1 you have any interaction websites? If you don't you should get one. This is why computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, i think that computers have a positive effect on people. One because they can interact with others. Two: they can look up things to help them. Three, they can develop a sense of typing. Thank you for reading my letter which I 'm sure has persuaded you to agree with me on how computers have a positive effect on people.",11
566,"Well computers can be a good or a bad thing. I don'@CAPS1 realy see @CAPS2 computers can be a bad thing for me. I also know @CAPS2 computers can or will help people all around the world. I think computers has positive effects on people like me. Computers teaches hand-eye coordination. It can help if you need to find out reasearch for a school project. You can create lots of things on computers like music, desiner @CAPS1-shirts, logos, banners and lots of other creative things. With computer you can look up available homes and apartments. You can even go online and fill out a job application and save trips to stores @CAPS2 cool is that!! Well im a regular person not rich not famous but computers provide lot of information people use today. Thats why I think that computers has a positive effects on people and you don'@CAPS1 have to be super smart to use one.",6
567,"Guaranteed, @NUM1 years from now we will still be using computers they are probably talking to friends, doing research on something or are typing up something for @ORGANIZATION1. Computers are wonderful and let us do so many things that we can't do by ourselves. Without computers life as we know it would probably be way different. Firstly, computers let us talk to our friends and family. Allowing us to communicate to one another without us leaving the safety of our homes. See, just recently a girl in @CAPS1 went over her friends' home to do their homework together. When they were done the girl tried to walk home, and she was never seen again. With computers we can do homework with our friends without leaving our homes. Clearly, without computers life as we know it would be way different. Secondly, computers let us do research about stuff we don't know about. Allowing us to do projects without having to look in old books that maybe not have the info. you're looking for if it was to search @ORGANIZATION1 it would give me a map pointing out it's location and the schools website where I can find out my homework for that night. As you can see the computer allows ud to do things that would take us far more longer to do regularly. Without a doubt, without computers life as we know it would probably be way different @CAPS2, Computers allow us to do homework on it wether it's research or just typing something up, it lets us do more capable things. Most of our daily homework is on the computer. Just @DATE1 we had to type a prompt up on vending machines in our @ORGANIZATION1. So far in @NUM2 grade almost every night our homework is on the @CAPS3 if we were to forget to write down our homework we would have another to get this information. Obviously, without computers life as we know it would be way different. Furthermore, computers are on advancement in technology that this uses constantly. Computers let us look up valuable info. on things around the world. They let us talk to friends and family around the world. They @CAPS3 help us achieve great things in @ORGANIZATION1, wether it be homework or classwork. Without them it would take double to triple the amount of time to do something without them. Finally, I believe that people who are against them just haven't used them in the correct manner.",9
568,Computers are good to use because it tells you everything. Like if you need a number to a restaurant you can just get it off the computer and sometimes when you wanna go on a vacation and if you wanna know how much it cost you go onto the computer. And computers are good because if you wanna travel to different places you can go onto the computer and look for a map and print it out. But sometimes computer are bad because when people go on web sites to chat peoples can be grown ups but talking to little kids. ,5
569,"Dear who ever this @MONTH1 concern, I think that people spend way too much time on computers. They do not exercise as much. People sit inside all day instead of going outside to enjoy nature. Family's and @CAPS1's are spending less time together because they have computers to talk to each other. Computer's have become a negative influence on people today. People need exercise to live. It keeps us healthy. With all the fast food places pople need exercise more now than ever. People do not want to exercise if they have a computer to go on. A staticstic is @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS2's @CAPS3 each have their own computer in the house. They said ""I would much rather be on the computer than outside"" (@PERSON2 @NUM3 grader at @ORGANIZATION1). Even students do not want to exercise when they could be spending time on the computer. Human only have so long to live. There is beautiful nature outside. We do not enjoy our surrounding because we would rather be on th computer. For example @PERSON1 would rather spend her day on the computer than enjoying the amazing nature we have around us. @NUM4 out of @NUM2 students enjoy nature every week. A young girl about @NUM6 never apperciated nature until her parents made her stay in a month. She now loves nature. because it got boaring day after day on the computer. Family and friends are huge parts of our life. We want them to be apart of our big events. Because of the computer we can talk to them whenever or email a video of our big event. But would it not be much better for them to be there, @CAPS4 you on when it is hapenning. When I was around @NUM1 @CAPS5 grandparents used to come to @CAPS5 soccer games, but now they dornot because @CAPS5 mom just records it for them to watch. I liked it so much better when they were at the soccer games, @CAPS4 me on. ""@CAPS5 family and @CAPS1 are the ones I want at @CAPS5 events, not to just show them after the event happend. A @CAPS6 is that everyone wants to share their event with the family. Computers aren't that great. They make it so family and friends do not come to see you. Computers take you away from the beautiful nature that surronds us. It limmits you on exercise and makes you gain weight, which is unhealthy. I urge you to use your computer less and exercise, see family, and enjoy nature.",9
570,"Dear readers of @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 people today are depating whether having a computer benefits society. Computer benefit society in @CAPS1 way like it could help the childer with thrie school work. Not @CAPS1 childern are very out going but if they had a computer thatn that will really help them. Not @CAPS1 kids have ways to find out what their going to be in live. I'm pretty sure they don't care right now but the computer will help them out. As you can see the computer can help society. Every childern who goes to school has homework since kindergarten to when they end school. The computer can help them with their math homeworks, thier science, and even their sosial studies homework. When your kids get older starting middle school they have to do reports & pajects that recuar knolige tobe able to write or do the paper. If your a and can't take your childern to the libarey to take out @CAPS1 books that could get lost and you would have to pay for something that has been but and is not ablt o use again. But the computer all of that to society. The compter can help the comuncation in so @CAPS1 ways. @CAPS1 kids like to go on @CAPS2 to chat and parents think that @CAPS2 is their world, but it could happen that they are aranging a group to for. Now a days their are a lot more shier people who are scared to @ORGANIZATION1 people and be friend. but now their could be a lot more depress. The computer could also help you because you could be late or unable to go to an apointment or to a meeting & you lot the person in. This is a great way why computers help societey. In sociatey their are not a lot of people who now right away what they want to be when they grow up. If they us the computer and are really good at fixing them when the're broken that the ran be as computer @CAPS3 are so @CAPS1 beautful places that people take pictures of and up loud them into their computer. Some people don't see their talent until someone points it out to them. @CAPS1 people could be have a bad day and write a story out of it and send it to some of their friends, @CAPS4 their friend can send itto a publushers and make this person @CAPS5. As you can see their are so @CAPS1 great ways you can use the computer to help your sociatey. Readers the computer can help you in your school work. The computer can help the socitey communicat. It could also help people find their @CAPS6. I think that the computer does a great @CAPS6 helping the sociatey.",10
571,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 the fresh air that cools your skin and the wind blowing through your hair while you are running side by side next to your best friend. And you think about the millions of people who spend their time chating on the computer. You also wonder about the amount of exercise those people would have, and would they be able to interact with friends and family members. Just think about your current lifestyle is it occupied with computers or is it free and wild? When you think about chatting to people do you think communicating in person or communicating by aim? I have surveyed friends and resulted with five out of ten go home and chat to friends online. This upset me because this half mainly had kids that did not play sports but yet they were very talkative, so in aim a problem I still have yet to find out. I asked question like ""what do you do at home?"", ""are you a computer geek?"". (@CAPS2 questions were only used to support my survey) The next time you are asked to chat online please decline before you to become obsessed with the computer. The amount of exercise a person gets depends on who it is. There are some who live on their computers like the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 (a comcast commercial) and some who don't know what a computer is (not commenting). I am here to teach about the benifits of exercising and not the un natural ways of a computer. Did you know people can loose weight by exercising? If you just pick up that old curling weight one curl is ten times as better then a click of a computer mouse dont believe me try it. Interacting with people is a big part of our life its how we get , give orders and its a lot faster type of communication then sending a email. Without interacting with one another we can suffer from depression. Depression can make people sick for example, my father, when @CAPS5 was divorsed the depression effected his body and mind. At the age of @NUM1 @CAPS5 got a rip in his small intestine that grew infecte and could have ended his life. I believe this was from lacks of communication and this happens everyday to everyone just open your eyes and relise what a computer can do to a man or woman. (@CAPS5 was remaried to bonnie and now carrys a scars on his belly). This is a movement that should change the opinion of many, do people spend to much time on computers? Just get outside and talk to your neibor see what they think. I relly hope you consider my argument.",10
572,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people have computers, and @CAPS2 people use them. It's been brought to my attension that the government is worried about people using them to much. Well I think you can't use a computer too much. They offer so @CAPS2 things such as information, communication, and life skills. That doesn't too bad. Informaiton is something we as humans live for. Also in @CAPS2 schools and jobs you need to know a variaty of unusual facts. Where can you learn these? Computers of course! When @PERSON1 (my teacher) gives us a research paper on walt disney, we use computers to find our information. With out the computer, I wouldn't know walt disney died before disney world opened. That clearly shows one of the @CAPS2 things we need computers for. Communication is another aspect of our lives. With a computer you can have @MONEY1 ways to comunicate. Yes some of these way can be dangerous but, @CAPS2 are safe. When I was in @NUM1 grade my teacher ms.casserelle set up a classwide email for us. This allowed us to email another school. This farm of online communication was perfectly safe. As long as the person using these forms of communication is sem-responsible nothing can go wrong. Where can you go wrong with that? Did you know that @PERCENT1 of your life skills can and are learned on computers? As a matter-a-fact your job involves a computer! One life skill you can learn is how to type. As I stated earlier research papers need computers, well it's not just for the information. You have to type them too. Most jobs in our world need the computer for something or other. Can you think of a job that doesn't require one at all? Ididnt think so. Information, communication, and life skills are all important to our human nature. Ithink computers are important to humans. Wether you admit it or not everything we do involves a computer to some degree. Can you spend @CAPS2 countless hours on a computer? Yes, but you need to. you need to.",9
573,"There are over @NUM1 students at @ORGANIZATION2. & out of @NUM2 students have computers. Computers have a positive effect on people. Students who use computers are more skilled than kids who don't by learning all the software and hour to be safe when online. Computers teach kids hand eye coordination, which can come in handy when playing sports. Also they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Finally it allows people to talk online with other people. Computers make people develop hand eye coordination. When someone plays a sport live baseball or basketball, hand eye coordination is definetly needed. say your a catcher, and then catch it. Almost every sport needs hand eye coordination and computers help you get it. Hand-eye coordination can also be useful to people with jobs. If you work with computers for a job, it is helpful to be well known wit the keyboard for fast results. Mostly any job along with sports requires hand-eye coordination. Some people have the gift that they have hand-eye coordination when there born, but for people who don't practice is the best thing. Learning about faraway places/ people is always facinating. On computers towns can put up webpages with pictures, information or even ways to help you plan a vacation. Theres also @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 can help you find any place or you can find out anything about that place. Computers even give you the abilty to plan or visit a loc location by buying tickets online or maybe you just want to read what the place is like, you can do all that. Finally, computers can be taken any place with you and say you go to @LOCATION1, and you don't speak there language, well you can go to a translating site and figure out what things mean. Facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, all of these sites make it possible for you to talk with other people. Personally, I have a facebook, aim, and even a e-mail. A lot of the time I will go on facebook and talk to my friends from school and even my cousins that I don't get see a lot. Talking online helps you interact with other people that you might not see in school or around town, and also your friends that might not have a cell phone. It helps you learn social skills that everyone needs. Computers give you all that. Its easy and free way to talk to anyone you know whenever you want. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. Almost everyone uses computers, and they aren't difficult to use. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Computers are one of the best things that has ever been made.",9
574,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 this ever happend to you? ""@PERSON3, did you do your research?"" ""@CAPS3, my computer crashed."" ""@PERSON1 did you practice typing @TIME1."" "" @CAPS3, my computer crashed."" "" @CAPS5, why weren't you online @TIME1? I really needed that sales report!"" ""I'm sorry @PERSON2, my computer crashed."" @CAPS6 it @CAPS2, you have realized that computers do benefit people. Whether its doing a class project, practicing for a computers class or exchanging buisness ideas, computers are a big help to society. First of all computers are a big help when it comes to a computer class at your school. There might be a certain speed that a person types and to pass the class, and the teacher could assign practice on your own home computer. It is a fact that @PERCENT1 of kids that have some kind of personal ocmputer at home get @CAPS7 A's in their computer class. I can back that up as well. In my computers class. our teacher stresses the importance of practicing at home to get your typing speed a little higher. Every @TIME1 I would practice but one @TIME1 my computer crashed, and I could not practice for the whole work with my luch the final exam @CAPS2 on @DATE1 instead of getting a @CAPS8 or A, I got a @CAPS9+. I blame that grade on not having a computer at home. Secondly, computer can be used for learning @MONTH1 different things as well. Maybe on a class report you needed to write something about the traditons of @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. Instead of running over to the library and wasting your time with a book. You could just open up your laptop and look it up on the internet. Not only does it make for less time, but @CAPS6 you look it up on the internet, you will get way more search results than @CAPS6 you search on a library derectory. In addition, by using computers, you can look up the cutomers of a foreign country, or look up programs than could help you learn a new language on computers, you can not only learn about your own country but you can learn about foreign ones. Thirdly, computers can enchance many skills that are needed in the modern buisness word, such as socialization skills communication skills, and even learning about the younger generation. @CAPS6 someone had not gone on an instant messaging program or a video chatting program. They would not make it in the world of today. The people need to learn to intract with each others, and solve problems. @CAPS6 someone is not used intracting with people, they @MONTH1 not make a good buisness man or woman. People must be able to communicate as well @CAPS6 people do not communicate with each other. We will all end up dies in the headlights. We will al be lost and will be able to run buisnesses, or hold meetings, for example I needed to plan at adore for my project group to work on a project, and so I went on my computer hoping they were online basically they never showed and so I could not work with my partners at all. I ended up doing all their work. In conclusion I hope you have absolutely coundered my opinion about the computers have on people like I said, computers can be helpful @CAPS6 comes to computer classes, researching foreigh affairs, and even communicating with others thanks again for even reading this letter.",9
575,"Dear editor, I beleve that people should have computers, The resons are it dosen't take @NUM1 days to email. You can learn about faraway places. Also you can talk to people around the world. After looking at these detail most people are likly to agree. Firstly it dosent take @NUM1 days to email you can email someone and it takes five seconds to get to the other person. While regular mail takes @NUM1 day to a week to get to another person. When you email some one and then the email you back it saves the and government money. Email is much fasters than the mall or I like to call it snail mail. Another reson is that you would be able to learn about diffrent contrys faraway and near. Would you be able to about @LOCATION1 from you living rooms without computers. No you wouldnt't. Without computers would you be able to learn about the earth quake in chile. No you wouldent. Compters are modern day telivision for kids. Lastly you can talk to people on the computer there is many ways to talk to people like facebook, myspace, aim, and vidio chat you don't have to call some one on the @CAPS1 when you can jus vidio chat with them. In conusion computers are good. You can email fast. You can learn about foreinge contrys in you living room. You can also chat with people online. I think computers are good what about you.",7
576,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers have been an incredible help to many people as they advance in knowlege. But, many people do not think about the negative affects of computers. Computers make research easier to find, and they organize data well and quickly. Computers make comunication easy, but there are many negative affects as well as positive. Chat rooms on computers are a great way to communicate quickly, but they can also be dangerous. More and more kids are spending time on computers, rather than outside excersising and communicating with friends and family. Chat rooms are commonly used by kids as well as adults. Kids use them to talk with friends, make plans, and catch up relatives. But kids aren't the only people that use chat rooms. Adults use them too. Some for good, others for bad. Adults sometimes have chats for their work to talk with their fellow workers. They can communicate easily what has been done and what needs to be done at the office such as what bills have been paid. This is a good way for workers to know whats going on outside of the office. There, are many other useful advantages of computers. Some other advantages of computers are the computers functions. Computers are good for finding information quickly. Computers are useful to find information for school projects. Computers can also take that information, and organize it on graphs, and computer programs such as microsoft powerpoint. Other pluses about computers, are that they can teach hand-eye coordination. Typing can help majority with this. Typing is also another advantage. If people don't have great pendmanship, they can use a computer to type essays, homework, and school projects. This makes reading the assignment easier for the student as well as the teacher. There are many advantages to computer, but there are also disadvantages. More and more kids are spending is their free time on the computer, instead of ouside exercising. This is causing kids to become less active. Being in a chat room all day is also a disadvantage. Kids today are using a new language in chat rooms as well as texting. They are using abrevations for words and phrases, such as ""idk"" for ""i dont know"". This language is damaging how kids read and write. Although chat rooms on computer can be useful, they can do also be dangerous. Kids as well as adults go into chatrooms and talk to other people, saying invalid information about themselves. Such as age. Some adults go into chat rooms and pretend to be a teenager. They talk to kids until they find out something like an address, phone number, school, and district. Once they got information like that, they can find out many other things about kids. this is extremely dangerous and unfortunately, it does, and has happened. As you can see there are many advantages as well as disadvantages. I believe, if people can find a balance between them, people will agree more about computers. In my opinion computers are handy, but dangerous. If kids are more careful online, and spend more time outside than on the computer, there would be less controversy. Parents would be less concerned about their childs safety and health if kids only used computers for homework, and were safe about who they talk to online. Also, what kids say in profiles. If all of this happened, there would be a balance, and I think people would be less drasticly over a period of time, and people would be more comfortable.",9
577,"I think that computers have great affects on people. Computers are a good way to @CAPS1 intouch with people, @CAPS2 online, @CAPS3 jobs, and @CAPS3 information on @CAPS4 facts.

578,"I do not beileve that computers benefit society. Kids can learn more but they spend too much time on line. When kids talk to people on line they don't know if it is really someone you know. There are techneral problems with them that deileate files. For these reasons is why computers do not benefit society. Kids spend too much time on computers. Computers do teach you more things, but they also have games. Children spend most of their time on games than studying. Chidren can get agressive when loss of exersise. Thats what is happening today. Kids are loosing exersise an are getting hevier. They can evan loose intrest. All they want to do is go on the computer. Kids talk to people, how do they know who they really are? People can make a fake e-mail adress and make a false account on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2-space. These people want children's personal information. Also if you are talking to someone that has a name of someone you know. The person just might be a freand. Like me. I was talking to @CAPS2 cousin on @CAPS1 (the account said his name) but it was his wife. That is why you need to be carful about what you say and who it is you are really talking to. Computers have virouses. When computers get virouses, they can deilete the files you want to save. If you had a video on the news you want to keep it. Youu put it under favorates, they you get a virouse that deleites the file. The video is how off the wedsite. Sometimes your computer doesn't bring you to the wed anymore. You how have to click alot of places to get there. For these resons is why computers are not benefical to society. Kids spend to much time on computers. Kids can talk to people they don't know on them. Computers have technical problems that delete files. Just remember there are many many more resons why computers are not benefical to society.",7
579,"Computers, one of the daily things we use and @CAPS1 with. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on the awesomeness of the computers! I love computers but, I as a teen know about managing your time on the computer. You cannot sit there and waste your time on the computer. The amount of time wasted on your computer could be the time you might be outside haveing fun. Theres lots of things you could do outside! As for some exsamples: @CAPS1 come ball, run around, go to the park, go exploring etc... Friends and family are very entertaining, I have lots of friends and I love them all! If you have some spare time you should hang out with them and have some fun, go to the mall! I always go to the mall with my friends insted of playing on the computer for hours on end.

580,"Dear, Newspaper In my mind the computer benifits us in many different ways. Computers are entertaining, computers help us with education, and the heath/safty purposes are fantastic. People love entertainment. Computers are very fun. At electronic stores computer games are sold. These games are usally good. Instead of having games that are bad for the brain most compuer games are not. My friend @PERSON2 bought a computer game last week. @CAPS4 says @CAPS3 is very entertaining but is not brain damaging. Everyone loves watching @CAPS1.V. On computers people can now watch @CAPS1.V. Not only is that entertaining but @CAPS3 will save money because you don'@CAPS1 need a @CAPS1.v. Now people can insteadly down load @CAPS1.v. shows and movies on thier computer. @PERSON1 just got a new computer for his birthday last week. ""@CAPS3 is so fun watching @CAPS1.v. on my computer and @CAPS3 is so easy."" @CAPS4 explained. Learning from @PERSON1 I hope you can learn how entertaning computers are. At school we use computers all the time. If we did not have computers we would not learn the same. On his new computer @PERSON1 can do all his projects and homework on @CAPS3. Before @CAPS4 had his computer @CAPS4 had to write out all his papers and when @CAPS4 finished @CAPS4 spent to long writing that @CAPS4 could not do his rest of homework. Now @CAPS4 can not type @CAPS3 out, and still do all his other homework. If you think that amazing then read this. Research done by @ORGANIZATION1 found out that @PERCENT1 of kids with computer are smarter than before they had thier computers. ""I was getting all @CAPS5's when I did not have my computer. Now I get honors on my report card because of my computer."" @PERSON1 says. I hope people can now be like @PERSON1 and buy computers. Do you want to have a smarter world? Computers open up an all news heath and safty field. You @MONTH1 learn a little about geneitics. @CAPS3 would have took about @NUM1 years longer to crack the code of the genes of we did not have computers. All the information scientists have learned from the human geno project can cure cancer and other dieseases. Computers are also safe to make sure your kids are safe. New technology can track kids. If an unfortunet event happens an your kid is missing then a computer can help to find him. A new mother lost her kid last @DATE1 while eating lunch at a park. She knew she had a chip in the childs body. She opened her laptop and found where her kid was. Amazing right. I hope everyone can have a computer for heath and safty reasons. I hope you can now see that computers benifit the society from heath and safty to education in school. Without computers we could not be where we are today.",10

It would help us meet new people because we can e-mail them, and chat with them on programs. It will also help us see new places because we can goon the internet. And look up place see. It will also help us learn about new things because we can talk to people and they could give us some ideas on what to learn about. This will help us all because we want to learn about new things, talk to new people and see new places. this is a good idea for all of us. We can all benifit from this because it's good thing for everyone to have. I think we should have computers because it would help us meet new people, seeing new places, and learn new things. This is a great thing for everyone. Not just some people. I hope you take this letter consideration. Because it will help everyone learned about new things.",6
582,"I believe that computers are a great help to society I believe this @CAPS3 when you don'@CAPS1 know something you could go on-line to look it up. Also if you are to sick or don'@CAPS1 have time to go out and buy things that you need from stores you can buy it on-line and have it @CAPS7 right to your door. My final reason is that computers can save paper buy having a lot of document on your computer. My first reason was that if you don'@CAPS1 know something you could look it up. A lot of times you could be watching @CAPS1.V. or talking with someone and you @CAPS4 wonder what something is or means. @CAPS6 instead of just letting whatever you didn'@CAPS1 know just pass on you could look it up on a computer and educate yourself and possibly others to. My next reason was that if you are to sick or don'@CAPS1 have the time to go out and buy things that you need from stores you can buy it on-line and have it @CAPS7 right to you door. This is a great help to the people who are to sick @CAPS3 sometimes they are @CAPS6 said they can'@CAPS1 leace there home @CAPS6 instead of starving to death they can have food or anything @CAPS7 to them if they just click a couple of buttons on the computer. Now, also this could help the people who are to busy to go to stores @CAPS3 right before they leave they could press some buttons and when they get home there stuff on sitting there for you. Back when my dad was a @CAPS2 and my mom was a vice-president of a drug producing company which sold oxy-cofin they had to have a grocery @CAPS5 ship foods to our house. They had to have this happen @CAPS3 they @CAPS4 worked long hours and they didn'@CAPS1 have the time to go to a grocery @CAPS5 @CAPS6 they had the food @CAPS7 to our house which was a huge help. My last and final reason is that computers can help save a lot of trees and paper. A big thing now is that we have to go green right, @CAPS6 instead of cutting down more trees we can just have all that on our computer which doesn'@CAPS1 we any paper. These are just some of the reasons why computers are a help to society. I could come up with many more ideas but can'@CAPS1 fit them just in this story, @CAPS6 finally rember people whole lives are on their computers.",9
583,"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I, for one do not. I think a decent amount of time on the computer, you can benefit from. But I do belive that computers are a huge part of peoples lives now. I think that people should get off the computer, and get some exercise more and more people would be so much healthier, if they took the time they were on the computer and exercised instead. On the computer you can look up places and see beautiful pictures of places, nature, and even people. But if people got off the computers and traveled and enjoyed nature, they would be able to live it, not just see a picture. Everything would be so much more fun if you were there and got to experience it, not just read about it. Another reason why I feel so strongly about people spending less time on computers is because they don't spent much time interacting with family and friends when you are the computer to much it seems like you drift away from you friends and family. Almost as if you are to ""busy"" to see them. So as you can see I highly disagree with the overuse of computers.",6
584,"Dear our local newspaper, Computers have a huge effect on people in a negative way. It could change does lifestyle dramatically. For example, people who sit there all day on the computers spend less of their time exercising, enjoying nature socializing with friends and families. Therefor, computers affect us greatly. One of the reasons why computer once horrible, is because people spend too much time on their computer and don't exercise. It's always important to stay fit and healthy. This could be @PERCENT1 of people who live in the @CAPS1.S is obese. This could a leading of obesity. I can connect to this because i had a relative, who admitted that he gained at least five pounds. for being on the computer @CAPS2, not exercising could. Is it really worth sitting in front of the computer all day eating? There are better entertainment active and will keep us healthy and exercising. Another reason, is that. it seems they're far more in technology you greatly, This will not improve your social abilities. You could lose self confidence in yourself and not be as open as outgoind. None like to be a loner. The feeling could be devastating. @CAPS2. this would make it very difficult to interact and make new friends. It's always a pleasure to know that you have so many lovind people around you. You could lose them with snap of you fingers by spending more time focused no the computer, rather than your friends and family. Lastly, it could be bad to get though life without your friends and family. In conclusion, people who spend too much time on their computer spend less of their time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with friends and families. The computers are like by matter the most in life, to being more focused on them. Computer affect us in a negative way that can change the course of our life.",10
585,"I believe that computers have good effects on people. Computers allow people to stay in touch with long distance friends or family. Computers have games for kids that help them learn, and, also, people learn new things, too. My first reason is that, computers allow people to stay in touch. If someone in their family live long distance then they could always use e-mails to talk. That way they wont lose each other. Also, sometimes, friends move away and you always want to keep in touch. Another thing is that, if they want to send photos to each other, they can use e-mail. Also, because, thru an mail takes forever. Please, let the people stay in touch! My second reason is that, computers has games kids play. The games kids play could help them learn more. Sometimes watching t.v. don't help. If they acutually play the game and see what their doing, then they will got smarter. That's what we want for our kids, right? Also, kids have fun playing these games. Do you really want to take the learning experience away? My third reason is, computers help people learn new things. Like, they could go on the computer and learn what's happening in the world. People can learn new words they never knew about. Also, pictures on the computer help, too. For example, if someone is traveling somewhere, and they don't know how the price. They can get on the computer and check it out, right? So, in conclusion, I believe that computers are good use. They help people stay in touch, help kids learn by playing games and help people learn new things about the world and more. So, I'm saying, please, keep the computers. They are not a waste of our time. Turst me!",7
586,"Although some people believe that computers turn us children into zombies, I believe that they effect us in a posotive way. Computers can help us explore far away places that we @MONTH1 never go to. Maybe help us connect with an old friend or just a little help on homeworks. One reason why I think computers are only helping us is they help us explore othe places. I know for a fact that every kid dreams of a place that they would love to visit. But not at all of us can afford to travel far away. Most families however, do have computers. With these computers, kids with a parents permission, can use the internet to learn tons of cool facts about their place. ""I have always wanted to go to @LOCATION1 but my parents just don't have the proper incomg"" said @PERSON1 of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 school @CAPS4 I used my @CAPS6 and the internet to discover. HUNDREDS of amazing facts on it."" @CAPS4 as you can see computers can help people realize their dreams. Another reason why I think computers are good is they help you connect with friends. If you are like me, you like to talk to your friends. A @CAPS5! But sometimes they are too far away to call if you don't want to pay for it. A solution a new wonderful machine called. The @CAPS6! You can chat long distances without being for it. This is especially good for me because not too long ago, one of my best friends moved away to @LOCATION2. I thoughy I would never talk to him again. Then I learned about @CAPS7 @CAPS8. It allows you to talk whenever you want, whenever you want! Now, me and my friend can stay in touch and @CAPS4 can you! My finale reason as to why I think computers are good is they can help you on homework too. Even have a tricky math problem you couldn't figure out? How about the capital of a state that visit, slipped your mined? Well the @CAPS6 can solve both of those problems and more! @PERCENT1 of computers these days come with soft wear in them that comes with a calculator. For the other @PERCENT1 you can download and install softwear onto your @CAPS6 for a low price. And every @CAPS6 made in this world has internet capabilities. All's you need to do is it on and get ready for a ride! @CAPS4 don'y worry about too much @CAPS6 use, because computers can only help us not hurt us. @CAPS4 remember, computers help us live our dreams to the full extent. they also help us connect with no another, and help us excel in school. @CAPS4 get on, and get goin. Have you used your @CAPS6 today?",10
587,"I use computer all the time and im healthy. Just because you use a computer more than getting exercise dosn’t mean your not healthy. I think computers help a lot in life. Now I will talk about some of the things that computers help out with in life. Computers help out with finding out what the weather is and everything you need to no. It will even help you, if you have a job and don't no what time to goin for waste. Computers are also fun. You go to different and play any games. You can also talk to people on them. Or get email with is like getting real mail but from an computer. But there @MONTH1 be some issues, People are useing then to much. They need to get more exirses. So thats what I think of computers hopfuly people will get more exirse now.",6
588,"Newspaper and Readers, Computers are a very large part of our lives and society. However, there are still people who think that computers do harm. Actually there are many positive effects that computers have on people. Among those effects are ease of communication, ease of gathering information, and ease of find entertainment. Computers have far more positive than negative effects. Computers have made communication easy for people. There are so many different means of communication using the computer, which are all free. For example, instant messaging, @CAPS1-mail video chat, chat rooms, @CAPS2 (and other social networking sites), are all there and help you communicate with friends and family. The positive effect that this has on people is that it allows them to stay in touch with people whom they might not otherwise due to financial or convienency issues. Being social is heathy for people and therefore communication is a positive effect of computers. Information is far easier to aquire when a computer is used. For example, if a kid needed to know about the climate of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4.S for his social studies project, instead of having to get in his moms, drive all the way to the town library, spent time looking for the book, he could just log on to @ORGANIZATION1 and go from there. This is a positive effect on him because it saves him some time and effort. Furthermore much more useful information can be found on the internet as well, such as: flight times, prices, restaraunts, stocks, weather, news, and basically any fact that you need to know. All at these things make having a computer a very positive thing in somebodys life. Computers are a great source of entertainment. In this economy, I know we all could benefit from not having to pay rental fees for movies and big prices for your exams or playstation games. Internet gaming is very amusing and you can find many good games for free. In addition to that, there are websites who offer free movies and television shows to be streamed right to your computer. These things are a great solution to the rising lost of entertainment. Saving money and enjoying good entertainment are both positive effects on people, and both offered by computers. I hope now that readers of this newspaper will now understand how good computers are next time you are for king for a late fee on a libary book or movie, remember that the internet and your computer have offered an alternative.",10
589,"Dear Local Newspaper, Are you spending all your precious time on a computer? On the computer your probably wasting every second searching or playing games. You shoudn't spend alot of time on the computer it will just wash away your brain. You shoudn't go on computers for a long time because instead you should be exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with people. First of all, spending too much time on the computer is not good for you because you should be out exercising. On computers you can't jog the fat you gain by eating food. By jogging instead of going on the computer you can lose weight and see the real world than the world behind the computer screen. Nevertheless computers are fun to go on like playing addicting games. but isn't it better to play a real sport like soccer. In soccer you have to use your mind and alot so it is much better than sitting or laying around dazed at a computer screen for a long period of time. Don't you love playing outdoor games! Like playing tag or hiding go seek isn't that more fun than playing an addicting game on the computer screen? For me I think it is. That is my reasons I think you should exercise then stare at the computer screen. Secondly, you shouldn't be on the computer for a long amount of time because you should instead be enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful and refreshing unlike a computer. Yeah I know computers offer alot but do they offer the fresh air outside, the warm breeze land living animals the earth. I don't think so and neither should you. Instead of going on your computer when it is raining not you should play with your pets and if you don't have any put a raincoat umbrella and go outside. Especially in the @DATE1 you should be outside enjoying nature go for a swim or bring your annoying little siblings to the park. There is more to often in use than going on the computer. More importantly, you shouldn't go on the computer because you are better off. Interacting with living people in person. On the computer talking to people you are going no where on the computer chatting with people it is impossible to read someones expression. So get off the computer and hang with your family and friends. Get into a fun conversation or debate. Make new friends when your at the mall or discovering a new trail in a park. Do anything but interact on the computer when all you see is typed words writing back to you. Get your self out in the world don't just interact with people but the world not the computer screen. In conclusion you shouldn't spend most of your precious time on the computer. It isn't nessasary for you to spend all your time on the computer when you could be exrcising, enjoying nature and interacting with people. I strongly beleive people should be outside than on a computer. So what are you waiting for get off that computer and take a hike!",9
590,"How does the computer effect people? @CAPS1 there are way's that computer's can be really bad and really good"", they're good. Because people who dont like writing usually just have a computer to type on. But people rarely do that, parent's and kid's stay on the computer not caring about nothing else but the screen the kid's stay up all night knowing they have school they dont even do their homework. I have proof my freind's, research show's, my mother also agree's. I suggest that you will agree on my opinion'. @PERCENT1 of my freind's agree with me because they have been through this, and they would'nt wake up to go to school. Dr @PERSON1's of @ORGANIZATION1 researched how parent's hardly spend time with their family. For example father's they basically always on the computer either working or looking up stuff. My mom say's that when she was younger she loved the internent. She never wanted to get off: @CAPS1 i hope youv enjoyed my opinion', thank's for even taking this time to read it. Thank's again.",6
591,"Click, click, click, ""@CAPS1!"" @CAPS2 no, your computer froe, what are you going to do now? Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches you information, you can socialize, and you can improve your skills. Without a computer, you'd be hopeless. Have you ever needed to do a research project, but don't have access to go to your local town library? No problem, @CAPS3 you have a computer at home. You could just sit down type in a few things, and get all the information you need, and more! You can research just about anything on everything, because the computer will have it. Maybe you want to learn something new, but there aren't many books on it, well there you go, the computer is your friend. Many people assume that computers are just for entertainment, to play games and have fun on your free time. What they don't know is all the research engines like google, netrekker, @LOCATION1,etc. All loaded with knowledgable information. Some people sit at home and read to become smarter, right? You can do this with computer, which would probably even be more entertaining than a boring ad book from the library. Have you ever thought to yourself ""the computer is just a way for people to get away from everyone else, and just have time to yourself?"" @CAPS3 you thought that way, you thought wrong! There are many ways to socialize with others through the computer such as e-mail, instant messaging, video chatting, etc. There are various ways to communicate with people through the computer. It is amazing technology because even @CAPS3 someone is in a different country, you can communicate with them in the click of a button. Ever heard of social networking? The name is self-explanitory. You socialize with people all across the world through a network. For example, these is myspace, facebook, twitter, tumblr, etc. That is a fun way to connect with others like relatives you have never met or that live far away, friends, friends of friends, etc. You can even be really social and meet new people, as long as your safe. You @MONTH1 be thinking at this point, that a computer is nothing more than research and socializing. Again, you thought wrong. Computers are a good way to help with your skills. For example, your hand-eye coordination. You look at the screen, type your words, look at the screen again, while clicking your mouse. That really improves your coordination. Also, your hand movement will get better. When you type, your fingers are moving all around the keyboard, creating hand muscles. Not just physical skills, but computers help with research skills. There are certain ways to research information effectively. This can help for future researching, and school purposes. Without all this, wouldn't a person be missing something? Computers play a big part in everyones lives, no matter what age they are. Computers definitly have a positive effect on people.",10
592,"Dear local @CAPS1, I think that computers are good for people to have. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. My second reason is kid might have to look important things up. My third reason is kids might have e-mails. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. Teachers mostly perfor to have the kids typ their eassys. When kids write eassy's they have to get information on what they are looking. My seocnd reason is kids might have to look important things on. They @MONTH1 have to fill out an alpaction out online when kids get older they want to look up schools they @MONTH1 want to go to. Kids in high school look up collages to get into when they are in like @NUM1 or @NUM2 grade. My third reason is kids migth have e-mails. When kids check their e-mails they are probably trying to see if their parents wrote them. Also some kids don't live near family so they e-mail each other on-line. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. My second reason is kids might have to look important things up. My third reason is kids might have an e-mail.

594,"Dear The @CAPS1 newspaper, @CAPS2 in front of a @CAPS3 @CAPS1 after @CAPS1. Oh, how much you want to just relax in the natural free air, but with all the advances in technology you feel it's your job to always be updated. I believe that advances in technology have had a negative affect on people. People aren't exercising interacting with family and friends in person, or having the ability to enjoy nature. Exercising means getting your hear to pound, your body to sweat and me because of endorprimes that ultimately make you feel better. @CAPS2 in front of a @CAPS3 all @CAPS1 does not support you with the natural urge to exercise. People who support advances in technology say, ""@CAPS3 are able to teach you hand-eye coordination."" @CAPS4, coordination is important but your body as a whole should also be put with account as well @PERSON1, voted # @NUM1 cardiologist in world says, ""more and more people are suffering from heart disease & attacks every year!"" be goes on to say, ""many links have been theorized to this on going problem, But none seem to up as well as my theory.

Its unbelieveable but, @CAPS5 individuals have a @PERCENT2 higher chance of developing heart disease!! There are many healthier things you can absorp yourself in. Like tennis for example In tennis you have to develop hand-eye coordination in order to hit the ball. Correctly. Tennis also increase your heart rate & burn fat cells, to help you lose weight. Statistics show that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people say tennis have actually made them more confident. This is because when people are able to have the determination to lose weight and head healthier , they feel they can can over the world. Isn't this the attitude everyone needs? Nature is all over and helps us are even if @CAPS4 don't notice. Like trees, they take in @NUM4) and release oxygen. Oxygen is key to life. Trees also are home to many living organisms.

595,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In this new digital age, computors are beaming more and more advanced. You can do just about anything with computors now from talking to people, to learning about faraway places. It is not all as wonderful as it seems, though for people's lives have been ruined because of the internet. It is for that reason that computors are not a benefit to our society. With computors we can learn anyting, go shopping, and contact friends. For many, this deletes the purpose of going outside. You can live your entire life indoors. This lack of exercise can lead to obesity. Also, living this secluded lifestyle can cut off ties with your friends and family. In order to use computors wisely, we have to learn how to balance computor time with an active lifestyle. The problem is, not many people do that. Furthermore, going online too much has been known to produce a second life. With websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 you can have a whole different online life, with friends that you haven't even seen before. Sometimes, people have even been known to think that their online life is better and get sucked into it. Take @CAPS4 of @CAPS5 for example. It is very popular, but also extremly addicitve. Some play until their entire lives are devoted to playing. Same with @CAPS6 of @CAPS7. This obsession with online games or @CAPS8 is not what internet was made for. Also, peoples lives and reputations have been ruined by computors. Cyber bullying is spreading like wildfire. Its anonymous, and can be detrimental to the lives of others. Internet videos of people acting like idiots never go away. There is one video of a college guy playing with a golf hall retriever like asword called @CAPS9 kid. The video has been viewed over @NUM1 million times. The guy in the video was made fun of for years, sued the people who put the tape online, and was forced into depression. Moving on, people can literally get their lives taken away with computors too. Identity and credit card theft is becoming more and more common. Even my dad had is credit card account stolen last year. Computors must help, but they can hurt much more. In conclusion, computors are a detriment to society. the can hurt people, cause addiction, and seclude your life. Surely this isn't the grounds for something to help society. Truly this is a good thing to let people use.",11
596,"With more and more people using computers. I think that this does not benifit society. I think this because mere cases of suicide are from online bullying, people get @CAPS2 addicted that they don’t exercize and become obeast, and because it is bad for the environment. Now more than ever before people are bulling. But not just showing kids around like they use to. Now the bullies found a new way, by starting web pages, emailing the person, or making threats online. With the internent people say things that they would'nt be able to say in person because you dont have to see face to face all the time. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of all teenage suicides are from being bullied online. The bullies get into that person head and cause them to hurt themselves because they let people get to them. If we didnt have as many people going online then the youth would be more protected from online predilors. As you sit on the computer and play games or to friends, you are most likely caling. Well when you eat and stay on the computer you arnt exercising. Well, more than @PERCENT2 of obeast people say they don't exercise because they are either to tired or dont have enough time. Of course you are going to be tired if you sit for a couple hours staring at a computer screen. When they say they don't have time but yet they spend an hour a day on the computer. That dosnt make much to me. Obeasity has becomea big concern it is the main cause of head problems. @CAPS2 get active The enviorment is a big concern these days. With toxic, the @CAPS1 layer and skin cancer on the rise. But how does the computer? Well computers use energy and let toxix for environment. Killing the @CAPS1 layer @CAPS2 the are much more powerful, hurting people. Yes and plant do help the @CAPS1 layer but when you print you @CAPS2 you @CAPS2 very hard to keep up with the demand of and the demand of the @CAPS3 have to eat, but with out trees, plants they eat? By the time our children's childrens are here, there @MONTH1 be @CAPS3 to no wildlife left, barely any wilderness and without the @CAPS1 layer many people will die of skin cancer. All because we are @CAPS2 addicted to using the computers. People lives, health, and the environment are all big issues that computers help to distore. How would you feel walking into your childs bedroom seeing them on the floor dead from being bullied on the computer. Or see a loved one suffer from heart problems due to obeasity becasue they couldn't get off the computer. Or in about @NUM1 years the @CAPS1 layeris completly distroyed due to the computers, with @CAPS3 to no wildlife left. Using computers does not benifit society. Sure its a quick look up. But @CAPS2 are books. The computer has every thing a local libeary has. @CAPS2 stop being lazy and get out. Put a stop to suicides, obeasity, and hurting the environment.",11
597,"Computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can help people learn about news in the world, places and people. Computers can also help people communicate with each other. Computers can also teach hand-eye cordination. People who support advances in technology, believe computers have a positive effect on people. Without computers people could not learn new things. On a computer you can learn about new places. People could see where something is, locate it, or learn about the place. I remember when I was working on a project about @LOCATION2. I had no clue what to do on the topic, so I whent on the computer and looked up @LOCATION2. It told me @LOCATION2 was located in @LOCATION1. Then it showed me a picture of @LOCATION2, and the history of the country. Without the computer I would not have been able to learn about this fasinating country. On a computer you can also learn about historic and famous people. On computers you can read biographies of them, or watch videos of whay they did to become famous. People used to read news out of a newspaper, on computers you can too without paying the cost of buying a newspaper. Computers can also give you a live feed of what is happening in the world. Without computers people could not learn. On computers you can also communicate with people that are very far away. Scientist did a study on how people communicate. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 said they used a computer to comunicate with other people. People can use a webcam, aim, or email to communicate with other people. To communicate with my family in @LOCATION2 I use a webcam. To communicate with my friends I use email or aim. Writing letters is to slow, on computer the other person your talking to can reply immediately. On a computer communication is made easier. A computer can also teach you hand-eye cordination. On a computer you see something on the monitor and you can click it without looking down at the mouse to click. This can help you in sports and give you fast reflexes. In many sports you need hand-eye cordination. For example, in basketball you need to look up while you dribbling or you while fall. Computer can give people fast reflexes and helps people in sports. Computer should be part of societys everyday life. Computer have a positive effect of people and they can help people learn new things, like, places, people, and news in the world. Computers are very benefital to society.",10
598,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers are good to society, because you can read the news paper online, email your friends and family, and can play games and watch videos or movies. Knowing the latest news is very important, news paper are okay but you have to pay for them with the news paper online you can get the latest news for free! This way you can save money and trees. Heres another way of saving trees. E-mailing is a good to talk so some one far away and it's a lot faster than just regular old mailing. E-mail is also good for e-mailing links to cool websites, on e-mail can send a funny picture or a video or an important notice. So, Computers can be your news paper and a good and fast way of communication. It also can be useful for entertainment. Computers are one of the most popular entertainment sources. Computers allow you to go on game sites, watch videos or movies or play on online game on just a regular @CAPS1 game. I know whenever I'm bore I go on my computer and I can always find something to don on line or find a movie to watch. So, computers are very popular, in many areas computers are helpful in news, communication, and entertainment. People just need to look at the positive aspects of computers, then they will see how great they are",6
599,"Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper: I am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers have a positive affect on people because they help students as well as many others study, they allow you to access stores by shopping online and computers allow people to communicate. After reading this letter, I assure you that you will agree with me. The first reason why computers have a positive affect on people is because they help students as well as many other people study. If you have a test or quiz in @CAPS1, you can go on your computer and print out @CAPS1 practice sheets. Or if you have a vocabulary exam you can find the definitions fast and easy on the computer. In the times @ORGANIZATION1, a statistic shows that @PERCENT2 of students in the @ORGANIZATION2 find computers there best studying tool. They find it affective and fast to use. Last night, I had a test on the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and I went online, typed in ""The @CAPS3 @CAPS4"", and found @MONTH1 helpful cites on it. It was useful and did not waste my time. Using a computer for studying is a very good reason why it positively affects people and makes them happier but their is on even greater one. Secondly, computers have a positive affect on people because it saves people time by shopping online. So many stores now allow you to purchase stock on me. it is easy .with a click of a button and saves you time driving to the stores. In @ORGANIZATION1, it showez that @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 across the @ORGANIZATION2 said shopping online improved their lives by making it less hectic from driving from store to store. Shopping online creates a positive, less hectic life for many people around the world. Online shopping having a positive affect on people by making their lives less busy is a great reason but there is one last even greater one. The last most important reason why computers have a positive impact on people is because it allows people to communicate with each other. Communication through computers are extremely powiar. With instant messaging or email of even blackboard, a new teacher-student communication site, computers are often being used for communication. i surveyed @NUM1 kids and @NUM2 said that computers are there main source of communication. Communication through computers it has a positive affect on people in many ways like to communicate easier for work, to talk to your best friend on e-mail who just moved to @LOCATION2, or to simply send out invitations for a party to all your friends. Computers have made life easier for many through communication, making a positive effect on them. This is why communication having a positive affect on people is the most important reason. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on people because it allows them to study easier, saves people time by shopping online, and allows people to communicate. With all the ways computers help us there is no reason why they would negatively affect us. I know that you will take this into cons ideration. Computers are making our lives easier day by day and who knows what they will be able to do in the future.",9
600,"Dear local newspaper, Are computers a bad thing? Certainyly not! They can be distracting but in a enlighting way. How? Computers give you extra knowledge, you can connect with people and if you think they take away exercise, they do not, they can actually help exercise! My first reason that computers are a positive device to have is they can give you extra knowledge. That is great for the brain! When you are sitting at home with a ton of, think again, the computer is there for you. Ask or search anything and you should have a @PERCENT1 guarentee your answer will be found! If you feel like you do not know many interesting subjects like a culture of some sort or something that you heard your computer can tell you. Just one computer can enlighten you with so much. Now when you go back to school you can brag and say ""@CAPS1 you know,?"" People will be amazed. Lately experts have been concerned that the computer device is a distracting item and it will keep you from exercising and enjoying nature, @CAPS2, no need to worry you can learn just nabcur anything on nature when you surf the web! You @MONTH1 find out more of what is in your maryard then you already knew. Exercise! Are you worried you do not get enough exercise? @CAPS2 then, go onto youtube.com, type in exercise and work out. You will come up with millions of exercise routines you can do right infront of your computer. Another thing you can do it get online for how to stay healthy and exercise! Lastly the experts is have been that we people are not having a sccial life and interacting with our family and pals. I would say we spend more time interacting with our buddies and close ones online then we do in public. With sites like facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and more we are talking to those people instantly! We are setting up our weekend plans online and a lot of our social life is there. Sometimes we have family that lives long distance, no one wants to pay for a call so we have the internet to connect! In a nut shell, knowledge, exercise, and connecting with buddies are all positives in the computer. You can multi-tase so simply with just one electronic device and that is the computer! Experts, you do not need to worry.",11
601,"Dear Newspaper editor, Computers have been a great advancement in technology, but some people think otherwise. It is a great thing to have some people say but others think it is a hazard to health. I think it is an excellent thing to have. I have come up with @NUM1 reasons to support my opinion. Computers help you keep in touch with distant friends and/or family, they assist you in research, and they even let you do shopping. Firstly, if you have any relatives or friends that live far away computers have websites such as aol or facebook & myspace that you can use to keep in touch with them. Most of them are free to create an account so you don't need to worry about monthly bills for them. So this is a lot better than driving and paying gas for visiting. Computers even have webcams for video chat. With video chat you can see each other & talk at the same time, thats amazing. Secondly, you can search the web for research. If you have a project and you need more information than books give you then just use google or ask.com. You can easily find the details and information you need. All this takes is just a couple minutes, which is alot better than reading for an hour or time. Lastly, if you really want something or need it just shop online. For example if you are a really cool toy that you want to buy for your daughter or son, but its not for sale in stores then buy it off the internet. They even ship your item fast. I like buying off the internet. When I really wanted a bike I saw my mom end up getting it for my birthday. In conclusion, computers are very handy. If you need information, talk to someone, or buy something its got it. I use computers a lot. I think they are very great to have.",8
602,"Dear @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 your workers wake up in the @TIME1, they stretch their right muscles and put on their puzzy slippers. They wonder down the hailway and open their @CAPS2 book air to check the weather for today. They go on @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1, and etc. to view their e-mails sent from work friends, and family. They check the time on the bootom of the laptop screen and lag onto to play some they are getting ready. Society today relies heavily on computers and the net work their keeps us all connected... the incorect with technological advances happening today, people are now using computers to help with their work. But is that a some @MONTH1 say that it is due to the fact the amount of spent on the computer is the much and that it stop from with friends but it does computers help with the skill of typing, help with fast end easy and helps friends and @NUM2. of through @NUM2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc I believe that computers have a possitive affect on people and once a great addition to society. to begin, computers help to reach @CAPS6, children, and even adults the skill of typing. Statistics show that more and more jobs on computers and hire people with a higher words per minute ability with almost @PERCENT1 of adopting new computer and using computers to store information to their company, computers are necesity and so is the knowledge of understanding computers and being able to type. Moreover, @CAPS6 these days are depending on computers for research to order to do projects and information I can personally connect to this because being a student on @LOCATION1 school, I am assigned project what involve typed words and or information. how hand it would I had to hand writs all of my work and on the for information. @CAPS1 multiple @CAPS6 are assigned the same project, the does not millon @CAPS6 to check looks out @CAPS5 there was no computer to use, what would I do? for @CAPS6, computers and a great thing. Furthermore, @CAPS6 and even adults enjoy social time, but @CAPS1 friends are family line faraway or you are not able to visit three, the computer connect in handy computer help to keep friends and family connected through @CAPS3, @CAPS8, @ORGANIZATION1 / or @NUM1, I.M / @PERSON1, and webcam video chats. All of those computer related things would not there for @CAPS5 there were no computer. Would you want no be disconected from family and being social is a key part of being You why shouldnt we keep them and why with all of these possitive things about computer would ever make you doubt them? In computers are wonderful things. They he is to build skill of typing, help and it easy, and also help keep and family connected. Computers affect people only good ways and help everday life be easy. so, believe that computers are a great thing and that without them, even just talking to family could be jeaporadized. Lets keep computers",11
603,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 you agree with what I'm trying to tell about people use the computer more than exsersise? Well first more and more people use computers but how does it benifit them. Secondly, they are spending to much time on their computer than exercising. Finally they spend less and less time with their family and being active. First more and more people use computers but how does that benifit them. Computers is just a adicting technology that makes you lazy and slow. Does using the computer @CAPS6 you with problems your having with your family...@CAPS11! Well I know this from ex perience. My mom is always on face book and I hate it I figure she loves the computer more then @CAPS7 do you want your kids to think that about you? As the days pass by her time on the computer increase and @CAPS1 sitting there needing @CAPS6 on homework and i'm thinking @CAPS2 @CAPS3 YOU @CAPS4""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS1 @CAPS9. See i was just thiking that cause @CAPS3 I said that it's a rap for @CAPS7 but @CAPS1 just trying to say this computer went benifit anyone @CAPS11 way. Second I want to inform the @CAPS12 @CAPS13 paper is that people are spending more time on the computer than exsercising. The obeast rate has been higer than it ever been. I believe by @PERCENT1! COME ON this is @CAPS14! people come home by @CAPS15.K and other fast food @NUM1 go on the computer and eat. Over time you get bigger and your apperence change. You began to look sloppy and nobody wants you. You look back and regret doing what you did. Finally you spend less and less time with you family. This causes you grow apart from your family your kids pick up bad habbits and do the opposite of what you want them to do. This tells @CAPS7 that the computer is just @CAPS11 good at all. In conclusion I informed you on why I dislike computers. They @CAPS4'@CAPS5 benift you. Makes you lazy and keeps you from you kids. So do oyou the local @CAPS13 paper agree? ",8
604,"Dear local newspaper, I've heard that not many people think computers benefit society. I disagree with that. Computers benefit society by teaching hand-eye coordination, allowing people to learn about foregin places, and allow people to communicate with others online. Some people were basically born with hand-eye coordination, but most people weren't, like me, for example. But, thanks to computers, my hand-eye coordination has gone up! ""On average, computers can increase a persons hand-eye coordination by up to @PERCENT1 says @PERSON2. Think of it, just by learning to tye, your hand-eye coordination can go up @PERCENT1.! That's amazing! Having good hand-eye coordination will get you far in life, and helps with small, everyday things such as playing an instrument, or doing household chores. It also helps in sports. You need good hand-eye coordination to throw, catch, and aim. If more people spend more time on the computer, then the population's hand-eye coordination would increase, and who wouldn't want thats. Have you ever heard of @LOCATION1? It is a country in @LOCATION2 that no one really knows much about. By looking it up on the computer, you can become an expert on the country! The computer gives us access to a lot of knowledge, and will make us more of people around the world. This can improve our travel. Instead of going to the same place every vacation, you can go to a place you saw online that looks just as exciting. Also, by learning about other countries and the people in them, we gain respect for them. We @MONTH1 also learn about their traditions, and culture. ""The internet gives us access to the world,"" says @PERSON1, ""we can learn so many new things that will make us more of people, countries, and the environment."" @CAPS1 is right, we can also be aware of the environment. Since global warming is a problem, we can learn how o preserve foreign places by learning about them on the internet. With a click of a mouse you can virtually have the whose world at your fingertips! In a recent study @PERCENT2 of people said they don't have time to meet with old friends. The internet, however has made it quick and easy to talk to people online. Websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 can keep your social life in tact, and can even reunite yu with old friends. For example, @CAPS2 suggest family. You can keep in touch wih many people trough @CAPS2! Also, you can make new friends. Most teens say they are always willing to meet new people, and the internet is a great way to do so! Sites like @CAPS7, and @CAPS8 can can help you find friends by connecting you in a chat room to a random person, just to talk. I once talked with someone on @CAPS7 for over an hour! We found that we both have @CAPS4 accounts and keep in touch there! This also helps you gain confidence because you @MONTH1 have the courage to say something over the computer that you would't say real life. The computer can really amp up your social life. As you can see. computers don't just ""your barain,"" they imprdove hand-eye coordination, help you learn about far away places, and improve your social life by allowing you to talk to others. Computers benefit the society more than anymore will ever know!",11
605,"These have been many advancements on computer technology and there are people who are for it and there are people who are against it. In against it and ill you why. You spend less time exercising which you'll gain weight. Spend less time enjoying nature which means youre lost with anything natural, an spend less time with friends and family which probbaly prove you, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 not saying the computer is a bad thing but to much of it certaintly is. First, you spend less time exercising. you don't exrcise you gain weight, you could do most of the stuff you could of , and you risk health. This is a bad thing because your not yourself anymore and if it goes to far you can't even a move. So if this sounds scary plan your time on the computer, so it doesn't happen to you, time is so limited that we waste it on stuff in computers so think before you go on the computer maybe you can go for a jog outside. Next, you spend less time playing nature. Nature is so beautiful but its being destroyed and we do nothing. There are only a few hundred maybe they said of us these truly help the environment, and if you think then few hundred of thousand people is alot . @NUM1.billion people of earth. Its a crying shame to see something so beautiful die, while most of us do nothing to help. Finaly, you spend less time with friends and family. This is the most important reason of all. The main course if you will of it all your family is so important because there your best friends whole wide world. Your friends important them. Your family might leave you if you your life to the computer if you they you so be carfully. Your friends are dust as important as your friends they both make you laugh. have good times and cheer you up when you upset. Just don't forget that as be gone. Well, there you have it my three reasons for being against work on the computer and they all sound like a good reasons so lets recap it all shall we. First, spend less time exersing, very important. Next spend less time enjoying nature, very important. Finaly less time with friends or family the most important of all. So hoped you enjoyed my essay and you've learned something . So remember to much of good thing is bad and I'll just leave you with . ",8
606,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I agree with some of the perfesionals that think the computer keeps people from exersising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with friends and family. Some people thnk it's cool to be on the computer @NUM1 @NUM2. The truth is the computer with internet is like having @CAPS1 at your fingure tips, distractions, and more. You can find just about anything on the internet these days. Some people use the internet for doing homework. Sometimes people can find the exact answers to an assiment. That means they are becoming more dependant on tecnologie. If the world becomes more and more dependent on the of computers and such, that could mean things. the world is suffering because people are neglecting to pick up their trash and to try to stop @ORGANIZATION2. Most people, instead of taking action, will be on the computer. People are becoming more and more lazy these days. As I stated most people are becoming more and more lazy these days because all they have to do to have fun is sit and do little movement. Saying that, people are neglecting to exercise and eat right. They are also neglecting to spend time with friends and family. Instead of texting or @CAPS2 someon try to call them. Or maybe even wehn you're free you can go and make plans to visit with your family. Taht's all I ask is that you especially spend time with family because you can always get more friends or anew computer. But your cant get a new family.",7
607,"Dear town @CAPS1 paper, I would have to pick being for computers. There are a couple reasons why I'm for computers and they are being able to talk to friends online, being able to learn stuff, and you can also play video games. One reason that I would be for computers is so you can talk to freinds online. So if you have a facebook or myspace you can talk to your friends all day if you wanted to. What I mean is simply by typing in what you want to say to your friend they will receive those exacte words then they'll reply. For example if you wanted to just say hi then your friend would look at his/hers messages then just reply. So being able to talk to friends online is one example why I for computers. Another reason that I would be all for computers is being able to learn things. So if you wanted to learn a language then you would go to google or something and try to find a fast easy site. What I mean is if you goto google a whole bunch of site's will come up, so what you want to do is find the fastest easyest site for you. So being abe to learn important things like a language is another reason I'm for computers. The last reason for me picking computers is because you can play video games. What I mean is if you were borde and noone to talk to then you can get on your computer and play a mind numbing game or an educational game for class. For example in science class we played a game on the computer and it had to do with gravity and that was what we were learning about so it was an educatinola game. So that is the last reason why I'm for computers. I'm for computer because you can play games. So now you know why I'm all for computers. I am for computers because you can talk to friends online, learn stuff and play video games.",8
608,"Yes, I do think that we should continue useing computers because it helps us stay in contact with other countries around the world, it forms a balance, and it also makes life simpler. First of all, computers help us stay in contact with the other countries around the world. Without computers we would not be able to @CAPS1 or evan video message other countries about important events. Sencond, we have to balance computers and excersing and interacting with just sitting on the computer but computers can help us interact with family and friends by emailing or video chating can also help you stay in contact. Last useing computers makes life simpler like how its so much easier to write an @CAPS1 and not a letter and its easier to instant message someone then to call them also for school projects you can make your project look so much better by adding pictures and diffrent fonts just hand writing it. That why arents arent a waste at time because they help us stay in contact with the other countres, they form a balance and it also makes life simplier.",7
609,"Dear Newspaper, People should play with their family and friends instead of staying on the computer all the time. People would be more fit, have closer bonds with their family, and get better grades in school. People will alway get fit faster if they excersise instead of staying on the computer. When the computer is unpluged, anyone has a chance to go out side and play. When people go outside to play with their friends, they excersise which causes you to lose weight. @NUM1 scientist believe that it is better to go outside and socialize than to sit on a computer and watch monontenious videos. People would be more active if they stay of the computer and went outside because it will keep you happy with your body, and healthy so you don't die of a terrible diseases. Their would be closer bonds with families if people stayed of the computer. Family would be closer together instead of spreading apart by computers. Your family is always their to comfort you when ever you have a terrible day. Your family will help you get over any problem so that you can keep moving forward. If you did this by computer, all you see is a persons face who can't comfort you with a hug. Without computers, you get a closer family that loves and supports each other, but with computers, people just drive their families away. Closer families also help children in school get better grades. Families who stay of the computer and have dinner with their families typically have children that get better grades. @NUM2 scientist agree that kids who have dinner and play with their families get better grades in school. If kids get better grades in school from staying of the computer and spending quality time with their family, we could get great inventions that can help mankind in every single way. All of can happen from staying off of computers. Staying off computer is a great way to help yourself and other people to. It would get people fit, create closer bonds, and create more gradutes who go on and achieve the greatest of all inventions. Imagine what else could happen by staying of computers.",9

611,"Dear Local newspaper, I have concerned because lately a lot of people have been using computers alot. My concern is that they haven't been exercising much, they arent enjoy nature and they aren't spending much time with their family. This is not a posiitve way for their life. In my opinion excercising is a very, very, very important thing to do. This is because you need to mantain a healthy diet to stay healthy and you need to excersise. Some people I know don't exercise and they are either overweight or not healthy. People are ""busy"", as they say, uisng the computer to do all there work because they just don't like using the old fashion way, which is going to your job and doing your work. Everything is different now and people have become lazyier than ever before. Would people be lazy, if computers weren't around? Of course they wouldn't be. They would have a happy healthy life. Now-a-days, people don't go out and explore the world much they just go online and nthey search a place up on a google. They don't see the real thing though. they see pictures and everybody knows that seeing the real thing is way, way better than looking at a picture. But i guess everyone forgot about that. Computers have everything online, no wonder poeple don't want to leave their homes and if they do leave, don""t worry they have a laptop with them. Computers are even portable go wherever they go their still going to go online. Poeple have also spent less time with family because they could talk to them online in a s chat room. This isn't a good thing because what if you were talking to your ""mother"", well at least you think is your mother but is someone else and your talking about your, I didn't know, something private and that person on the other computer, ""your mother"", will know about that and can cause problems with you. You know waht I mean? Like if you were talking about your credit card and that person asked you for your credit card number and you gave it to them then they could cause problems. Online isn;t a safe place, thats why you should talk in person not on a chat room. Well I hope that you put my letter in the newspaper for people could exercise, see the nature and be with family, like they were when they didn't have computers around.",8
612,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1 and I am a @ORGANIZATION1 citizen. I believe that computers do NOT benefit society of all! In @CAPS1 opinion, they make our town worse. People spend way too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. All of these things are @CAPS3 computers are doing to our society and it's time to make a stop to it! First of all, people are on the computer way too much. Teens are on social networking sites, adults are on chatrooms, and kids are playing computer games. Instead of that, people should be playing outside, or going for a walk in the park. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of adults are overweight? If people cut back the amount of time indoors, we could probably bring that number way down. Also, who knows @CAPS3 teens are doing on the computer. Computers have good things but they can also be bad. For example, chatrooms who knows @CAPS3 kind of people are in chatrooms. Children need to be careful about @CAPS3 they say or show on the internet. Instead of playing games or talking to their boyfriends and girlfriends, teens should go outside and exercise. Second, more citizens need to enjoy nature and the beautiful senery around them. Were all so busy running to check our e-mail, we don't notice @CAPS3 a beautiful day it is outside. On a nice @DATE1 or @DATE2 day, people should take this kids to a local park or pond. This reminds me of last @DATE2 when I went to @CAPS1 cousins house. @CAPS1 aunt only allowed us to watch one hour as a day, that included the computer. We were outside every single day, even if we were just staring into the clouds. This kept us active and enjoy the environment. @CAPS1 last reason why computers are badly affecting society is that computers take time away from interacting with family and friends. I know @CAPS3 your thinking, when your on the computer you are talking to family and friends, but it isn't the same. Instead of instant messaging call them. Maybe even invite them our to talk face to face. That reminds me of @CAPS1 sister. When I get home, she will normally be on @CAPS2. Now, instead of getting up and coming to talk to me she will text me ""@CAPS3's up?"" or ""@CAPS4 was your day?"" Computers help people communicate, but they also take communication away. As you can see, I have given you three reasons why I strongly believe computers are badly @ORGANIZATION1. Not only @ORGANIZATION1 but everywhere! You need to open your eyes and understand that people spend way too much time on computers, they allow people to not enjoy nature, or interact with their families. Please I'm asking you to understand that our society will crash it we don't fix this issue. So @CAPS3 are you going to do about it?",10
613,"The innovation of computers was a great leap into discovery. Unfortunately, the negative aspects of this magnificent invention detract from the novelty. With the computer came a plague of not exercising and a disinterest in, perhaps even an inabilty to enjoy nature. On top of this destruction of the mind, this monster is the cruel cause of many declining relationships for who has time for friends and family while in the middle of an internet game? As unique and intriguing as the computer might be, it is slowly destroying the mind. Increasing interest in a monitor tends to result in decreasing care for exercise as well as a decline in the amount of exercise gotten each day. While playing on the computer, the mind @MONTH1 be racing but the body sits unmoving, @CAPS1 activity is being done. Indeed, for some the addiction is awful enough that the person only moves to get food, use a restroom, go to bed or when a parent demands it. All of the day's food settles into the stomach and little to none of it is burned off. Meanwhile, in some of the more severe cases the person is so entranced that bedtimes are pushed later. Sleep is essential to the body and mind and going without can be damaging. Nowadays the computer detracts from the sleep and exercise that the body requires. Even nature suffered from the advent of computers. Fewer people went out to admire its beauty. Nature is a wonderful teacher about the circle of life and the natural way of the world. Oftentimes parallels can be drawn between the wild and the tamed. Attached as people are to computers, they cannot experience the world to the fullest. Some argue that flora and fauna can be found online, but seeing a picture is different, almost cheating, compared to being beside the plant, able to study it from all angles rather than in an unmoving form. The experience is not the same. Also, computers are indoors, so the true world is chielded from view. Even nowadays with laptops if one was to be brought outside, the user would be focusing on the screen, not what is around them. Computers have severely cut down on the admiration of nature. Even family and friends suffer when computers are around. Many people barely pay attention to conversation while focusing on the screen. They tend to onlypretend to listen half the time. Even when chatting with friends online, the conversation is disjointed because attention is probably focused on another part of the internet. Frequently, during conversations without a computer nearby, the mind is focused on something from earlier that day. Relationships are suffering, and computers are at fault. Computers are sucking in society, more of it each day. Much of what is done on computers, like the study of faraway places, can easily be found in books. Computers have resulted in a lack of exercise, less time with nature, strained relationships, and a generally unhealthy lifestyle. Through all of this, they have returned little to society. Why does the world continue to put up with computers and their negative effect on humanity?",12
614,"Dear editor, computers are good for people because it really helps with they work and home work and other stuff.",2
615,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I feel that computers are a great in most people lives. One you can use them for almost everything. two computers are good for you in many ways. It shouldnt affect dailey schedule or just being with your family. People can use computers for almost everything for one their are hundred of websites on the computer. For example, you can play games all different kinds, you can also chat with people, litsen to music, watch videos, look for places and a whole lot more. Computers are very useful in many different ways. Computers are also good for you. They help with you eye cordination. You can also go online and do practice on math, social studies, etc. The internet also has a lot of eduacting games whiten is good for people who had that extra help. It also helps you with you hand cordinations because on the computer you need to know how to type. you get realy good at it you can type without looking. A computer can not get between you dailey schedule or whay u do with your family. Because a computer is a computer you go on it if you need something or you go on it just for fun for example i havea computer at my house and someone goes on it everyday and it never affect what everybody does us kids still go to school my parents still go to work, we eat dinner together we do what we have to do, and the computer never gets in the way. As my conclusion i know that computers are good to have in peoples houses. One you can use them for almost everything. Two computers are good for you. Three i shouldnt affect your daily schedule in anyway.",7
616,"Do you remember the last time you locked something up on the computer? Many people use Computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support a trances in technology believe that computer have a positive effect on people. I support computers because they help with writing, locking up information and provide communication. One reason I support computers is because they help with writing. You can tell I do not have the greatest hand writing. To help this, I type almost all of my papers. Computers can also help people with spelling and gramar. There are even systems now that let you say something and @CAPS1 will appear on the screen. This is just one reason I support computers. Next, computers are benifical because of the information they can provide. ""before computers you would need to go to the libary and find around ten books that might not even have what your looking for. Now you can find hundreds of articals on any topic in minutes. The amount of information out there is un imageinable. I think computers are a great of technology because of the information they can provide. Finally, I believe computer are a benifit to us because of comunication. One term of communication that came out recently is @CAPS2. @CAPS1 is a website that let's you sent messages to a friend, share picture, videos and many more things. E-mail let's you send letters to people via internet instantly. I could go on forever about forms of comunication on the internet. This is the last reason I support computers. Computers are a great benifit to society. They help with writing, communication, and everyone could benifit form computers.",8
617,"Dear @CAPS1 post, Computers are an advance in technology, in a good way. They do benifit are society grately. Its a way that family members can keep in touch, it makes your life easier booking a flight and keeping a flight and tastly they help kids with school work. They can bring people together. Firstly, they are a great way to keep in touch. In my own expierence I have a brother at college and when I miss him or need to talk to him I can always send him an email or vidoe chat with him. Do you have someone, you don't get to see everyday? It can really make your family closer, because you talk more, with your realitives, and with friends. Friends more and go away but you can always chat it you need them. In a time of pain all you want is a friend. When the friends away, a computer probably helped our, too, just getting there. Booking plans without a computer would be a hasal, waitting on the phone for hours, at end, with computers you can do it all in all about five minutes. I have had a expierence when my plane was canceless but didn't know until, she went on the computer and checked. So she just switche are flight and we were off but could you imagine going the next day to find out that your flight was canceled and try all day to get on a flight and might not. With computers you can check every hour on the hour if you like. It well even say if there delayed so you don't wait in the airport for five hours. When it comes to traveling computers are a hesasity. Has that ever happened to you? Most likly. Yes once you were happy you had a computer. On the other hand, it also helps with your education. When class is over and your teacher is trying to scramble to get the homework out, mostly no ones listioning all they want to do is scat. About nine out or ten kids won't know the assignment when they get home that night. I know thats happened to me. As a eighth grader you probably did the of just forgeting all about and just taking the concerned. You could use your computer. Most schools use some or device, here at @CAPS2 he have were all are teachers post, grades, test/quizs coming up and homework. It's just one click away from every thing we need. It all right there, together. Most @CAPS3 kuchers will be a let happier if their kids come, in with there homework then without. Wouldn't you be? From school fund raisers to the lunch menu its all there. In conclusion, computers do help us from everyday use. to special uses. It helps use make are family stronger, help us keep are flight out and help us get homework, for school the next day. Computers are a help to the society, in a great and convienent way.",10
618,"Dear newspaper, I feel as though internet or computers act as an advantage in sosiety rather than a problem. They help with school work, like projects or email. You can even take college online now! People also use the internet for media or to simply catch up with friends. One of the most important reasons to have a computer is for school orenented reasons. Like having a project that you need to get notes for or making a power poin presentation. One other great reson is for the teachers. There computers can help them teach a class in a way that is both fun and easy to undersand. The new uprizing in computer use has brought about new ways of getting a college degree. Now you even just simply get in bed turn on your lap top and take college classes right on your computer! I dont know about you guy's but I'd much rather take college in the own comfort of my home then drive to a campus all the time. Another great use for the internet is e-mail to e-mail makes our lives a lot easier now that more people use it. It can send us school starts like a early dismiste or a way to catch up with old highschool frends. Another great reson for the internet is for mention or just to have fun and relax. @PERCENT1 of people that have computers use them for media or fun reasons, like gamelry, or to go on to youtube. Please add this article into your news paper so that the computer can be put out there as a helping add, and not something that is going to make the whole world obise because thats not just from computers. Its the people who use computers, felt that they dont get exercise not the computers. So why put them out in a bad way.",8
619,"Dear newspaper, I think that using your computer too much is bad. Some people spend way too much time on the internet. Many people are too focused on the internet and they lack on their normal activities. Also, the computer is bad for people because they will be on the internet all night and get no sleep. This leaves them exausted for the day ahead. Alot of people spend too much time on the internet. Since they are always on the internet, they don't spend alot of time with their families. This causes the internet addicted person to lose relationships with their family and friends. Not exercizing is a result of this addiction also. For example, my stepbrother is always on the internet now. He doesn't talk to anyone because he is so preoccupied with his game. Another problem people encounter with the internet is being too focused. When you are too focused on the internet, you forget there is a whole world out there that needs your help, most people won't do their choires, or make a meal for their family. These people also have no time for their outdoor activities they used to enjoy. Internet addicts usually don't get any sleep. They have no time to study at night because they spend all their extra time on the internet. During the day, they will be very tired in school or work and the internet will be the one to blame. Last month my mom made a facebook. She is constantly on it. When she is on she ignores everything around her. My mom goes to school and she tells me how she never has time to study because she always on the internet. She also stopped reading the bible in her spare time to go on the internet. The internet is a bad thing to get hooked on. You lose relationships with your friends and family because you never get off the computer. People usually don't exercize or do thier chores. This is not a very good addiction to get into.",8
620,"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a lot of effect on people @CAPS1 their not getting the exercis they need coz there just exercising there fingers. And while there at the computer there not looking at nothing else but the screen and thats not good for anyones health if there just looking at a computer screen the hole time. Another reason why i think at affects people @CAPS1 there not eatin wat they need to eat there just eatin something quick like junck food so they could on the computer. All are this effect stay on the @CAPS1 people either go places or have atheres might not be going out time their effects need to",5
621,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 don't have an affect on people because you can play games, webchat, and watch hilarious videos on the computers. Also, you can use the computers for a research project or you can use the @CAPS2 for some facts on @CAPS3 people like @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and @LOCATION1. Also, who would want to get of their @CAPS2 and exercise, exercising is so boring and lame. Second, who would like to especially enjoy the nature, walking through the woulds is so boring, you'll be walking through mud, ticks will be all over body, mosquitoes will try and bite you when you sweat. When kids get older, they mostly don't want to interact or spend time with their family, they want to spend time with their friends everyday. Also, they mostly want to use technology to. Kids will spend time texting on their cellphones when they're not in the mood for calling. Thirdly, computers do give you hand-eye coordination it teaches you how to type without looking down at the keyboard. Computers also teach you how to set you fingers on the home row for the keyboard. Finally, @CAPS2 really do benefit society because you can use this technology in middle school, high school, and through college. When you get older you'll be learning more about these kinds of technology. Also, kids could teach their parents how to use computers if their parents don't know how to. Teaching you parents how to use @CAPS2 is a great responsibility for your actions.",8
622,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1! Get off that computer it is @TIME1. But mom I don’t want to im in the middle of a game. Does that conbersation sound familiar? Of course it does. Every kid likes to play on the computer. However, noticing your kid being on the computer @NUM1 is not a good thing. In this matter experts are definatley @PERCENT1 right because kids and adults are spending too much time on the computer. These people can do other things like excersising more, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. Spending too much time on the computer is not healthy. On the other hand, if someone kicks you of the computer you can always get that six pack you wanted. There are three main things that can get you in shape. First, taking a light run every night on your community track can get your legs from being fatigued every time you walk up the stairs to having your legs be firm and able to run lap after lap just for a warm up. Every years my dad takes me to the track in @DATE1 and times me for @NUM2 and @NUM3 yard dash, the @NUM4 meter, and the mile. Between the months I train all the way up to @DATE2 then my dad does another assment. I do this training because I play baseball. Weight lifting is another way to get in shape. Some basic excersises are bench pressing, squating, and dumbell curles. There are more challenging excersise but I won't go into that. Once you feel like your in shape, take all of that trainign and put it into a sport. Excersising is not the only thing you can do. Enjoying nature is another option. Just go outside if someone kicks you off your computer. Absoarb everything about the nature. From the squirrls to the tress. If you are in the winter enjoy the snow instedid of being inside @NUM1 playing computer games. But, if that doesn't work out for you then hangout with your family. Hanging out with your family can be thing you can do. Gather your family and plan a trip. You can go to a baseball game, park, or movies anything that will get you away from that computer. That is my opinion why I think people should get excersise, enjoy nature, and spend time with their families insted of being on the computer @NUM1.",8
623,"My opinion is that the more that we stay on the computer. The more we get lazy. One reason that I say this is because, a computer is a big handy person in reality. Second reason is, people stay in the house sitting down on the computer other than exercising. The third reason is, people just sit in the house, and an't enjoy fresh air with their loved ones. First, the reason why I say a computer is a big handy person because it does most of the things a human can do. That can lead a person to being very lazy. Just too sit in the house and go to websites. It has a big effect on a humans life. The computer technology have contecll over a huge population of recae. It really make miss out on half of their day. Second, people stay in the house on the computer other than exercising. It's very unhealthy for a person to sit down at a computer all day. The person has to eat so, basicly they eat and sit back down at the computer. It can get out hand because the computer allows people to grace food online. So that right there is an example of people not getting ecersise, and being lazy. You need to get your ecersise dayly. So people that doesnt get their ecersise need to start. Instead of sitting down on the computer all day. Third, many people over whole world have a lot of love one's that they care about and love. ""But"" they dnt get time to be with them, because they are always on the computer. The computer shouldn't take you away from you outdoor life. Okay, so what you can talk fo your friend and family over the computer. It's never like seeing them in person. Go outside and have fun and happy memories with your family. Because the computer is just words being texted. It's nothing like being said. I garrented you that. If you spend time with youre family then you will want to do it again. While your going out excersise and be interacting. In conclusion, if you are allways on the compute that's not good. Just take a few hours out of the day and ecersise. Go out and have a marvelous day. Because the computer doesn't do nothing but make you lazirer (@CAPS1 YOU). If your allways on the computer just be sure that you get your ecersise and your time with your family. It will make your a better person!",8
624,"Dear newspaper, I disagree with you about computers. I think that computers are helpful with projects, homework, or letters. For example you can use a computer to help you with projects, if you have a project to do and you don't feel like going to the library, you can use a compater to look up information on just about anything. And you don't have to draw pictures, that's what printers are for. Also when you have homework most kids or teenagers, even adults don't like doing homework, thats what a computer do for you can just look up the anser online and then your done in no time. Let's say you have to write a essay I know nobody likes to write essay's by hand you can type @CAPS1 and design @CAPS1 with your own designs and make @CAPS1 look nicer than you writing @CAPS1. Further more I know nobody likes to keep up with and if you lose @CAPS1 then you have to start over and that takes forever to do especially if @CAPS1's due the next day, you get bored and you don't feel like writing @CAPS1 over and you get mad because you already did @CAPS1. And when you had @CAPS1 in you mysteriously find you other paper that you finished and lost and @CAPS1 makes you so angry. And then you have to worry about if someone store @CAPS1 and copied @CAPS1 and put their name on the copied one but changed some of your ideas around so that they wouldn't lose major points and grade drops from a @CAPS2 to a @CAPS3 in no time flat. Lastly you can use a computer write finds of letters. You can write a that and people's report card's if your a teacher, and you can also write a letter to friend that mights have moved away. Therefore the types of letters you should be writing are love letters to yor wife or girlfriend at work or in school and @CAPS1 fast too instead of writing @CAPS1 and then you hards start to the worst kind of way. So instead you can write @CAPS1 fast and they get @CAPS1 fast if they have computer but if they work at a school then they can get because every school should have a computer so they'll be able to get @CAPS1. Another kind of letter you can write is a letter to your friend that you haven't seen in years or that has moved to another country or to another state so I hope now I have convinced you about why @CAPS1 is @CAPS4 to have a computer but as you sad @CAPS1 itsn't always @CAPS4 to be on the computer @NUM1 but once in a while @CAPS1 okay especially in an emergency if someone has just died in your family and you don't know how to get there use a gas, and if you don't have a gas go online and print out the directions so that you can get their and see which family member died and if you knew that so now that you know the importance of a computer. I hope you use @CAPS1 wisey.",9
625,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are one of the most useful things that we can have. First, computers are good for communicating. Students @MONTH1 contact teachers through email if they have a question about an assignment. Computers also are useful for teaching. People use the @CAPS2 everyday to get information on their favorite sports teams or on a new recipe they saw on television. Finally, computers help us get work done easier. Student and employees use @ORGANIZATION1 for everything from writing a paper to creating a presentation. Futhermore, computers are extremely essential to our everyday life because they help us communicate, learn and finish work. Every year, thousands of students go to college, and thousands of families move away from each other. Computers are one way of communicating to @CAPS8 loved ones in far away places. Parents send messages via email to their children at college. Families speak with each other through @CAPS3. Computers are what makes all this possible. Not only can we use computers to make contact with our families,but we can also use them to speak with our teachers. Whenever a student is sick, but wants to get their homework finished, they look on their teacher's website. Here, all the homework for the class is listed. Also, if a student has a paper due the @DATE1, but their printer is broken, they @MONTH1 email the paper to the teacher. This allows the student to get full credit for their work. Email is not onlyuseful for handing in projects, but also for asking questions about the assignments. If a student has a question about an assignment, he or she can ask a friend or the teacher. Then, the student will be able to successfully complete the project. Computers are one of the most useful ways of making contact today, but communication is not the computer's only purpose. The average person goes on the @CAPS2 ten times a @DATE1 just to get information. Computers provide a pletvera of knowledge for people's use. Search engines like @ORGANIZATION3 or yahoo provide answers in less than one second. This is much faster than going in the library and spending an hour looking it up. Website text is not the anything that provides information far eager learners @CAPS5 also provide pictures to further the persons understanding about a topic. For example, if a person is living in the @LOCATION1, and has lived there all their life, but is reading an article on a website about an animal native to @LOCATION2, they would not know how to picture it in their head. Articles and books @MONTH1 provide a description, nut nothing really gives the person a solid picture. The person could go online and search for a picture, which they will surely find. Finally, computers keep the brain active. While searching on a website, a person could piece together information from different sites to create a better picture, and, therefore, have a more complete and thorough understanding. In order to do this, however, a person's brain must constantly working. This helps develop skills later on such as problem solving. Overall, computers are one of the most useful and common of the learning devices. Many people say that computers are useful. They agree this by saying that work gets done so much easier and faster on a computer. on average, computers complete work fifty times more efficiently than people do by hand. This is because of programs such as @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS8 programs allow people to cerrect spelling and grammatical mistakes while at the same time creating a neat looking presentation. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people with bad spelling or grammatical habits corrected @CAPS8 mistakes quickly through @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6. If people constantly make grammatical or spelling errors, then having them underlined in @CAPS6 will show them that this is not the correct way to punctuate or spell something in a sentence.",10
626,The effect's computers have on people is not resinable for children and other people. Computers are not good for people these day's because people are spleeling all there time' on the computer and are'nt realling that it miss up there eye's and some people are adicted to it. Now people are useing the computer like they are nutting. So people think that the computers aren't hurtful to there eye's the time people are speeling on the computer they can be speeling time with there family and friend. People helpful is on the line with this computer thing. People shouldn't be useing computers like they are because all day on the computer can mess up your eyes and that's what people are not understand there day. I think that it should be a limeit for when people go on the computers.,5
627,"Dear local Newspaper, I think that computers have a exellent benefit for people. First family friends can communicate from a far distance. Secondly typing on the computer gives people good hand and eye cordnation. Thirdly they give people the ability to learn about faraway places. Lastly it gives student a chance to research a topic they are learning about. Well @CAPS1 do you think? Researcher @PERSON1 said that almost @PERCENT1 of family's live faraway from eachother. computers give the ability for familys to communicate wether its aim or a webcam chat. Also out of the @PERCENT1 of familys that live faraway from each other @PERCENT2 use the computer to comunicate. Hand and eye cordination, some people type without looking and some people are really slow. Typing on a computer give the great hand and eye cordination. Good hand and eye cordination could be used for many things. For example, playing sports or even a simple task like throwing something in the trash. Lastly, have you ever wanted to learn about a place faraway from you live or have you ever researched a topic for school? Well I have. Computer give people the ability to learn about places faraway. For example in the third grade I had to research hammer head sharks. Don't teacher always ask their student to look up a word or a topic on the computer? As I have said before I think computers have a benifit on people. I hope that my three reasons of contacting family and friend and hand and eye cordnation and lastly researching has made you think it a good thing too. Thank you for taking time to read @CAPS1 I had to say and I hope you take it into concideration.",8
628,"Dear editor, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I believe that computers are a benefit to the world, and people as well. I say this because lots of people can talk to family of friends long distance. Also the computer can teach you lots of thing. Finally it makes you more social. In @CAPS1 strong opinion computers are better for the world. Firstly, many people can talk long distance with family of friends. You have web cam and that allows you to chat and see the person. Also @CAPS2 is another site where you can talk to friends and then you can have a lot and put pictures of yourself and even videos, even though you can talk on the phone and do all this but on the phone it costs money for a plan. When you use a computer it is completely free. Secondly, the computer teaches you things that help you later on in life, and it let's you know things as well. The computer people made programs that can computers and more really cool. The programs teach you how to type, it is called type to learn or type for fun. Also they have programs that let you know how to read. It is great for kids because they need to know these things any ways. Finally, the computer makes you more social. This is because you have @CAPS2 and it let's you know things that happen in school or out of school. You can talk to people on @CAPS2 or email each other and have a conversation with them. You can also meet new people from other places and have a good relationship with them. You have friends with and know who they are and won't need to figure it out. So, this is why I believe that having a computer is a good idea, and good to have. You can talk to people long distance. The computer teaches you things for life. Finally it makes you more social with people. So in @CAPS1 strong opinion it is a good idea to have a computer.",8
629,"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing you this letter to give you my opinion on computer use. In my opinion, I think that some people use and rely on computers too much. Wether it be for a research project, talking to friends, and even answers for homework. Everyday millions of people are on the computer for hours straight. Moving your fingers doesnt count as exercise and it wastes energy. Many people I know would die if they didn't have a computer because friends are on or made because they need if for homework. These type of people need to be taught how to get things done withou technology because are day it might fail. Some students rely on there technology to work orthey will fail. These children need to be taught that there is other ways to do things. Like hanging out with friends, reading a book, and even doing their homework. Since students rely on their computers so much then always on them. Every day people I know go home and jump on @CAPS2 for the rest of the day. They never can do anything like going outside and doing sports. Many kids do not do any type of athletic sport. Obessity is a huge problem in the @LOCATION1 are the numbers keep increasing drasticlly. Everyone thinks that it is beging caused by bad eating habbits, thats only half of it. People overusing their computer is also a big problem. Children around the @LOCATION1 are stuck on their computers all day checking message, and seting up pictures. While these children are on the comptuer they dont even think they just chow down on ""@CAPS3"". This comptuer usage problem is beging to become at bigdeal with the obessity and hold much people rely on it for basically everything. So we need to be the first people to stop this befor it forms bad. This could be a huge problem in the future. So lets start to cut our usage time down now.",8
630,"Computers are not having a negative affect on society. In fac when you talk with someone online @CAPS1 helps build relationship within that person. A use for computer that is also use full is hand eye coordination. Education is also a useful thing you can use with computers. You can learn about faraway places and monuments. The myth is that computers ruin relationship between friends and family however, In some ways @CAPS1 improves them, when you go on skype you talk with some one online. By doing this you actually improve the bone between you and that person. This information proves that computers can actually suport replationships. Hand eye coordination is also something useful that a computer an teach when you type on keyboard your fingers inprove on reflectsel. If you continue to type your hand eye coordination will improve. Some people might say that a computer won't help you much @CAPS1 really is possitive to use @CAPS1. A computer is more educational than what most people would think. On certain websites you can see something that can teach you. If you go on a historian websites that someone could learn about different typs of people. Lots of critics say that a computer is not educational. However when you look at the facts a computer can teach a lot. @CAPS1 is easy to belive a computer is not a good thing. But when someone looks at the facts A computer is a great thing to own. If critics acna take these facts into consideration a computer is a better object than what most people say.",8
631,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers play a huge role in society. Many adults and children spend a lot of time on a computer every day and I think that is bad. Instead of being on computers, I think it would be best to spend time with your family. Exercising and enjoying the outdoors is also a good time consuming activity to do. Studying, school work, and jobs are also important things people should be doing instead of being on the computer so much. Family is very important in life and some people take advantage of it. Instead of being on the computer all day, spending home with family and doing activities with them could be more fun. For example, most teenagers come home from school and go on this computer to talk to friends or play games instead of talking with this parents about this day or anything. By spending time with family you not only learn more about them but you can become closer and be able to talk with them about anything. Nature is a beautiful thing. Sure you can see pictures of nature on the internet, but! is is not the same as the actual thing. By outside, and enjoying nature, taking walks, runs, or even hikes, you can get your exercise. Exercising is a very important thing in a persons life, because you need to be fit to be healthy, and by being on a computer all the would happen. Adults, and even some teenagers have jobs in. While some jobs involve computers, most do not. No one can get in job by spending all day on the computer playing games. I talking to people. Teenagers well and do while playing game talking to. Computer are all the time. There are plenty of important activities, such as, spending time with family, enjoying nature, and school work and jobs. Computer are not necisity. We lives, so I think use should using them",8
632,"To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are a benefit to our society. These computers are an advantage to our learning and knowledge. By using computers students can get there work done quicker and more efisent. While typing your report on the computer you might spell a word wrong well every computers has spell check. Also you @ORGANIZATION1 need to look up a word because you don't know the deffinition all you have to do si go to @LOCATION1 and type in the word and automatically you have the deffinition. You @ORGANIZATION1 have been given a book report so you can go online and copy and paste @CAPS2 do @CAPS2 no @CAPS2 want let you but @CAPS2 you had a piece of paper and your pen you could write @CAPS2 down. A computer has made the life of a school student so much easier. You @ORGANIZATION1 need a job but cant stand, walk, talk well you could get a job working on a computer. Computers allowed more jobs to be made and replaced. Without a computer how would teachers get mail sent to them without wasting paper. Sure a computer uses electrisity but paper wastes trees. Anyway you think about @CAPS2 the computer is a good thing to invest in. Going to college not everyone has enough time in a day to drive to school, well with your computer you can go to school right online. So if you don't have money to by a back pack you don't need one your mates stay right where you left them. So a computer is a good invention. @CAPS2 has made life quicker, eco friendly and even has saved trees. On the brightside @CAPS2 has even produced many jobs. Last minute things can even be online. Each computer bought has given someone else a new expense.",8
633,"Dear @CAPS1 local @CAPS2, I think that computers are on positive effect on people. @CAPS6 you think that there positive on people? Well I'll give you @NUM1 reasons why you should say ""@CAPS8"" @NUM2) teaches hand-eye coordination @NUM3) abiliy to learn and get your @CAPS3 online @NUM1) you can talk to people all of the world. These are @CAPS1 @NUM1 reasons. @CAPS1 first reason is hand-eye coordination. If you have hand-eye coordination, you can @CAPS6 anything. This can help you get a job and even help with a sport you like. Having hand-eye coordination is important because were in @DATE1 everything goes around by computer and cell phones. This is @CAPS1 first reason. @CAPS1 second reason, how the computer can teach people things. The internet has a lot of web sites about how to get your @CAPS3 online. And you can take online classes. There is a @PERCENT1 drop-out rate and @PERCENT2 of those kid don't have there @CAPS3, so they go online to take there classes. The computer can really help you. This is @CAPS1 second reason. Finally, people go online to chat rooms to talk and met new people. Meeting new people is a good thing to @CAPS6. You can learn about where and how the person lives. Chats rooms are cool to. You can go online and talk to your friends without wasteding your phone minutes. The computer can help in many ways. @CAPS1 last reason. OK, I'm done but @CAPS6 you remember that question I asked you? (@CAPS6 you the computers are a positive effect on people?) @CAPS7 @CAPS6 you think? I hope you say "" @CAPS8, they are an positive effect "". But any ways those are @CAPS1 @NUM1 reasons why. P.S. I hope you go out and buy a computer after reading this!! ",8
634,"I think computers have a good effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordiantion, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and allow them to talk online with other people. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. This will be used through out people lives. WIthout hand-eye coordination people will be clumsey. Hand-eye coordination is used from day to day everyday. Using a computer you have to look at the screen and type at the same time. For people who do not have good hand-eye coordiantion this will be a big help. They will be able to do more thing without messing up. Like hitting a baseball! For kids who want to play sports this could acually help. They will learn to use there eyes, arms, and hands to there advantage. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places. If we did not have this ability we will not be able to know what is going on around the world. Also if you have family in a faraway place you will be able to look online and see what is happening there. If something bad has happened you will know this and will be able to help them. Also to be able to learn about faraway places will help in school. If you have a report to do on of faraway place instead of looking through you can look on the internet for information. Computers also allow people to talk online with other people. This gives more comunication. You will be able to make more friends and better friends. To have the opportuniy to talk to people online is great. You can learn about someone and become friends and hang out a lot. Also you will become a lot more interactive with people. If you are a shy person this can help you. You will get used to talking to people and when you get comfortable you will talk to them in real life. This will make you a lot more friends. This will help you come out of your shell and become a lot more interactive around people. These are three reasons why I think computers are a good thing. They help hand-eye coordination give the ability to learn about faraway places and allow you to talk online with other people.",8
635,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever wondered what effect computers have on people? It is a very negative effect. Computers are one of the main reasons of why kids do not exercise and become obese, it can effect students' grades, and by being on the @CAPS6, you are isolating yourself from your loved ones. First of all, more and more kids are using computers way more often than they should. The result of this, you @MONTH1 ask? Since computers are used daily, especially by young adolescents, it is likely for that child to become obese. Researches from well-known colleges, such as @ORGANIZATION2 and @LOCATION2, discovered that @PERCENT1 of kids who spend more than two hours on the @CAPS6 are obese or will become heavier when they are older. After speaking with @PERSON1, graduate from @LOCATION1, he told me that when children spend more time on the @CAPS6, they are doing nothing but staring at a bright screen that can damage their eyes, and not spending their time outside enjoying the beautiful weather. As a consequence, kids start to gain body fat from sitting on a coach staring at the @CAPS6 all day instead of exercising! My second reason of why computers are a negative effects on kids is that it can harm your grades! After I spoke with a current student at @ORGANIZATION1, she told me that the reason why her grades drop is because she is too busy on @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc. She does not focus on her @ORGANIZATION1 work like she should and because she doesn't, her grades go from @NUM1's to low @NUM2's. This shows that even ""A"" students are getting bad grades from being on the @CAPS6. Additionally, from being on the @CAPS6 so much and not paying attention at @ORGANIZATION1 work, it can effect your best grades on the @ORGANIZATION3's! This shows that by always going on the @CAPS6 you hurt your academic skills. My last and final reason of why computers have a negative effect on children is because it harms your social skills of being on outgoing, talkative individual! Everytime you log into that death trap device, your selfesteem becomes lower because you never talk to friends or call them. You just sit on a hard chair, looking at an electronics device that is going to take you no where in life. Also, you are pushing your loved ones away by being on @CAPS6 @NUM3. You will end up never spend time with them and you will never call your friends to see what they are up to if you keep on going on the @CAPS6. Furthermore, if your mom or dad tells you to get off your @CAPS6, you become cranky and rude to your family just becuase you want to go back on your favorite electronic device. Do you really want to act that way to your family? So, in summing up, computers are a negative effect on many young individuals, and the reasons for this are that you have less time to exercise, it harms your grades, and you are not able to be as interactive with people by being on the @CAPS6. The real question is, though, is do you think computers have a negative or positive effect on people?",10
636,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A resent concern has built up among experts that computers @MONTH1 have negitive affects on the society. I do not agree with this. Computers ease life, teach you about faraway places and people, and finaly you can chat with others. I belive computers can only benifit a society. As previously mentioned, computers ease the hassels of life. With computers you are able to plan your life with @CAPS1 output. This program ables you to enter data on places you have to go and reminds you when time is done to that event. With this program you will never forget where you have to go. Also, with the computer you are able to gather information at extreamly high speeds. Supose you are doing a research project in school on types of cars, you just enter cars on @ORGANIZATION3 and get millions of results. this save much time than going on the librery and finding a book. This can take up to on how . Finally, with a couputer handy there are programs for special needs people to wright. New programs such as @ORGANIZATION2 word have a special function called voice commands. This lets a person who can not wright because of blindness or a disability speek to the computer what he or she wants to wright. In an istant it will pop up on the screen. Computer ease peples' lifes jarasticly. Besides esing lifes, computers teach you about far away places and people. pictures on a computer give one a first hand acount of how a far away place is like. Insead of just reading about it you can see it. Acording to time magazine if a person sees a place they will learn more by @PERCENT1 than reading an encyclopedia. As well as pictures, blogs give people an idea of how a person lives in a regular day in that place and how they feel about it. This is another first hand acount of the place. Finally, ebooks on the internet give you a large amount of information. Ebooks are books but in an internet format. These books inclued encyclopedias that give statistics and, pores, and events that are in the far of place. For example if you are planning a trip you can learn where to eat and where to get entertained. you can learn about far of places and people in them with computers. Lastly, with computers you can talk to people around the world. you can talk to friends. Have you ever moved and wanted to talk to a friend from where you previously lived? Now you can esily do so with video chat. Not ownly can you talk to someone you can see them. i remember @NUM1 years ago when I moved to @LOCATION1, I mised my friends in @LOCATION2 so i video chted them. As well as talking to friends, one can have a bussness meating around the world with out having to traval out of your town. For example if a company wanted to make a trading agreement with another company in @LOCATION3 they could do so with a click of a mouse. This will save time and money of travaling. Also you can talk to others online to get a feel of what happened. For example @CAPS2 a few weeks ago, video chated many people in @LOCATION4 to undersand now bad conditions were after earth quake. You can talk to people with ease with an computer availible. In conclusion, I believe computer are benifical to a society. They ease life, teach people about far away places and the people who live there, and alow people to talk to others. Computers open doors in the world. Computers help the society a great deal.",12
637,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 tired, lazy people sitting on their computer and wasting their life bacause of it. The issue to with is do you think that people are spending to much time on the computer or not. I strongly believe that people are spending to much time on the computer. And, here are @CAPS2 reasons why, people are spending less time exercising, people not enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. Without a doubt you probably know that exercising is at least somewhat helpful to life, @CAPS4 if people are sitting home @NUM1 on the computer with no exercise, it is going to cause people to gain an excess amount of wait. Because the more they just sit around. And do nothing except the computer. The more they're going to be and the more lazy they're going to be. So they're not going to want to do anything and really it's just a waist of life. And, in some cases it can cause depression. Just ask a local resident who says "" @CAPS2 mom used to be on the computer all the time and did nothing with her life,"" and @CAPS3 she became depressed. And, soon after, killed herself."" @CAPS3 more and more people are going to become like. I know that a lot of people like to be outside when its a nice sunny day. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 somebody on that day in a room, with their eyes to the computer screen. Because they cant think of anything else to do with their lives. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 if that was someone you loved. Doing that with their life. I'm pretty sure you would try to do something to help them get off that path. Just ask another local resident @PERSON1 who says, ""I remember coming home everyday, and there was @CAPS2 mom, no shades up, pitch block, it was like a dark cave, and she would sit there for hours on the computer wasting her life, and I remember asking her how long has it been since you've gone outside, she answered, its been almost two months."" @CAPS4 I know from @CAPS2 family that there was a family member of mine who was a ""computer junkie"" And, I remember at a family get together @CAPS2 aunt was the only one who could never come. Because she was to busy on the computer. And, she",8
638,"Dear @LOCATION1, I think the way how more and more people use computers are bad because, @NUM1 int's not good for people's health, @NUM2 people who use computers lots of times, refuse to spend time with family and friends and @NUM3 you can find more about something that's on a computer by going and studying it yourself. My first reason why computers have bad effects on people who use computers, is the health issue. Health in very important but sitting in front of a computer for hours makes matters worst. By the way you hunch your back in order to see something small on the computer creen, or when you hold on the mouse, waiting to click onm something for long period of time, can cause arthrities. My second reason why computers have bad effects on people who use them. Are that people who are on computers & end to sometimes refuse to spend time with family or friends like for example: @CAPS1 say a week ago you made a promise to have a family get together with the family, and they all count on you to come, @CAPS2 you get a computers, you go on all these neat websites that you never heard off it's amazing right! WRONG! before you know if, it's the day for the family get together and your line an hour @CAPS4 you amke excuse not to come. And that breaks you family's heat....My last reason why, to me computers are a bad idea is you can learn about another the computer by going on to a But its ore fun traveling or meeting people from that place @CAPS2 setting in a for and having your neck, back and sore @CAPS3 I right, I think I @CAPS3. Also idsfun to and ear foods from the culture that you fing cool off that lame computers.(To me that sounds like a good time to invite family and friends!) @CAPS4 therefore in conclusion, in my personal opinion computers have bad effects of people health, it can cause later bacj and neck problems maybe even activities. People who use computers a lot or love to spend time on computers refuse to spend time with family and friends, and @NUM3 You can find more about something like a culture or land, if you go and study its yourself instead of going on a computers for hours. I hope my opinion convinces others, hoe computers have bad effects on people who use it a lott, and take action into their own hands and do what is right.",8
639,"Dear Local Newspaper, I must admit that the experts are centainly right cause I know people that stay on the computer all day and that’s really not good if you ask me. Instead of being on computers learning about faraway places, and talking to other people, you should go exercising, you should relax, and you should interact with family and friends. Exercising is much more better than being on a computer, and I say that to say this. When your on a computer just sitting there playing online games and checking other things out, or whatever the case @MONTH1 be, you get board, and hungry, and I know theres some snacks around you while your doing whatever your doing. Instead of being on a computer for @NUM1 or @NUM2 hours or maybe even all day getting fat. There are many ways you can exercise. You can take walks, you can go joggin, you could play a sport, I mean there are a lot of things you can do when your not on a computer. I know some people that could be workin all day and still come home to there computer. Rest is good also. You don't always have to jump on your computer, you could just relax watch a movie, eat some pop corn and just enjoy yourself, you could even take a nap for a little while or something but you don't always have to get straight on your computer if you really don't have to use it. The way I see it is family, and computers are always going to be there but at the same time which one is more important. Friends aren't always dependable so you really don't need them around only a selected few, but thats not the point. Both family, and your true friends have feelings, and if your not spending time with them over a computer that your gonna have when you leave, and come back home too something isn't right. Tomorrow isn't promised, we live for today. So enjoy life while you got the chance, and spend time doing something active, with family and friends, and if your really into computers, try to balance your time out.",8
640,"Dear @CAPS1: Some people believe computers benefit society. However, others feel they are too consuming. I for me I belive computers help society. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, give people, and even allows computer to chat online with other people. I'd bet your job requires you to use a computer, you probably even have a personal computer which you like to use to chat with friends. I do that all the time and I like it. Another thing I like are sports. One of my favorite sports is softball. In softball you need to have hand-eye cordination, this will help you swing at the ball more accuratly. When a pitcher throws the ball you have to had the bat at the right angle and watch the ball to know when to swing if kids used computers and become good at hand-eye cordination, then possibly more kids would join a local sports team, and possibly even join travel team. Do you like to travel? I do, and are why I learn about places before I go is by looking that particular place up on the internet. About three years ago I went on vacation to @LOCATION1. I wanted to know what it was like there because I had never gone before, so when I looked it up I found out that they had many torist attractions and ""packages"" that let you swim with dolphins, I was very excited to go and when I did, I had a biast, and to think if I didn't look it up I would not have known what kinds of fun things they had! No wonder so many people like computers! One of the biggest reasons why I like computers is because I can chat with my friends online one main attraction online is @CAPS2, everybody, primarily, has one. Some people have one because they like to look at pictures. I have one because I like to chat with my friends. One night I was chatting with a friend we were laughing having a great time, and then she reminded me that we had science homework due the very next day! I thanked her and then completed my work. You see if kids chat online their friends can remind them of important nescesitys such of homework. This could impove grades by @PERCENT1! So you now see why society needs computers and if you have forgotten let me remind you: computers teach you hand-eye cordiantion, let's you learn about faraway places and people, and now allows you to chat online. Just think what would society be like with no computers.",9
641,"Dear local newspaper, I think effects computers have on people are great learning skills/affects because they give us time to chat with friends/new people, helps us learn about the globe(astronomy) and keeps us out of troble! Thing about! Dont you think so? How would you feel if your teenager is always on the phone with friends! Do you ever time to chat with your friends or buisness partner about things. Well now - there's a new way to chat the computer, theirs plenty of sites on the internet to do so: @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, facebook, myspace ect. Just think now while your setting up meeting with your boss on the computer, your teenager is having fun on the phone not rushing to get off cause you want to use it. How did you learn about other countrys/states outside of yours? Well I have by computer/internet, it's a new way to learn about what going on in our time! You might think your child spends a lot of time on the computer, but ask them so question about the economy, sea floor spreading or even about the @DATE1's you'll be surprise at how much he/she knows. Believe it or not the computer is much interesting then in class all day reading out of books. If your child is home on your computer or at a local library, it's better than being out with friends being fresh, or being perpressured to doing something they know isnt right. You might not know where your child is, @CAPS2 forbidde in a hospital bed because of a drive-by. Rather than your child on the computer learning, chatting or just playing games, safe and sound in your home or community place. Now I hope you have reached a point to understand and agree with me, because computers can have great effects on you or child because it gives us time to chat with friends/new people, helps us learn about the globe and believe or not keeps us out of troble. Thank you for listening.",8
642,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think computers do benefit society because computers can do alot of things like teach you. Computers are very helpful now, mostly every thing gets done on it. The computer teaches good eye cordination, how to focus, and show you stuff you don't know about. Without an computer you really can't get any thing done or reddy. A computer can be helpful for lots of things like job aplications of taxe's, or at a grocry store register, typeing and being on the computer is exercising but not for your body. When your on a computer exercise your hand's and your brains. With out computers you really cant do any thing. Mostly everything you do in life have to deal with some type of computer. I think that the people that said they shouldnt be on the computer is wrong because they can interact with there family that's far away thats also on the. You can enjoy nature by just takeing a look old you don't have to walkt out. Thats why I think computers are positive and helpful.",6
643,"Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that computers benifit the society. Computers help use in many ways but the @NUM1 main reasons are they help us store important documents get better at or learn forein language and get information. So without further adue here is more extensive reasonings. First of all, computers help us store many documents without computers companies that involve autioning and many other thing would have to store everything in filing cabinets. That would take forever and there wouldn't be enough room, so a lot of files would @CAPS1 be laying around every where @CAPS1 think about it. You use computers to make store send your newpaper articles and without computers you wouldn't be able to keep everybody up to date. Secondly they help use learn on get better at forien languages. Computers help use learn what other people are saying in other countries around the world. Like I have grandmother she the learned spanish. Now I can talk to her and she can understand me. Finally computers help use get information. They help us get information for a project at school, records direction, etc. In the year @DATE1 people din't have computers but when the first router was made the people I went up @NUM2 points. Farmers became slaves became very rich and I kid even grad collage at age @NUM3. So before you say people are spending too much fine on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends think about what computers do for us @CAPS1 think. So furher more computers benifit us a lot. There's storing deviced helping us get better a lot learning a forign language and getting information. So please make te right chose and think about what computers do for us. ",11
644,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you know that @NUM1 in every @NUM2 @CAPS2 families own a computer? Computers can be helpful if you need to write an essay for school, but when it comes to family vs. computer the average kid will usually pick the computer. Computers are taking away family time, exercise privledges, and time spent on school on school work. ""@PERSON3, get off the computer and come play '@CAPS3' with us!"" @CAPS4 mom's will say this to childeren at least once as week, the answer that is @CAPS4 common is ""@CAPS5!"" @CAPS6 childeren from the ages of @NUM3 to @NUM4 would rather spend time on the computer weather it's playing games or talking with friends. This is on issue that needs attention. Families should start to spend more time together instead of hanging out in front of a screen. My friend @PERSON1 has a little brother that is always playing games on the computer. Whenever @PERSON1 wants to play hide and go seek with him he always finds a way out of playing with @PERSON1 play computer. Aport from spending time with family computers take away @CAPS6 kids exercise privlidges. One example is that last week it snowed and I wanted my neigbor @PERSON2 to come outside and have a snowball fight with me but, she said had to finish a level on a computer game and it was realy important. This proves that it takes away time outside alone with exercise. A walk in the park with friends sounds relaxing to @CAPS4 people except for @CAPS4 teenagers would rather talk to their friends using a computer instead of actualy spending time with them. Lastly if time is being spent staring at a screen. When does homework got done? I took a survey recently among the eighth grade and the results showed that @PERCENT1 of the people that don't do their homework are due to spending too much time on the computer. In my science class a boy named @CAPS7 never does his homework. I asked him why one day and he says it was because he was talking to his girlfriend who also never does her homework because she always has something to do on the computer. @CAPS5 time spent with family, @CAPS5 exercise getting done, @CAPS5 time to play outside, and missing homework assignment are alot to sacrifice for ""@CAPS8 one more level."" I you want to help me get childeren not spend so much time on computer, write on artical on this important issue in one of your newspaper and please consider my ideas.",9
645,"@DATE1 @CAPS1 Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a huge affect on people. My thing about it is that the computer gets kids lazy and unactive. Having a computer will give kids the action to sit around and do nothing. I'm sure you've heard of websites such as myspace, facebook, formsping, etc. These websites can get a person to be willing to be on computer instead of exercising and staying healthy. I believe kids like me these day want to keep in touch with their friends. If the phone's not in the picture then the computer is. Also getting rid of the computer can stop the homosexuals from getting a hold of kids by acting their age. I will admit the computer can be useful but to be on all day that's just rediculous. I have a @NUM1 year old brother that stays on the computer from the time he gets til the time he goes to sleep. Compared to me he's not fit and healthy at all, that's what countless hours on the computer did to him. In fact he's on myspace so much that he has over @NUM2 friends and he doesn't even half of them he gives them his number and home address. Do you notice a lot of kids these days want to. can when you would rather waste the computer other than outside and at least self. I've always had a to football but I could @CAPS2 find the time to play with my brother. All they are about is chicks and of course the computer. I'm not asking to take away computer's in people's homes but put a stop to the daily number of hours spent on it because time is one thing that money can @CAPS2 buy. Some kids will look back to these days wondering how much time they wasted on nothing. long story short like life, dont spend it all on nothing.",8
646,"Dear State legistator, @CAPS1 you live back a long time ago when there were no computers. The only diffrence now is the technology is there but you are not allowed to use it. Do you think your job would be harder. I deffidently think that computers are making your job and everyone elses lifes easier. With the computer it teaches hand-eye cordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it gives people the ability to talk to each other. I belive the @CAPS4 technology of the computer is defidently helping out society. To start, computers are helping many people with their hand eye coordination. As you know hand eye coordination is necsicarry for a good driver. The @CAPS4 statistics that came out from “@CAPS2 drivers.com” the rate of accidents has decreased over the past ten years. In fact it decraced over @PERCENT1. With all the computer games that they have for young kids it is improving kids hand eye coordination. Starting at a young age. With the games like “@CAPS3” a majority of kids are ridding bikes skiing or snow boarding by five years old. All of these activities require very good hand eye coordination. Lastly , the resources that help with hand eye coordination are being used to help special-ed students get better at simple tasks at a faster pase. Secondly the world wide web is teaching people of all ages about places that are located thousands of miles away from their homes. Something that I personaly use my computer for is to research a location and find history on it before I go on vacation to that place. The computers in our school has helped our classes in social studies. My teacher @PERSON1 said that he has been grading more strictly often and the grades are still up by @PERCENT2 on computer and internet research projects. I should also add in that using the computers our school is in communication with a school in @LOCATION1. Once a week we email our pen-pa. the computers have deffidently helped my schools curriculum. Finally, computers are letting people of all ages talk to buisness partners, friends etc. The social networking sites have kept @PERCENT3 of friends in touch found in “@CAPS4-tech” magazine. I should also add in it has reconected @PERCENT4 of friends from high school all due to the computer. Another form of online talking is vidio chatting which many people are now using for buissness meetings instead of spending the money to fly to the location of their meeting. Now, for one day you should track how many hours you are on the computer for your job. I can bet the number is going to be about @PERCENT5 of the time you are in you office. The computers have with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about places far away from home, and lets people talk to each other online. So do me a favor state legislator relize and come to terms how much society needs the computer.",10
647,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I am going to inform you that more and more people are using computers then spending time with their family. I agree with the effects computer haves on people, because one it allows us to access information, two it allows us to interact with people. And three because it helps us updated on what is happening in sports or everything. My first reason why we should use computers is because it gives us information, like the weather reports, school openings, delays, and closings. It also tell's us how @LOCATION1 has been after the earthquake. It tells us alot of stuff. It allow's to go to other websites to find information to. And it allow's us to have fun and play games on the internet. It can help us on our homework. And it can help us find things like job and other stuff. My second reason why we should use computers is because we can ineract with people. We can talk to people weve never ever met before. We can find information about them and tell us how is their life litte. it can help police find info about their criminals and track them down so they can them. It is better and faster than using the phone to talk to them. And it can make people have fun which will make them stay on the computer for a long period of time. My third reason why we should use computers is because it would keep us updated on and for these who love to watch it would tell us the most recent on teams and players. And if you a sports fanatic you can be able to watch live games on the computer. And we can be able to post games and have a chance to see the players talk to their fans. In conclusion this why we should use computers because it can give us information all over the world, two it can allow us to interact with people weve never met before. And three it will keep us updated on sports we like to catch especially if your a sports fanatic.",8

This is a problem because @CAPS2 this ""no exercising"" thing does stop the life span could be greatly shorten. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 this doesn't stop more and more children will grow larger and not healthy.

The experts at @ORGANIZATION1 said ""@CAPS2 the children do not stop going on computers then they with never see the true beauty of the outdoors."" @CAPS3 you can see nature is some thing children need. Interacting with friends and family is important for everyone.

One year I found out the my great grandmother died of cancer. I had no idea that she had cancer. And I wish I was at the hospital with her. But wasn't because me and her never talked. Don't let that kind of thing happen to you talk and have fun with you friends and family. So @CAPS3 you can see that the use of computers is horrorable because you life can end sooner, your children get fat, and you drift apart from you friends and family. So don't let this happen to anyone else. Tell everyone.",8

Unaware at there surroundings, many people zone to their computer screens and only break @CAPS4 absolutely necessary. That is not what the world should become but that is what is society is creating. Computers do not create positive benefits to society. Because of all the time spent on the computer, people's bodies are taking the negative effects. There is also less and less face-to-face interactions with family and friends. Another huge issue is cyber bulling. These are all problems that should be addressed. With all the time spend on a computer in a stuffy, dark room, how will our bodies be maintained properly? Exercise is a key ingriedient to healthy living. It is like trying to make bread without flour, without that necessity the bread will not rise its full potential. It is the same with the health and functions at our bodies. Exercise must be took part in to burn fat and calories, but it is also needed to build and maintain muscles.

653,"Dear local newspaper from my point of view, computers are good to society and to the people because they help you communicate with people in other places or with your family or friends or meet with people from other country and you can become frinds. They are also good because they help to develop cordination on your hand with your eye, and they are helpful because you can buy things online. First of all I think that people who know how to use a computer can communicate with their family in other county or meet new people who then become friends with you and you can even meet them after you know them very well. You can even talk with your family through the computers and you won't spend that much money on expensive international phone calls. Secondly the computers are helpful because they help you cordinate your hand and your eye. This helps you because if you are a kid you have a big project; You will be able to finish it on time. From your point of view you can actually se were I'm going because after you finish the project you can go play with your friends and family on the patio or backyard. The hand cordination can help you develop mentally sight. Thirdly using computers is good because it helps you buy things online, the computer can help you buy thing like a clothes, shoes, cars, house and, many others, anything you need you can buy it online. In conclusion I think people should think about using computers more often either to buy things, to meet people or to cordinate body parts don't you agree with me?",8
654,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 @PERCENT1 in town use the computer for at least five hours each day. The people are spending way too much time and not benefiting. Computers have an effect on people but in a negative way. People get adicted and distracted and can't get work done. Many inappropriate things are written in computers that children and adults shouldn't read. Lastly people stare at a computer screen all day which can cause brain damage. Effects from computers can be very negative and not beneficial at all. With children at school and adults at jobs, there is most likely a lot of work to get done, but computers should make a person not get the work done. The other day in class the teacher was collecting homework, but @NUM1 out of the @NUM2 kids in our class didn't have the homework. When the teacher asked why the kids didn't do their homework, they said that they were on the computer and forgot about the homework. When the children and adults don't get their work done then grades could be dropped, or people could get fired. The effect is very harmful, and all this happened just because of the adiction and distraction of computers. Since some internet sources are very social, and not all people are kind, mean and inappropriate articles and language could be read. Many children don't know a lot of bad words and certainly no one wants them to be exposed to learning more, so why let them go on the computer and read about these bad things? Adults @MONTH1 know more about the harmful language, but why influence them to write the bad things or comment using mean tones. If adults and children aren't exposed to these bad uses of language then our world could easily be made up of better and kinder people. Studies show that if a person stares at a computer screen for at least three hours a day, then in about two weeks time the person brain could be damaged. The screen of the computer in some way with the human brain and if stared at for too long the screen could permenately damage the brain. A @ORGANIZATION1 student, who studies computer mechanics, quoted, ""@CAPS2 help prevent brain damage by limiting the use of computers to only what needs to be done. The mechanics to make the computer screen are not healthy for you!"" Who wants to have a damaged brain? Surely this effect could be very serious. So, in the end people should know that computers are not benefiticial. Computers effect people for sure, but not in a way that people would want to be effected. Adiction and distraction from the computer could cause important work to be ignored. Children and adults do not need to learn or be influenced by inappropriate language on the computer. Brain damage could be a serious problem that could be caused by something as simple as looking at a computer screen. @CAPS2 try to prevent all these negative effects by limiting the use of your computer. It is very easy to stay clear of any negative effects but it is your choice whether to do so or not.",9
655,"Dear Local @CAPS1, I think that computers have a posotive effect on people. There is many ways computers can have posotive effects on humans, first computers bring people together and let people interact with each other, They let people talk to each other. Computers also let people learn about new things. The internet has so much information. Computers also let people do things that they can't do with out computers. So computers have a positive effect on people. Computers let people interact with each other. The computers bring people together. People can use the internet to send emails to each other. When you need to write a letter to some one it might take days for them to got it. But with email they would get it the second you send it. There is also website like face book that let you talk to your friends websites like that connect people. When you and you freind cant talk together you just have to get on you computer. Computers also have web camera, those let people talk to echother. and you can see them. It lets people see the other persons facial expressions and hear the there voice which is better than on a phone and writing a letter to someone thats why computers are a positive effect on people Computers also let you learn about new things when ever you want to find somthing out or if you have a question you go to the internet. If you someone else they might not know the answer. Computer let people see pictures and videos. If you wanted to see a picture of @CAPS2 are that you are going into a computer and type it in computers let people see pictures that they couldn't see in real life. Vidios let you watch things like something funny to cheer up you day. If you love a show on to, and you missed it you can find it on computer. That is why computer benifit people positively. Computers also let you do things that you couldn't do without. When a teacher asks me to type a paper I always do it on the computer. If there were no computers I would have to use a typewriter and if I made a mistake I would have to type the whole thing again. Computers also alow you to play music. On the computer you can put a cd in and it will play the music. Computers alow you to do things that couldnt do without Computers benifit society an have a positive effect on people, They let people interact with each other and they bring people together. They let people talk to each other. Computers also let you learn about newthings. They also let you do things that you couldnt do without. Computers have many positive effects on people so I hope you agree that computers benifit soctity",8
656,"Computers can affect people in many ways. Most people use computers too much and it can affect their health and the peole around them. People need to get out side and get more active. America is becoming obese and not getting any real useful information out of the computer. Some people are just sitting, mind lessly infront of their computer and eating at the same time! That makes things worse as not only are they not getting exercise, but now they are gaining weight as well as not losing any. This is the exact opposite of what a human should be doing. True people exercise every day. Being on the computer is not a bad thing, sometimes. Sometimes you need to find something about nature but wouldn't it be easier to go outside and find new think I dont live by the but you can to one all the woods cannot be just gone. Even your front yard is full of nature, and you will be getting some (not all) exercise at the same time.

Dr. @PERSON1 or ""The studies of the human mind"" says ""I found out technology and online gaming increases anger in most people.""

658,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has been brought to my attention that some people feel that computers are bad for us. Some people say that they are a distraction to our physicaland mental health. Although I can see how some people would think this, I believe that computers are a good benifit to all society. I believe this because computers can help people learn, stay intach with friends or family that live faraway, and stay orginized. Sometimes people are on the computer, learning and they don't even know @CAPS1. Simply by visiting the @ORGANIZATION2 homepage, you automaticly see the news feeds of things happening around the world. Other times people go online diliberatly to learn. If someone is thinking about going to @LOCATION1 then they would probably go on the internet to learn about @CAPS1. Simply by searching equadore many choices will pop up you climate, sesonal weather, hotel options, and other farts. But thats not the only way people are learning on the internet. Now, many college students have the option of taking their lessons online. This is because some students like calm quietness or own house the distractions of sitting in class. Friends could be a big distraction in class, but how can you stay intouch with your friends if they moved away? I remember in second grade my bestfriend, @LOCATION2, move away. I was so sad. I badey ever talked to her, but then one day our parents set us up on a vidio chat! I felt like I was right their with her! This was great, and I though about how many people could use this to talk to relatives or friends. Another great way to stay intouch into friends and family is through e-mail. By writing a message and sending @CAPS1 can make staying in touch so easey, and your personal wants can chat and emails are a easey thing to send world wide. So many people love to type on a keyboard as well, but so many different papers that you type could be lost. I, for me, hate clutter, and I have so many school binders for papers to be lost in. This is why I take great advantage of typing my paper every chance I get. My computer keeps me orginiced because I could never loose my work. File save, is an idiot proof way to keep all your files in a safe place. Then all you have to do is press print to get a hard copy. I am sure that many people love using their computer for the same reason. Also, I myself am a much faster typer than I am writer so my work is a lot needey on the computer. As you can see their are plenty of reasons why using a computer is goof for our society you can learn, stay intouch with friends and family, and stay orginiced. Many people, could agree with me. Don't you?",12
659,"Computers, are very popular these days. Many people use computers for research, jobs, shopping, homework, and more.

What's great about computers is that, you can chat with your friends and family online or even have a video chat with them. So, you're never really avoiding your friends and family. Another thing that is great about computers is, you can research anything you need to, for projects, jobs, homework, and things for school, etc. The top websites people use for resources are, @CAPS1.com @LOCATION1. etc. Computers are also great for typing out reports , making powerpoints for jobs and projects, and so much more! Anything you could think of is most likely found in a computer. As, you can see a computer is so helpful and is a great resource. having a computer at home is much better than taking a trip down to the public library save time and money from taking all those trips and get your own personal library ny getting a computer. you never know what new technology could bring.",6

My first reason why computers are good is because people need to pay bills its easier to pay your bills online then to do all the paper work, and it makes it faster for people and computers are really good for them thats why we need computers. My second reason why we need computers is because people have facebook. And thats a good way to talk to friends, and get new friends and its fun to have facebook and just interact with people and why computers are good in society. My thrid reason why we should have computers in are society is because research and need to get info from and an computer is really good help for that, there great help for research like an specific topic the computer has all that.

661,"In todays day in age, computers are a key part to business, education, and recreation and they benefit our society. First of all, you can get a better education learning from them, also, it is a great way to communicate with people. Finally, it even teacher hand-eye coordination that you could use in your everyday life. My first point is that you can get a better education using them. For example, the textbooks that we use in social studies at our school still refers to @LOCATION3 as the @LOCATION1. Computers are a great way to get up-to-date information about the world. ""With our outdated textbooks in school, the @CAPS1 is our number one recourse to get information."" @CAPS2 @PERSON2 eighth grade teacher. With computers, you can learn about far away places without learing the comfort of your own home. In addition to getting a great education from them, computers are an eyelent form of communication. I remember when I was in @NUM1 grade and my father was across the world on a business trip. Our phones couldn't call long distance so we relied on computers to communicate with each other. This helped me get over my father's absence. When you use a computer to communicate you are also saving money."" You can save over @MONEY1 a year. When you use the @CAPS1 to communicate over a cell phone."" @CAPS2 @PERSON1, electronics expert. Finally, the use of a computer increas hand-eye coordination. With all the typing you do on a key board, your hand dexterity increases by the second. In fact, ""@PERCENT1 of computer users are more coordinated throught their day, opposed to people who don't own a computer."" @CAPS3 a recent pole in the @LOCATION2 times. And in this day in age hand-eye coordiantion is a neccesity. Besides wouldn't you like to have the ability to have your hands work without having to look at them? So as you can see, computers would benifit society and everyone who uses them. They are a great benifit that @CAPS4's need for their education and buisness. Thank you for listenging.",10
662,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that experts are saying people are spending to much time on computers didn't agree. Im writing to you today to tell you my opinion on the effects computers have on people with their time usage, what they are doing , and computer dead. If you will please continue on I would like to share with you my thoughts. Computers today are consuming our world. People are spending way to much time on the computer. I believe they should set a timer on how long they are on the computer. Lets say they set a @NUM1 hour limit then once its up they have to get off. I think this would help because if were spending to much time inside were not gonna be able to get enough exercise, which isn't good for our health. Please continue on to learn about how we should use the computer. Parents have to set a good example for kids. If parents use the computer @NUM2 then their child will think it's ok to do so. If the child then starts spending all their time on the computer then they won't be spending anytime with their friends. Kids today need to spend more time outside then playing games on the computer. Also the parents and child need to spend time together, if they are both on the computer they cant spend time together. Please read on about how we will go computer dead. Computer dead is a term I call when all we want to do is use the computer. We need to be healthy about our computer usage. If we aren't then we could start to get withdrawls from the computer and then will spend more time on the computer. If you go computer dead then it will slowly start to take over our lives. I think if this does happen it will be hard to get over an stop using the computer. Please read on to finish reading my letter. Thank for reading about how we need to mange our time issues, how we use the computer and computer dead. I hope you will consider my thoughts. Thank you again for your time spent reading this.",7
663,"In the world we live in now, everything is getting technilogical. In my own opinion, its a good thing. Using computers has been very helpful to our society. They give people the opportunity to research things fast and easily, they save trees, and they're a wonderful way to communicate with people. First, computers are great to use for research instead of books that waste tree. A few years ago, kids would get a school project on a certain country and the thing that would came to mind is the library. But, nowadays it's computers. Sure, of course books are very helpful, but so is the internet, plus its much faster and easier to find to find the information you're boking for. You can learn about a place before visiting it with a click of a button and learn about places far away. It really is magical. Next, using computers saves trees. With a computer we don't have to keep cutting down so many trees for books and paper. Another can now sell their books online and people are able to read them right. Honestly, there really is no reason to keep making books. Even students can do their home work, test and quizzes online! I think it's a mirical and it's so amazing to see how much our world has changed in only about @NUM1 years. Finally, computers are great to communicate with people far away. Some people have family in the war who they don't see for months or maybe years. With a computer you can get emails that get deliveres to the person right after being sent. Or you can even webcam and actually see the person face to face! It must be hard not being able to see your loved ones everyday, which is why a computer is very helpful. Even to those who have a family member away on a business trip or that live in another state/country. Computers are very helpful, especially today with everything going on in our world. With computers we can online research, save trees, and communicate with people far away. So, in my opinion computers do benefit society.",8

Using typing would save you this time and allow you to continue on with other important tasks that are needed to be completed. Furthermore, typing is a mandatory class for many freshmen and previous experience is very helpful to the teachers and students. ""@CAPS4've had many students,""says typing intruder @PERSON2, and the ones that excel not only get an 'A', but also cut there homework time in half.

666,"@ORGANIZATION1, In the @DATE1 computers have help man kinds. Computers are every where in a schools, homes band business across a @CAPS1. They help people in many ways depending on the what the person wants to set done. The ways that I use my computer is by staying in contact with my friends, a family, and it also helps me with my school work. I have been a live for @NUM1 @DATE1 and have already live in @NUM2 different states: @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and now @CAPS2 you would think I would have had lots of friends living in so many places. How do I stay in contact with them you @MONTH1 use? I use various and @CAPS3. If you get rid of computers I would not be able to stay in contact with tem anymore. Moving from place to place was very hard and sad thing to do for me. Another hard thing to do for me was moving away from my family, but thank to technology and computers I stay in contact with them. Imagine you haven't seen you family in @NUM3 @DATE1, well sadly thats my life so many birthday @CAPS4 all the family you can see is you parents. School another great example where society benefits from computers students and teachers use them everyday to learn. In my opoion learning is the greatest thing. One of my friends, @PERSON1, said this about the dell computers we use in the library @CAPS4 ever u don't get something about what we learned in @CAPS5 class that day. I use the computers to better understand it. Computers are a great way to research a topic, and thats why they should not be gotten rid of. I use computers every day for two reasons for school, researching or writing a project for any of my classes. Everyday I spend at least @NUM4 our writing something up for school. Computers help lessen the time spend writing it because it is fast and easy it is easy to type something, like a @CAPS6 paper on the ways to persuassive the readier. In the end computers are something we I need in are life because it makes life simpler. If I was to send a message to some of my friends in @LOCATION2 through @CAPS7 it would take seconds. Instead if I was to use the @ORGANIZATION2 it would take days. A life with out computers is a lot harder to do things, that we cant make simpler with computers""",8
667,"I think @CAPS1's should use computer's so they can help their self's by using a computer? First @CAPS1's should use computers because if they wanted to take notes on what their doing they can just go on the computer and write it. The Computers are faster than just writing. On a computer all you have to do is type. You can use a computer to look up what ever you want to look for example: the teacher ask to look up a giraffe. The only place you can find a giraffe is if you go on the computer and search a giraffe. That's a reason how to look up things it is easier to look up things instead of looking it up the most way. Lastely, if you have a project you have to and it involves pictures and you dont know how to find it all you just to do is go on the computer find what you searching for and then we are done after you found everything that you see @CAPS2 to let students use computers insde classroom/schools for the they can get easy help.",6
668,"I belive that computers benifit our society for many reasons. Computers have been around for many years now and everywere you go you usualy see one. That must meen people love then. These are so many uses and fun expeirences you can have with a computer. Computers make people happy and that makes for a better society because it is happier. they make people happy because you can play games like tetris, @CAPS1, and even cards. Compuer games make people happy because when ever they are bored and does nothing going on you can hop on the computer and play a game. Some of the awsome games featured on a computer are @CAPS1, cards, pinball and other great game. The computer makes for a happier home because as soon as kids get home from school they use it for games or chat with freinds. Another reason computers benifit society is because you can now pay bills and buy hings from the internet. When you pay bills or buy things over the internet have is no need to go out and waste money on gas so it makes people very happy when hey save money. It also saves on polution because if a car isn't going out there is less so computers are also saving society as well. My last reason that computers benifit society is they can make you smarter and make you do better in school by learning about often people or cultures. For example on my last research project for social studies I used the computer and got an A. this made me happy so in effect it makes society happy. Now you have my reasons why computers benifit the society. They make us happy, made us smarter, and make us a better society for it. I love computers and everybody else should too.",9
669,"In a study conducted by @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are spending more that @NUM3 hours a day on the computer. ""@CAPS1 computers became so popular here has been an increase in social problems, health issues and pollution,"" says @PERSON1. The question is then, do computers really benefit society or do they have a negative affect on people? I strongly believe that these computers are badly affecting us. First, less people are spending time outside enjoying nature. Imagine, sitting outside under the brilliant fall sun as leaves of red, yellow, and green dance with the wind. How will anyone see the beautiful sights of the outside world if their eyes are glued to the computer screen? Eight out of ten @CAPS2 surveyed by the national nature @CAPS3 admit to not going outside on sunny days but instead play on the computer. ""The more people who see how beautiful is the less likely they will pollute it with smoke. Dr @PERSON2. How is our country supposed to be clean if people want even turn off the computer the @NUM4 hour a day and see the world? In conclusion, computers have a negative affect on person because they seeing beauty. Second, computers take up so much time that people are with their families. I used to think that talking with someone. Now, I've realized that talking in real life with people is better. I remember meeting the girl. She woulod always talk with email texting of instant messaging. Seventy-nine percent of families split up due to social problems. All smart, intelligent people talks about families or just car and around, these sucessful people know the key to happiness is communication and are working to help get rid of computers. Lastly, more time on computers means less exercise. Teenagers are supposed to get one hour of exercise each day but @NUM5 out @NUM2 teens surveyed at @ORGANIZATION2 admit getting that exercise. There has been a @PERCENT1 increase in a obesity in children from @DATE1 when computers weren't big. Now almost @NUM4/2 of boys in @NUM8 grade at @ORGANIZATION2 agree to spending too much time on computers. In conclusion computers take away some important things line exercise. Come on now-can't we agree that computers have a negative offers ? our poor environment is getting killed because no one sees the beauty of families are seeing occupy their lives most a lot up and sight against computers today! It will be the best choice you ever make.",12
670,"Mom!!! Did you know that the human body has only one liver!!!, @CAPS1 I didn't where did you find out, on the computer. I recently heard that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, and enjoying nature. I dont think that they should be concerned because the computer leave's people with an open mind and teach people new thing. So the computer does a lot for people, give's them the chance to learn new thing, a chance to chat with friends far away, and also expand your mind of travel. Computers can do a lot for a person's life of know'lleage. Just yesterday I found out that the human body can not survive without its liver. The computer also helped me with my strugle's in math, even though that's what the teacher is for she is not always their, like when I am home or away on vacation and I just want to remember so thing's in math. Its also help's people who want to know new launage's such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4. So you see a computer has a big affect on a person's life. Two days ago I did a video chat with my grandparents back in @LOCATION2 it was great. After six year's not seeing my grandparents they really changed, and I was starting to forget what they looked like. I never knew that a computer could do a video chat from so far away I was surprised. I dont know why you experts are so concerned about computer taking away people's live's look what it has done for my family. I know that if one of you experts family member went away for a long time you would miss them and want to talk. Some people's love to video chat like people in the army because they get the chance to see their love one's. A two-way ticket to @LOCATION3, To see all those beautiful sight's and taste their wonderful food's look at that waterfall where is that, In @LOCATION4, @LOCATION1 now I have to go their. The computer has shone me places that I have neve sene before. The computer is a wonderful thing. So dont be concerned about us and what we do on the computer. In conclusion dont listen to the experts they dont know what their talking about, for all we know they use the computer more than we do. The compute can touch you new thing, give you the chance to chat with family and friends far away, and open your mind on travel. The computer is not a bad thing all it's doing is making life a little better step by step.",10
671,"According to @PERSON1, economic @CAPS1, every hour you spend on the computer, you raise your electricity bill by @MONEY2. The average @CAPS2 spends @NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. I believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing. You have economic loss from the electric bill, health loss because you won't be able to exercise as much, and community less because you won't spen as much with your community. Financial loss is something that many people are concerned about. If everybody spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, they could save @MONEY1 off their electric bill. In a survey, @NUM3 out @MONEY1 @NUM4 people said they would do anything to save money. So if they spent less time on the computer they would save lots @MONEY1 money. In addition to financial loss there is also a health issue. Many people are talking about how americans are becoming obise. Part @MONEY1 this is due to spending too much time on the computer. Proffesor @CAPS3 @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 says that, ""the obisety in @LOCATION1 is a problem, if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be solved."" @CAPS4, @NUM5 out @MONEY1 @NUM6 people are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, it would become @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM6. Although health is a problem community is a bigger one. People never talk to eachother face to face anymore. They all talk on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. Commmunities are spending less time together in real life than on the computer. @PERSON1, expert on human behavior, says that when people spend less time on the computer, ther spend more time together. It's a fact that when people spend more time together, they have more fun. So, I would say that spending less time on the computer would be beneficial to our community. It would provides financial, health, and community benefits. These are all important things that we lack if we spend too much time on the commputer.",9
672,"Dear @CAPS1 of Newspaper, @CAPS2 has been brought up to concern that computers are a mence to society. On the Computers are very helpfull. If one needed directions to a place or if one wanted to know how to do something @CAPS2 would show how to. They also can help you do things like read faster and hand eye corridnation. Computers are also a good form of entertianment. Those are some of the reasons computers are helpfull. First, computers can help find out how to do things. If there is evey somewhere far to go or there are many winding roads to get there you can use the computer. On the computer there are many maps that give detialed discriptions on how to get places. Specialist say that over @PERCENT1 veiwers get to their destianation. The due to lack of driving skills. Computers also help with instructions on how to make things. If there is a cake to be made the computer will have recipies to make @CAPS2. That also can help make projects. For example They show things about @CAPS3 mythology for making a @CAPS3 pat. The computer can help you, learn langues. There is software that can teach people languages just like books execpt that they have animated teachers to help speak the languege that one got directions to go to. Reading all the didn't langues can help you with normal reading. Another reason that computers are helpful is they can help people with reading. Did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 americans have trouble reading. That wouldn't happen if they had computers. Almost everything on the computer has to be read so @CAPS2 gives a lot of practices. @CAPS2 also will improve hand eye corodination. When someone something they watch the screen not their hand. Also on microcoft word to type an essay you watch the screen not your fingers typing. There are many games on the computer for improving hand eye corrdination. The last reason that computers affect people is that they are enteritaining. One the internet there are many fun games for all ages. Some games they could watch videos one youtube there are many funny videos there. As you can see computers are helpfull in many ways. They will give directionn to places or help people with reading, Computers are entertianing and fun.",9
673,"@CITY1 @CAPS1: I believe that computers (for now) are a good thing for our society. They allow you to see places. If you have a long distance relationship you can talk to them and they have many good excessories. What if you were looking for a new home? You could use google to search of selling homes in a certain location. Then finding some one to move your stuff for a fair price. Computers have many websites that you can go to when looking for that special place. The computer is also handy when you are going on vacation. You can look up the weather for that time. If you are going somewhere for, you can use the computer to find a plane. Computers are helpful when it comes to places! The excessories on the computer are endless. One big excessory that people like to do is games. Games are great to get your mind going. Practically all of the grades require hand-eye coordination. For example, @ORGANIZATION1. You need to remove all the tiles before the time runs out! If you are bored, games are very fun. I think that games are a great excessory. Some people have long distance relationships right? Well, if you have a computer you can have an online. This relieves many people when they know your not there. If you have an email, you can talk"" to your friends that you dont see at school. This gives you a chance to connect with them. Myspace and facebook are very similar. These are what you can use to talk to your friends at school. Computers are very useful. As you can see, I have stated many good reasons. Excessories, ""talking"" to people. Also, places. Many people use computers in their every day life. Computers are awsome!""",8
674,"Computers, a @LOCATION1 topic if you ask me. Sure they arnt very good for you dosn't mean if you use it correctly then it can be a souce of life. Computers are helpful in many ways, they can be an information post. The social networks can help your kids get more interactive with the world. During school kids have projects and without computers. Read on as I will explain in details. Computers, as you know, are one of the worlds greatest information posts. @NUM1 out of ten people survayed said that the computers are a value of everyday life, The earthquake in haiti is recovalng now, but half the world wouldnt know that with out computers so have a heart, and dont take away the most valued info in the world. Secondly, what would you say if I told, you that kids are more socialy retarded than ever! Well its true. Over @NUM2 of the worlds people rely on intractive websites to comunicate with each other. Fact, children have more friends over the internet then ever. You dont want to be the @LOCATION1 in all this do yours ar know as the person who kept kids from living? I dont think so. Lastly, all people in school use computers to do projects, for instance @PERSON2 had horrible hand writing and this was the bigest project of the year. So he turned his computer to type it, he gets on at. But what if there was (@CAPS1) computer! @PERSON2 would have gotten a @CAPS2 - for the project. In fact teachers @CAPS3 wear tell kids to type hw/projects. @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS3 year kids pass my class by typing and if they then they would all flunk!"" @CAPS4 got the point but more importantly do you?! To sumit all up for those of you lazy enough to not read there story essay. Computers are used for everyday needs such as finding out information. Makeing friends, or doing projects. So are you gonna be the person who sits back and lets that happen or are you going to get up and stop the maddness once and for all. Its you choice but think of the socity retarded, dumb kids that fail the grade @CAPS3 year.",8
675,"Do you ever have time to read? Do you ever spend time with your family? Or do you ever have time to go outside? Well, if you don't, it's because you spend to much time on the computer. Computers are bad for society. And I will show you why. There are many great activities you can do such as reading a book. Instead of reading on the computer, read a novel, you can ask your parents to drive you to the library. I understant that if you need to do research you can do it on the computer but in the library there are all sorts of books such as fiction, nonfiction, science books and many more. Every intelligent citizen would @CAPS1 that computer @MONTH1 have wrong information. I remember when I was doing a project on @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 music. I used the computer to research who killed her and it said that a man killed her. I went to the library and checked out a book on her and it said that a woman killed her actually. In addition books help you get more accurate facts. Every caring, loving human cares about spending time with their family. How can you spend more time with your family? Well, you can visit some cousins on the weekends. Your family can make parties. I recall having a party for my baby brother's baptism, everyone came. I got to see my aunts, and cousins that I didn't see in years. I understand that if you have a far away relative you would use the computer to chat with them or see them on webcam, but why not take a vacation were they live and go by car, that would bring the family even closer. I @CAPS1 what that is like. My family lives in @LOCATION2 and I visit them every year. We have family reunions, maybe your family can do that too. As a result, family is important, so don't let the computer ruin yours. Do you ever go outside anymore? Is the computer getting in your way? You have to check your e-mail, reply, go on your @CAPS4, its hungry, you have to do your daily activities. What about your health? Getting fresh air can be good. These are many great things you can do outside. For example, you can jump rope, go to the park, go swimming, play in the snow and many more. I remember the time my cousin came over and we went to the park. We stayed these until the park closed. It was very entertaining. Every citizen in @LOCATION1 wants to be healthy. Going outside can help you, run through the woods, or even jump roping is outside and excersizing. In addition just going outside can do more. Now is the time. Why wait another minute? You can either be all alone on the computer or be outside, or be with your family, even the library isn't lonely. Computers are a bad habit, even though we might need them, its better safe, then sorry to do it the old fashion way.",10

My opinion on this matter is that agree that computer are bad and people are spending. Too much time on computer. Also I agree with that because people are spending more time on computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friend, And thats my opinion on why people spending to much time on computers. Cearly you can that people spending too much time on computer and less time exercising. I say because i rember a time when my you to spend most of his time on computers and not for school eitner he would story on for all most the whole day he would bring food up stairys and throw the plates on floor just keep eating and eating and go to sleep without doing any thing. He would do this day after day. when I go over his house it would be dirty after all those times my my to hold him to clean up he didnt after he ate I ash edition want to got for a you can @PERSON1 the of and caliores he would say no I can walk on the computer, @CAPS3 one day he became really part and the doctor said you obeased but do you think he cared no but we would try to push him ever day to exercision know he has dibietes. We told and him told him spending to much time on computers is bad for you.

I rember a time when my friend would story in his house for day on a computer when I would ash him to come out sid he would say no all time, @CAPS3 one he to come out sid to get a new computer sofeware and when he opend door he got scared of the lite and run in side reason why spending to much time computers is bad for you this prove that get and play get active ",8

It is also faster than wating for them to anwer the phone and ther phone mite die. Or they wont answer and they need information fast. Another good thing about computers are looking up information like if you are going an atrip you can look up hotels find maps and plane tikets and see what the place will look like, or if you have a school project that you need to finish but you don't have time to read you go on the internet. If you have to look up a contry or a peresident or an animal or find picturs the internet has it all.

And second to help learn about black history month and famous people, we all know that black history month is in books but not lot of boosks have alot of info in them thats why the computer comes in handy because like on google it gives you more info and shows the image of that person so that you know who they aare, like a famous singer or raper you @MONTH1 like but knows nothing about them you would use the computer, @CAPS3 because thats the best thing to do.

680,"@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion computers can be entertaining and educational, but should not replace everyday living. Therefore I think that computers harm people and effect them in ways they do not realize. Three reasons that support my decision are the difference between reality and fantacy, family and friends, and your health. Many children and young adults are vulnerable to the assumtion that everything you see on the computer is true. Well, as some find out it is everything but that. The addictive games and electronic features lead you to believe that the people or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you see are real life situations and activities. Computers are showing kids the wrong mind frame they need to be in. It affects school work and how they behave. They need to be in the right state of mind and get back to reality. Your family and friends have always been there for you. By your side even through your worst. Unfourtunetly, this addiction to the computer has brought you farther away from them. They are not happy with the way you treat them. They want a change so you can enjoy life again. Interact with a human being, not some graphic designed computer picture. That's all it is anyway, and that picture isn't going to be there for you. Your family and friends last longer than that. Your body is special and your health is important. A computer @MONTH1 suggest exercise but you are not going to really do it. You know that and the people who make computer sites know that. Your going to stay there and burn your eyes out from looking at a screen all day. It is not healthy for you or anyone else. Moving you fingers and pushing buttons is not exercise. Your already sitting anyway, so you are not doing anything helpful to yourself. You need to go outside and breathe in air and be in nature. Run around or play a bill game, but not on the computer. In conclusion, you can see how a computer can effect a person. Not only do they mistake fantacy and reality as the same thing, but you lose interaction with your friends and loved ones. Your health is also at risk when you spend hours staring and not moving anything but maybe two fingers. Please consider the risks and believe the facts because honestly, we are losing the chance to live and enjoy the world.",9
681,"Dear NewsPaper @CAPS1, Have you ever taken into consideration how much an effect technology has on our society? Well, for numerous people, computers are their lives. They help adults stay in contact with their friends. Also, it gives users usefull information about anything you can think of. Computers are a great tool to help us with our lives, they help us learn skills for later in life. People who use computers do not spend too much time on them, we need them to live a good life. For example, the internet has many websites that keep people in touch. There are countless sites and to name a few, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, the list goes on and on. Many adults begin to realize that childhood friends seem to fade away as time goes on. With computers, you can chat with each other all night. In @CAPS4, it is also a convienient way to contact friends if they live in different places around the @LOCATION1. Moreover, computers are chock full of information. If a family wanted to take a vacation, they could use the computer to find a place they would enjoy and book a flight there. Also, if a student needed to do a report and was not able to go to the library, he/she would be able to use the computer to get the info for the report. Lastly if someone had an ailment and didn't know it was serious enough for a visit to the doctors office, they could look it up on the internet. they also have many sites for that sole purpose such as @ORGANIZATION2. Lastly, computer users learn valuable skills that these who don't will never have. Just knowing how to work one is an important skill but there are many features computers have that will help when a job or in college. For instance, making a power point for jobs or just slideshows of a party in your back yard. In @CAPS4 , typing is a valuable skill that most jobs nowadays require. And using the computer fine tunes hand-eye coordination. Although some @MONTH1 say that staring at a screen all day isn't healthy, @CAPS5 of @CAPS6.S.A citizens say using the computer is healthy for their social lives and we should use it in moderation. Computers are amazing tools if used properly and in moderation. The time has come to tell the people computers are usefull to society. They help social lives, teach us skills and, give us information on countless topics. People need them to have an enjoyable life. So, write an article regarding the need for the use of computers @DATE1 and notify the people they are making the right decision by using them. ",10
682,"Dear local Newspaper, This is a letter about how I feel about the effects of computers. I think computers are great you can, interact with family and friends, learn about things going on around the world, and it could help you with school work. First I would like to say that you can interact with family and friends. You can just go on facebook, @CAPS1, or,myspace and talk, send pics, and comment on other peoples things. There are many groups you can join too, wich allows you to talk to other people and meet new friends. You can also interact with your family if they have a facebook or @CAPS1. The second reason why computers are not bad is because that there are many websites that you can find different information like science, math, history and all that kind of stuff. There are alot of different topics you can learn. You can find information from the weather to where your family history comes from. My last reasoning for thinking this way is that many kids do their homework on computers and if people are saying that computers are bad than the parents are not going to allow them to use the computer for educational purposes like homework and projects. There are many other reason why computers have a positive effects of people. But interacting with family and friends, learning about things around the world and your education depends on computers.",8
683,"Dear computer experts, @CAPS1 this: A family of four is sitting in a small dark room, not talking, not laughing, just sitting lazily in their chairs, hunched over & bored. They aren’t communicating with any of their friends, and aren’t really doing anything at all. They sit there like lumps. This would happen @CAPS5 we banned computers! Computers defenetly have positive effect on people because they feed you a constant stream of knowlage, they develop good hand eye coordination, and they enable the people who use them to communicate with others. Clearly, they are a positive addition to our world. To begin, computers bring you constant a stream of knowlage. My close friend @PERSON1 told me recently that she is sometimes sitting at home, and doing her homework, and she needs to look up something. She simply grab her computer, and the information is delivered to her with the click of a button. @CAPS5 she didn’t have a computer sheld never obtain such knowlage. Second, in a survey of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of total computer usage is looking up information, and gaining knowlage. This statistic shows that computers defenetly help them when looking for information. Also a recent @ORGANIZATION3 article on computer usage states that @CAPS5 people didnt have computers, half of the world’s discoveries would not be around today. You can tell that the amount of knowlage that computers give us is very important! Next, using computers builds hand eye coordination as well. Children’s specialist @PERSON3 says, “@CAPS4 need to be able to play video games, even though they are usually discouraged on the computer. They build fantastic hand eye coordination, and help with many things including @ORGANIZATION1 & sports.” @CAPS5 there were no computers, this hand eye coordination could never developed! Also, at @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, they limited computer use, and as a result of it, the sports teams there all got losing records. Could this be because of the lack of hand eye coordination of those students? Additionally, at @ORGANIZATION1, after a recent survey, it was discovered that @NUM1 students who play video games on their computers do better in gym class because of the added hand eye coordination. Clearly computers greatly build hand eye coordination. Lastly, using computer allows people to communicate with each other through email & other social networks. After a poll from www.@CAPS6.com, we have discovered that millions of users use the computer & @CAPS6 to communicate everyday. We wouldn’t want to deny them of this, would we? Secondly, a friend of mine, @PERSON2, who goes to @ORGANIZATION4, says that the main way that she communicates with her friends & makes plans with them is by computer. @CAPS5 she didn’t have one, none of this could be done. Furthermore, a recent article by @PERSON4 a teen specialist at @ORGANIZATION5 says that when people don’t have computers & can’t communicate or talk to the outside world, they are more prone to diseases & sickness like depression or anorexia. When they don’t talk as much with their friends, these sicknesses are more prone to occur. This defenetly shows that communicating with computers is very important. Now, @CAPS1 this. The same family as before is sitting in bright, sunny room their computer screens flashing merrily. One of the boys calls out, “hey, look at his “ and the rest of his family rushes to his side. Their faces aglow with this @ORGANIZATION3 information. You can see that computers have a positive effect on people because they bring @ORGANIZATION3 information, they build hand eye coordination, and they allow you to communicate with others. So, computer specialists, what are you waiting for? Go to your computers right now & learn some @ORGANIZATION3 things!",12
684,"Dear The @ORGANIZATION1 @MONTH1 say that people are spending too much time foucusing on the computer and not on their homework, or getting some fresh air outside. I say those people are @CAPS1! Computers are a giant step into new technology. For example, you can use the computer to do research for school, communicate with friends online and give children some down time where they can learn about far away places and people. If you were doing a research paper for school and you have checked out all the books on the subject of your paper, but you suddenly relized that you forgot one of the most important books! You race back to the library only to find out that it is closed. Computers then come in handy. You can google the book and find an online copy of the book, so you make the grade on that paper. Also, possibly you are having trouble with math homework and you are home alone, what do you do then? That is what computers are there for! So you can easily go to your teachers website and there would be the explanation on how to do that specific lesson. Children @CAPS2 to commonicate with their friends, to some extent. Such as a homework question or just to talk for fun. Without friends children would be knowhere. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of all children who are permitted to talk with friends, out of school stay off of drugs and promote a stronger education and grades. The internet was not just created for the heck of it. It was invented so people can communicate, childeren can do reaserch, and for fun and exploring as well. For example - learning about far away places, people, and culture, exploring animals, and even online shopping is now availble. These are necessities for all people to have access to. Without computers @CAPS3 would not know the important news when @CAPS3 needed to or information needed for a specific moment. Computers are the future (yes I am repertative) @CAPS3 @CAPS2 to have computers in our lives for communication, shopping, learning purposes, teaching, research on places, animals, people, and culture. Also for email purposes and to get important news around to everyone applicable to it. This is why @CAPS3 @CAPS2 to continue forward with computers, and technology for the future. So all the people of @LOCATION1 keep your computers, they are an important stepping stone needed for growth and moving onto the future of technology. Plus who would not want a good computer game once and a while.",9
685,"Could you live a day without a computer? I talk to my friends everyday on the @CAPS1. I learn about current events that I wouldn't know without a computer. A computer also helps me through my daily life. I acknowledge that I should get outside and meet up with my friends, but sometimes when its raining or snowing I just want to talk to them online. Another great thing about talking online is that I can talk to all my friends, not just the one I am playing with. I noticed that even when my friends go away, they can still stay in touch because of their computers. Not only can you stay in touch with your friends, but you can learn about the current events. Whenever I go into @CAPS1 @CAPS2, my @ORGANIZATION1 page comes up and shows me the current events. Without a computer I woudn't be able to see who woll last nights ball game or whats happening with the health care bill. These are important things that help me keep up with things away from my town. A computer also lets me learn mopre about what the healthcare bill actually is and how it affects me. Not only does a computer teach me about current events, it also helps me in my daily life. When I'm eating breakfast, I check my email and look at the weather. During school I type up my essay. When I get home I check the homework and talk to my friends online. All of that is done on a computer. That just goes to show how much I use computers each day. i rely on my computer so much that I would be lost without it and I would get half as much done. I strongly beleive that computers are a necessity. They allow me to talk to my friends when we can't meet up. It keeps me up to date with currents. I think computers have become part of our daily life.",8
686,"Computers have caused many people money, friends and time. In fact, since that the computers came out this year, lots of people has been spending web to much time of them. Which can cause people to loose time and friends. Computers and technology today have had a very influence on very many people. Spending too much time on computers can cause to loose time and money. For example, my oldest brother was very large at the age of @NUM1 or @NUM2 because our computer started working, but this had a positive impact on him, he started participating in sports such as basketball and lacrosse and that he was very at them and followed lacrosse through highschool. While doing this he and saves my parents money. This is @CAPS1 reason how computers have had a negative effect on people. The new technology has caused people to loose lots of time when they could be doing other things that would them in life. For example, many people in the @LOCATION1 have half of their day to computers, and not getting the exercise of this are video games of the day on computers. This is @CAPS1 affect that computers can have on people is loosing or with friends. For example, I used to be friends a person, but then he did not talk to me for almost the entire @DATE1 because he was always on the computer, which made me think that he did not want to be friends but actually he just deleted almost all of the the @DATE1 to the computer. Since this helped I have been over to his house about @NUM3 times this year as to every @DATE2. This is @CAPS1 way computers can change your life. The time has come to decide whether to have a computer or not to have in computers. In my mind I that it would be best for everyone if we did not have the on computers, but if you do that we should have the an computers than put a certain time wait on computers. In your so you and your family members don't loose time, exercise time, or friends. Overall, I think that it would be best for everyone if we had a time on computers to the whole day on them.",10
687,"Dear Newspaper, i am writing you this letter, about computers, in the hope that you will publish it. Over @NUM1 the people in @LOCATION1 has a computer, but are they really healthy? I don't believe computers are a good thing. People spend to much time on them & less time excirsing, enjoying nature & most of all, it's highly dangerous. I don't believe computers are a good thing because people don't excersise like they did. Some people spend @NUM2 out of @NUM3 hours in a daw on computers for others it's there whole life. People spend so much time on computers they lose touch with the outside world. Ever since computers came out, obestity has gone up. all people do is chat to other people & think ""they don't have to know what I look like.""They sit at the computer eating & eating. That's not healthy. I dont think computers are good also because they spend less time enjoying nature. It used to be when I had somoe free time, I could call up a friend & ask them to take a walk with me somewhere & they'd say ""sure! Now they say ""@CAPS1 get on the computers & we can take a virtual walk."" That's not the same as an actual walk with the wind in your face the fresh smell, & all the animals, at least not to be. Nature is a thing of beauty & if you don't enjoy appreciate it, it'll turn into something hideous. Nature used to be the most peaceful think now it the internet. I dont think computers are good because most importantly they're dangerous. Little kids, like myself, think they're grown up & go on computers & meet rapist, murderer, thiefs, all kids of criminals. Also people send hurtful & violent things to each otehr & it yo're on the computer alot of bad people can track you down. Also, the military & @ORGANIZATION1 keeps secrets on computers but if your smart enough you can hack it. Computers aren't safe for anyone or anything. Well, I've told you my main @NUM4 reasons why I think computers aren't such great things, they're not healthy, emotionally or physically. People don't excirse they don't enjoy nature & computers are highly dangerous. All I can do is hope you publish my letter so everyone can see my point of view & make their own decisions. ",8
688,"Hello @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 you think computers are having a great effect on people? Well, I sure @CAPS3 think using a computer has a great effect on people. I say this because, people are probably waisting a full day on those facebook, myspace gol websites, looking up diffenitions for words, directions to places etc. If you think about it, this effect on people can ruin their eye-site, and social skills. These people are spending like @NUM1 hours tops on the computer. Staring at that @NUM2 inch little screen can damage your eye-site. This can lead you to getting glasses or possibly going blind. How would your life be without not talking to a girl/guy or even your own family? If you waist your time on those websites for example: facebook all you @CAPS3 is instant message the person. Maybe you should go out and @CAPS3 something fun with that person. What's this I hear about map it.com? Don't be lazy and waist @NUM3 minutes at your day just getting directions. Use a a real map! Also, free @LOCATION1? Come on! Use a real dictionary. So, I come to my conclusion by saying that these computers @CAPS3 have a ""great effect""on people. It gives them short cuts through life.",7
689,"Computers are one of the best advances in technology ever made. Not only are computers fun but they're also very beneficial to society. First off, comptuers are great way to communicate with other people whether it's instant-messageing, email, video-messaging, or services like @ORGANIZATION1. @DATE1, Computers offer many learning opportunities. There are thousands or websites with information about your search whether it be about simple things like how to bake cookies or even more complex searches like how many stars are in the sky. Last but not least, computers just simply make life easier by helping you with everday needs. To begin, computers are a great source of communication. I remember a time when my father traveled to @LOCATION1 on business. Because it costs so much money to pay for international cellphone service, my dad could not call using his cell phone. Instead, my father called using @ORGANIZATION1. It was great because it was right on the computer. Besides making live communication easier, computers also help to communicate news, weather few weeks ago, the the home was out. It was to shout the @DATE1, so my family had no way to. Since are than our cable provider, we were able to look up. School was indeed our computer, we world. Plus, computers offer more learning opportunities. Aside from being a great source of communication, computers are fantastic for searching and research. For almost all of my school assignments that required research, I've used a computer. Sometimes, you can even find articles from library books online. Some people say that the library is always the best place to find information but I disagree. More than half the time, the internet has beyond enough information for what I need. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that computers answered their question better than any library book, did. Also, computers make life a whole lot easier. Computers make life so much easier. From typing to research to communicating and even to making travel arangements, computers help to make everday chores a lot easier. When my cousing was in highschool, she was assigned a @NUM3 word essay for homework. First off, it's pain having to count everyword and also, most importantly it's no fun having to write that much so my cousin decide to just type it. It saves time and is way neater. She finish her typed essay in @NUM4 hour while love friend finished in an @NUM4 @NUM4/2 hours because she hand wrote it. Its you on computers are esier. To conclude, computers are beneficial because they're a great source of communication, they offer many learning opportunities, and they make life so much easier. Thank you for reading, and I hope I've persuaded you to agree with my position that computers are one of the best advances in technology ever accomplished and why they are so beneficial to society.",10
690,"Dear the newspaper, Computers are great resources and are helpful in many ways. @CAPS1 we have the technology, why not use it? Computers give us simple yet very useful programs like @ORGANIZATION1 word or photoshop, outstanding abilities to look up any information you want, and keep in touch with far away relatives useing facebook or video chats like skype. Wouldn't it @CAPS1 you were just about to finish an essay for school when you mispelled a word and had to start all over?! Well this is what happened frequently when computers weren't around and you had to use a typewritter. Unlike typewriter, computers have programs such as michrosoft word, where @CAPS1 you make a simple mistake, all you have to do is press backspace. With programs like this, essays and flyers are extremly easy to make. There are also a lot of other programs like powerpoint, photoshop, or video-editing. These are real time. You can just put your camera chip into your computer and ""walaa"" instant editting. Programs that you can download make life a whole lot simpler and saves you a lot of time. Along with the programs to write a paper, you can use the internet and google to get the information! All you have to do is type in a shourt phrase and instantly get thousands of sites, all packed with information. And instead of spending ten minutes in a dictionary. com and find it in a split second. I took a tally and @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 kids use the internet at least once a day! Lets say you had a party coming up, but had nothing creative to cook for food. Just type in creative foods for a party"" and you will easily have hundreds of newe recipies to choose from. The internet is an extraordinary invention that is very simple and helpful to use. Antoher fantastic thing to use on a computer is social connections such as myspace, facebooks, or skype. This is a great way to catch up with old friends from highschool or college, or plan a big event while being relaxed at home. @CAPS1 you had soccer practice at night so you couldn't hang out with friends, but still had time to do a quick chat, this is perfect. Skype and other video chats are amazing. They are very convienent when you need to speak with someone all the way in @LOCATION1 for busieness and don't want to travel. All you have to to is open a link a ""bamm"" they're right there! These are great for buisnesses and long distance ralationships. I have an uncle and aunt who live in and we use skype to keep in touch. It a fantastic way to communicate acros the globe. Computers @MONTH1 make as ""look""lazy, but give us a lot. Saved time from their convenence to run around and get exersize. Computers have amazing programs that help us in all ways, internet for quick information, and social connections to keep in touch with family, friends and buisnesses. Computers are one of the most convenent things we have and I strongly suggest you would agree with me.",10
691,"Dear whomever it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and I think that the effects that computers have on people is not good. I think this for a few different reasons. Those reasons are that because of them noboby goes out, people; especially students loose penmanship skills, and people loose their desire to do normal everyday things. They make us lazy!! Because of computers people don't go out. They don't go for walks because their doing something on the computer. There is now no reason for anybody to ever visit a store of any kind because you can order everything online and have it delivered right to your front door. Also, for a lot of people, they don't even have to go to work. They can work for whatever company right from their home computer. People can even finish highschool and college on their computers, by taking online courses! That brings me to @CAPS1 next reason for computers haveing a bad effect on people. Students, can now type out all assignments, some schools even give laptops to students to use throughout the year. Being able to type out everything would mean that students would barely ever have to pick up a pen or pencil, makeing their handwriting worse from lack of practice. Another way computers have a bad effect on students is because of the internet. You can find any and everything on the internet, from math books to dictionarys and other resource books. Because of this some students don't even know how to look up a word in the dictionary, let alone find needed information in a book. I think this gives students a wrong idea and sence of reality. When they go to work, not everything will be done on a computer, but this is all they are being taught to use. Lastly, people are losing their desire to do everyday things. Why go out with friends when you can talk to them online? Why go out to dinner when you can order it online? People are starting to see no point in going out and doing things because there are ""more important things"" to do on the computer. I personally think they are brain-washing us and pretty soon the world is going to be one giant computer. Based on everything I just said I don't think computers have a very good effect on effect on people. They are makeing the world a very uptight and controlled place to be and based on that selected information, I'm sure you can see why.",9
692,"@CAPS1 dinners ready okay mom, one second' click, click, click. Are you hearing this from your children than usual? Well if you are than you need to listen to this upcoming message. We the @ORGANIZATION1 believe are children and adults are spending too much time in their laptops or computers. They're not out exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with their family, these problems could lead to begger problems that @MONTH1 have already taken affect like: @CAPS2, financial problem and then to depression. So keep reading and think what you hear that could or has happened to you. @CAPS2 is a huge thing to worry about kids all over @LOCATION1 are on their computer than outside. Ever day I see my nephew on his computers I see him getting fatler and fatts every day. Studies have shown that children and adults that own as facebook or myspace account, they gaim about @NUM1 pounds every @NUM2 moths. If they're even on @NUM3 to @NUM2 hours a day they'll gain @NUM5 pounds every month. Sooner or later the state is going to have the @CAPS2 level from @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people who are obesy. This could lead to loss @ORGANIZATION1 jobs laziness. When people spend most @ORGANIZATION1 their time on facebook and myspace than they could lose their job's. More than @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION1 the state citizens own a facebook or myspace. So when people are addicted to them they're spend more time on that thatn the steff the have to do for their jobs. So then they'll get firm one can't pay bills, loans, and mortage. This then will all tead to depression. Depression is all over the state even the country. People are losing jobs left and right cause their computers and internets. People are even comiting climer like murded and even attemps @ORGANIZATION1 suicide cause @ORGANIZATION1 loss @ORGANIZATION1 jobs or family members. Some people are even so addicted to the internets and girths @ORGANIZATION1 new born family member. This depression needs to stop. So fight for the right to stop the addiction @ORGANIZATION1 internet use and live a great life. Drop the computer sead as book, meet up with friends and family, keep your jobs. Don't let these reson come between you and your life.""",9
693,"Do you have computer at home that you go on? Everyone goes on the computer for many different reasons with friends or for projects and @CAPS5 like that. Computers can be good in many ways but they can not be. Computers are made it do all @CAPS5 to help us learn. I personally think that computers are good. We can learn @CAPS5 that are going on from far away. An example is if we have a big project in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 about @LOCATION2, and we dont know the computer can look all different focus and see pictures. Computers can the history of place not us. I can sister talking how they had that has to be taken using a computer. The answer in the question world war @CAPS3. She got a @PERCENT1 we @MONTH1 also be able to see whats going on with the @LOCATION1 and different place. All you have to do for that is go on the compute and look it up. ""okay class today we will be going down in the computer to do some research."" said my teacher. ""what are we going ""@CAPS4."" @CAPS5 that are going on the @LOCATION1. All of these @CAPS5 can us research projects many other @CAPS5. We can also use computers. Computers also have different @CAPS5. An example at the program can help us that they let us look information, play game, help with our homework. I have just realized that you can pretty much do anything you want on a computer. @CAPS2 shows that @PERCENT2 of people in the @LOCATION1 go on the computer for help with their. I can remember my friend telling me that she always types her essays because its for her teacher and from typing. So the program is helpful to us. people always go on the computer and love @CAPS5 that are an save, at their. I usually do that so I know when a good is to an in the to buy what I want. Well you should really consider thinking about this those cant even reasons the people in the @LOCATION1.",10
694,"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Experts say that computers are ""taking over people"", I strongly disagree. People spend the amount of time they need and want then become active or spend time with family and friends. Computers allow people to learn, they allow people communicate to family and friends, too. Also, @CAPS5 people use computers for work and jobs. I believe computers allow people, like myself, to learn. You can learn also @CAPS5 things on the computer. You can learn about other countries, you can read articles on news, also. You can learn different languges and about the world. Online people can communicate with others. There is skype, which allows you to communicate with others while on the internet, you use a webcam. there is also instant messanger, or @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is like having a conversation with a person who's right next to you! Then there is email which can send letters, photos and comments. @CAPS5 people use computers for work. Microsoft @CAPS4 allows you to type stories and type letters. @CAPS5 people do job reports on @CAPS4. Also, the internet is helpful for work. Websites and search engines help you a lot. Websites can contain information that working people need. To finish this letter, I want to say that @NUM1) Computers allow people to learn. @NUM2) They allow people to communicate with friends and family. Lastly, @NUM3) @CAPS5 working people use the computer for work and reports. I hope I influenced you to see why computers aren't bad.",9
695,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 people think that computers are a waste of time and that they are dangerous. Yes computers can be dangerous but they can also help you in @CAPS1 diffrent ways. Such as paying bills on line or planin vacation and even attending collage classes. For @CAPS1 people bills are a strugle. They are an incovenienc and there are way to @CAPS1 of them. If you think about it @CAPS1 people work all day on some time all night, wouldn't it be nice to come home and have all your bills payed? Well one way you can do that is from a computers, computers have @CAPS1 programs that can help you pay your bills faster so that when you come home you can relax and enjy you free time. Computers are also good for planing vactions. @CAPS1 people each year use on line programs to plan there vacations and trips, for example my family and I planed a trip to @LOCATION1 in the @DATE1 of @NUM1. When we get to the airport we had first class tikets and a ride wateing when we got of the plain that @DATE1 was the best so far. Going into a new generation @CAPS1 people are starting to take on line colleg classes do to the fact that they work or have a kid at home these @CAPS2 are good for people with jobs because they are short and you learn alot. A computer is very helpful for taking these classes because if you did not have one it would incible you from taking the class. A computer is a great thing to have for all these things. So if your a mother of a worker and you would like to go back to school you should consider taking on line colleg classes. And if your family wants a vacation you should try out one of the @CAPS1 programs the enternet has for travling.",8
696,"Dear Newspaper, I have been reading about the debate about computers. People say that computers are teaching important skills. Others are saying that, ""People are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising."" @CAPS1, I think that people should be able to use computers (I mean they were ment to help us anyway) @CAPS2 think how much computers have helped the @CAPS3 race, from talking to friends/family in other countries too looking at what time the plane leaves to @LOCATION1. It is said that more one million people and up use there computer more than once a day. Without the compuuter there is no worldwide web witch is connected to everything in this world. Without computers you wouldn't be able to controll any robotic or wich will give more jobs but the cost of food to will go of tramendisly without computers the equipment wouldnt work in hospitals computers can save life they store important information we would have to go back into the dark ages with typewriters again. Another big issue is that people are over useing the computer. Once you learn to moderate the useige of your computer that wont be a problem. Some people say computers cost too much. There are ways to pot so called ""down payments"" on computers, something like a but you pay each month and setting up internet is easy as @NUM1. So, yes there are good and bad things talked about computers but without them we wouldn't have a modern era. Then controll the robot that makes your to the that saves lifes so with all this said I would lie to say thanks or listening and go computers!",9
697,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, With computers being so popular right now it's easy to think that they are helpful and have a positive effect on the people that use them. However, I do do belive that computers have more harmful effects than good ones on the people they are used by. I belive this for @NUM1 reasons. One, they take away from spending time with real people, they make people get less excersis, and also they are very distracting and waste time. One reason why I don't think computers have a positive effect on people is that the time spent on the computer could be put to better use by doing things with family and friends. Now and day people are using social networking sites like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 to talk with people far away. People can spend hours communication with someone they will never meet and completly ignore the people who care for and love them. Also communication with people online can be dangerous because the person who you are messaging might not be who they say they are. Overall, setting out and actually spending time with real people creates memories that you will cherish for the rest of your life. This feeling can never occur through the internet. Another reason why I think that computers have a bad effect on their users is that constant computer use has resulted in a lack of excersise for many people. People who use computers for many hours are just sitting still. They aren't being active. The only movement that occurs while on a computer is the tiny flick of a finger as it clicks the mouse button. This is clearly not enough excersise that is required to maintain a healthy and happy lifestyle. Studies have shown that since the invention of computers young people especially have been gretting less and less physical activity. I'm sure that this will continue to get worse if people continue spending a majority of time on their computers. A third reason why I think computers are having a negative effect on people is because they are distracting and they waste time. An example of this is that once when I was online doing research for a school project, I saw an advertisment for a website that looked interesting. When I clicked on it I was brought to a site full of funny stories and pictures. I spent the next half an hour reading entries on that website and completely forgot about my project. When I relized what I had done I rushed to finish my research and ended up getting a poorer grade then. I'm sure I would have gotten if I had not been distracted other things to do on the computer. This is why I think computers do not have a good effect on the people who use them. They take away from spending time with family and friends, they result in less excercise. And they waste time and are distractions. ",10
698,"Dear Newspaper, The invention of the computer has made a great impact on society today. Although many people would look upon computers on a negative note, the computer allows us to do essential task needed in everyday life. Many people feel that the applications on a computer are @CAPS1 keeps us away from doing other productive activities, but the applications a computer holds is neccessary for must tasks. Apps suchn as  the calculater saves time from doing all the work on a piece of paper. It allows you to do simple or complex math in just less than @NUM1 seconds. Its a great for finding how much a tip is, financial reasons such as now much you have to save, or even dung same basic math or science homework. Another great application is note taking that can easily be typed. This application allows you to take notes by typing, which again eliminates the need to write with a pencil or a paper. Note taking on the computer can be used for easy to read notes to study from to get a good grade on an upcoming test or quiz. The most important and must commonly used application on a computer device is the internet. The internet has over millions of websites for many reasons. If you plan to go to the movies tonight, the internet will surely give you movie times, directions, and how long the movie will be. It is also a great way to plan family trip or to book flights and such. Considering this, the apps are very useful. The computer is also a great device to use for learning. It allows you to look online about new subjects such as far away places or people @CAPS1 would our country be line if we were not educated on the outside world around us? It is also a great learning technique for research. Our teachers today gives us many projects and assignments to learn about new things, and @CAPS1 a great way to research our topic than on the computer. The fashion of the @NUM2 and @DATE1 is just a project I did last month. The computer allowed me to find the garment both women and men wore, @CAPS1 material they were made from, and even now they managed to buy and get the material. The research from my computer gave me a great understanding on my topic and helped me to learned the basics of my topic. You would probably agree that communication can be used in negative ways, but communication is @CAPS1 keep our world spinning. The computer device is one of the many devices used for communication. Email on a computer allows you to send messages to a single or multiple people whatout the need of signal or service. Blogging is also a way of communication on a computer and gives you freedom to express your feeling on education on a certain topic. The instant message is probably the must used by teens. It is quick. It allows you to quickly talk a person without waiting, for reply for more than days. In conclusion, the computer is essential to our everyday life and without the computer, our people would not function!",10
699,"Dear editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 is true that more and more people use computers, which in sure you're aware of, but is @CAPS3 really nessesary. I use my computer, I used to use @CAPS3 all the time, but then I got into sports like skateboarding and snow boarding so now i got away from @CAPS3. Yet, @CAPS4 are many many people that still use them and i believe that people should really try to stop going on as much because you could start to get big @PERSON1 fat, @CAPS4 are way better thing to do then sit around on the computer all day, and @CAPS3 is good to be outside getting some fresh air. First is that @CAPS3 is possible for you to get big @PERSON1 fat, being fat is not a good thing @CAPS3 could actually be heart breaking because they can't help @CAPS3, and i feel really bad for them. I have a few friends that are over weight like @PERSON1, @PERSON1 is a very over weight kid, he was about @NUM1 lbs whe nhe was @NUM2, I have not seen him in like a year and we had some good @CAPS2, but I do feel really bad because he is very over weight and @CAPS3 is terrible, @PERSON1 does not even know how to ride a bike, nobody would teach him anyways because he doesn't have a father and his mother is over weight as well and as fat as his sister. see her anymore. So being over weight is bad and sitting and playing on the computer will make @CAPS3 worse. Next is @CAPS4 are way better things to do than sit around on the computer all day, messing around on the computer all day is like saying in just going to throw my life away. Instead of being on the computer you could be with friends whether @CAPS3 is shopping sports youre still moving and that is way better then being on the computer trust me. Go for a walk @PERSON1 some thing just try to get yourself dumb, but still fun, computer. I will @CAPS3's fun @CAPS4 are many many thing to do on the computer. Most importantly is that @CAPS3 is good to be outside getting some fresh air, being outside is a definatly amazing thing to do, you could be walking, be on trampoline, @PERSON1 skateboarding anything is better then being on the computer, even just sitting @CAPS4 on a rock outside is good for your body cause you need to got fresh air in your system. Just do something that involves being outside @CAPS3 is so much fun. So all you computer lovers get off and have some fun being outside with friends @PERSON1 your family. I hope you all listen to me and take my advice so remember @CAPS3 is very possible to get fat, @CAPS4 are way better things to do then sit around on the computer all day, and @CAPS3 is good to be outside getting some fresh air.",10
700,"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 you know what computers are doing to the people of the @LOCATION1? Well I @CAPS2. People are on the @NUM1. We need to @CAPS2 something about these computers. They are preventing people from exercising, going outside, are are just making them stay in there house all day. One reason I think we should get rid of computers is because people aren't getting there exercise. the computer, next to the @LOCATION2, is probably the number one thing that makes people fat. Kids are sometimes on the computer all day eating snacks and junkfood when they should be eating healthy fruits and vegetables. You could. Almost @CAPS2 anything on the computer that you @CAPS2 in your everyday life, that's how good technology is. The computer is the thing that gets people addicted to something. The computer has games, internet, and ways to talk to people that get then attached. A second reason is that computers just keep taking money out of your pocket. When you buy a computer most people just buy the most expensive one, because the salesman talks then into it. Most people don't know what kind of computer they are supposed to buy, so they buy the most expensive one because they think the more, the better. Also just buying the computer isn't all of it. When you download softwares, games, and moble things that all cost money. Downloading one thing can cost up to one hundred dollors. plus, most people can't afford these downloads after buying themselves a pricy computer. My third opinion is that the computer is just a complete waist of time. People spand hours on the computer doing stupid stuff, like playing games and talking to the, when they should all be outside enjoying the fresh air. Going outside is very important to your health. Next time your on the computer doing something that doesn't need to be done, go outside. Think about it, hour often @CAPS2 you go outside? My guess, not much. Now @CAPS2 you know what computers are doing to the people of the @LOCATION1? They are making people fat, not getting there exercise, eating junk food and play games all day long on this stupid piece of technology. Instead of being on the computer all day why don't you think about going air you need. Also you don't want to be waisting all of your hardworked money on a stupid piece of technology. Plus, you don't want to deal with softwares and there viruses. My advice, computers are terrible.",8
701,"Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I would wont computors because it benifits our society. It helps on learn about countries around the world and whats going on. For example if you wanted to no about it's sports, you can just type in name. Also a computer can help you with your education. If you were working on a homework assingment and you needed some help you can just go on the computor. It is also very benifial because student can have lots of fun playing games on the comput say like it's a cold rainy day and there is nothing to do, a kid can get some entertainment by going on the computer. It is also a good way to communicate with you friends. For example, facebook, @CAPS3, twitter, and email one all good sources of communication. Also it is good for if you have a xbox or a @NUM1 you need a computer you need to hook up a card to your computer so you can play online with your friend. It's good to have computors in school. Is teachers want some students to go on a website to learn something it is a very helpful source. It is also a good in source because in school if your working on this big project a computer can help you do it. I hope these one all good reason to have computer in our society, and it will benifit us in a number a differnt ways",7
702,"Dear Newspaper, People use computers in their everyday lifes, & having computers has become customary to many people throughout the @LOCATION1. We go on computers for research, writing papers, or just for pure entertainment, in all these ways computers are very helpful. But, like all good things, too much computer time can be harmful. Sure they provide our lives with knowledge, info on the outside world, & connections with people from just about anywhere, but some of us become too attached with this virtual life instead of living our own real lifes. This happens to many people, some don't even notice what computers are doing to them. For most people, life @MONTH1 be challenging & the real world to stressing, so they retire to the computer for awhile, & to me this is fine, but when someone were to keep doing this it would become an addiction. Instead of relaxing by taking a walk or reading a book, they go to the computer, this would not be good for their social life or their minds. In my opinion, minds need to think, they need excerise by puzzling over something or figuring out a problem. Sure you think your brain is thinking by playing a challenging computer game, & sure, in some ways, it is. But it could reach its full potential by doing something else thats not straining your eyes so much. Computers can be good, but not for everything in your life. Now what about your social life Computers can be a helpful resource in many ways, but not if you let them become a destruction. This @MONTH1 happen by letting the computer be your constant companion. Now a days people have come up with online games where you can interact with other people. This isn't neccessarily bad unless your whole social life is only with these online people that you really don't know, instead of with real people that you see at school or meet on the everyday streets so what I'm saying is that a talking with people online isn't bad as long as you put them as secondary friends & have real people come first. Like I said in the beginning computers are part of our everyday life, and its not a bad thing, they can be very helpful. But you must control what you do on them and how much you use them. If you do that you will most likely have a much more balanced lifestyle. Making you, your friends, & family a whole lot happier.",10
703,"Dear local Newspaper, I am writing this to let you know that many people are spending to much time on computors rather than enjoying nature. People say advances in technology believe that computers have an effect on people in such a way of saying. Many people showed on as is say can use the computers but to remember to think about nature what nice things it has in store for us. Im going to saying that experts are right that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Im thinking that in some points many family members and friends see then other relative person on companion so much on the computers it's like if they are thinking maybe they don't care anymore. Caring about nature and your loved ones is such a great thing. @PERCENT1 of my friends agree with me when I say that people should be less on electronic devices because that can effect your brain or maybe your eye sight (eye vision.) @CAPS1 more and more people should lay off it. @PERSON1 of yale university has conducted extensive reaserch and proven that many computers that are being used by people can be damage of using it every time. I strongly agree with him that there should be a time limit on something to let them later on have the spaare time to enjoy and have fun with nature but something different such as to enjoy listening to soft music. I know you will agree with me when I say that maybe people should spend less time effecting themselves. Whatsoever im hoping from you to agree with my position so this can be possible to break this habit of going on computers and having no time for your family and friends is not such a to start off with.",8
704,"Dear @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 the world having a network where people can connect, learn and work efficently. This wonderful network is here in our computers. Computers benefit society because they help @CAPS3 connect with far-away places, develop hand-eye coordination and get work done faster. In the days before computers we were isolated in our immediate area. @CAPS2 being stuck in our town unaware of the rest of the world, unable to enjoy the beauty of @LOCATION3 or send help to the starving people in @LOCATION2. @PERCENT1 of money donated to @ORGANIZATION1 an organization that assists in global disasters comes from online. Without the computer how would our willing people help the rest of the world, or even know about the rest of the world? Give our community the ability to reach out to the farthest parts of the globe, give them computers. Computers produce games and activities more intense than you can find anywhere else. Playing baseball simply doesn't require enough focus. The computer's intricate experience helps future engineers or even pilots develop a focus and hand-eye coordination that could save lives. @PERSON1, who trains the @CAPS3 air force weighs in on the effects of computers. ""They have made a great deal of positive impact."" he states. ""@CAPS4 soldiers have excellent eyes for controls and amazing reflexes, making them natural pilots."" @CAPS5't our community have the opportunity to excel as well?

Don't stunt our community's workers, give them what they need computers! Computers are too important and beneficial to lose. Our community benefits from the computers that help @CAPS3 connect with far away places, give @CAPS3 hand-eye coordination and help @CAPS3 work quickly and correctly.

705,"Dear, editor @CAPS1 you know, @PERCENT1 of children who spend most of their time on the computer that do not exercize can develop weight problems and blood disorders? That is just one way that advances in computer technology have affected people so far. If advances continue that number will increase and other problems @MONTH1 arise from it. Some other problems that we have @DATE1 that could get worse are, developing a weak immune system, and emotionally seperating yourself from your family. First, lets talk about obesity. Obesity is a terrible sight to see someone go through because of something as silly as being, basically, addicted to the computer. Not only can obesity constrict vital organs but it can lead to blood disorders. Blood disorders, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, can cause you to have a heart attack. Which cuts off oxygen to vital areas of the body. Which leads to, eventually, promote death. Dealing with obesity is bad enough, but seeing them suffer because they have developed a weak immune system is horrable. In my experience I find that people who are on the computer often generally don't have very good immune systems. For example, a friend of mine is on the computer quite often, and has developed a weak immune system. Because of it he misses at least @NUM1 day of school a week. And because he misses so many days a school year he usually keep bad grades. Which is yet another reason why advances in computer technology are a bad idea. So isn't it relatively obvious that advances in technology are a bad idea? Especially being that, children are steadily becoming obese, and developing a weak immune system can affect your life in ways that are totally controllable? So I urge you to write an article about this to stop the growing sickness known as health problems due to technology.",8
706,"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever been running late to a party and just realize you don't have the directions to the person's house? Have you ever had to write a paper and there wen't any books or encyclopedias available? Or have you ever just wanted to catch up with an old friend? @CAPS1 you answered yes to at least one of these questions, there is a good chance you have used a computer in your lifetime. Computers have positive effects because they can give you quick and reliable @CAPS2 and the can be fun too. To begin with let's go back to that example in the paragraph above. Have you ever been running late to a party and realize you do not have the direction's to the person's house? @CAPS1 you have, there are two things you can do in that situation. You can call up the person who probably wan't answer because they're @CAPS4 fun at their party, or you can go on the computer, type the person's address in and you will have your directions in seconds. Call me crazy, but this way seems quicker more efficient and reliable.

And it's just one click away, @CAPS4 sold that, the computer has positive effects on you because it gives you quick and reliable @CAPS2 In addition, computers have positive effects on you when you're trying to have fun.

In conclusion, whether you're bored at home and it's a rainy day, or @CAPS1 you have to nght a research paper you saved until the last minute, a computer will be there for you. Positive effects computers have - are that they are quick and reliable, and they are fun to use.",9
707,"Dear @CAPS1, I think computers have a positive effect on people because it will help you with interacting, learning and coordination. By interacting with people like far away friends or unknown frieds. If they are far its a nice way to send photos back and forth to see how the person/people are doing. Family is a very important factor in computers because if you havent seen the person you can tell how they are progressing in life. If thats not the case you can meet new people. By meeting new people you have more connections in your life and more people to trust. Learning! Learning is a good thing for adults an children. Computers can teach children by showing them new words, colors shapes and sizes. For an adult it can show them meanings of words or new words. Words, colors and sizes can all be round on a computer all by learning. A computer can not only do mental things to affect you also physical like coordination. You can improve your coordination by making you stronger when you type. Your hands are a big thing in like and they are helpful in a lot of ways. By sitting up straight in your computer chair all day can improve your posture. Your back can get straigher from all time you are sitting. Your mind can be foucused and in one pot fucusing on thing is good for you such as the computer screen. Now, people can think that computers are good for you too.

709,"Dear local newspaper did you know that the average person spends @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes a day on the computer? This is why I think that people are spending ton much time on computers. If people spent less time on computers they would exersice more, be outdoors more and spend more time with their family and freind. If people were to spend less time out computers than they would exersize more. With the growingproblem of obesity in @ORGANIZATION2 less time on computers would help this. Tests show that the less time spent on computers the more time spent exersizing. And with @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 obese this world help that problem alot. I once had a freind who would allways be outside exersie and playing. Then he got a @CAPS1 acount and he started to be home on the computer all day and would never be exersizing. Less time on computers would also time outdoors. Result from a I took at my school say tahat @PERCENT2 people would go outside if they couldn't use their computer. And it more people are outside will notice how nature is and @PERSON1 says that use of the electricity in a house. So if everyone of it have a effect on if to turn off their computers they would spent more time with friend and family. that there are to freinds and family on programs like @CAPS2, @CAPS1 and it is talking face to. And you could also do like to the and you see people. use @ORGANIZATION1 but you would need and it. I would be alot easyer and less it you would get of the computer and talk to them face to face. This is why I think that people are spending to much time on their computer and it is having a effect on their life. If they were off the computer they would spend more time exersizing, more time helping the environment and more time socializing with their family and friends. So please @LOCATION1 stop using the computer all the time.",8
710,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1, I am on the computer alot. But I think it is one of the most addicting, time consuming inventions in todays society. Yes, computers have benefits such as talking to friends and family you don't see that often, doing school work, and gathering information. But in my oponion I the people should reduce their usage of computers. Sure, computers let you interact with friends in family via e-mail, or @CAPS2 messaging, or social networking websites such as @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. Guess what? You can easily communicate the old fashioned way with cell phones, or even writing a letter. See? There are alternitives for communication. Exercise is so important now a days, and people do not get enough of it. Did you know that obesity, has gone up @PERCENT1 since last year? Thats a fairly big percentage, and we don't want it to get any bigger. If people are wasting away, staring at their computer screen and not getting any sort or exercise in, the number will get bigger. Also, computers can cause all kinds of medical problems. For example, about a month ago my back was really bothering me. I went to the doctors and he told me one of the likley causes was leaning foward togo on my laptop. ""Computers can also cause vision problems and haedaches."" says specialist @CAPS5. Oz. We can prevent these issues if we take a stand against computers! We can limit our use to two or three times a week, and only use it for important reasons. I hope this really is an eye-opener to the negative effects computers have on us.",8
711,"Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1; Technology seems to have a positive effect on people. But could it be a bad thing. The computer is one of the top uses by @CAPS2, but I think we spend a little to much time on it. My reasons are, kids and adults spend to much time on it, cant interact with friends or family and you cant enjoy nature. Dont get me wrong, its nice to meet new people on the internet and learn about other places. But when are you going to get your exercis of your on it for @NUM1 hours? Sometimes you can never get up because your eyes are stuck to the screen. As for food, you sit and eat junk food. You cant get a healthy meal if you eat chips & candy for hours. Instead up being blinded by the screen, you can get blinded from the sun outside by riding a bike. Its a great way to get fit, rather than typing and clicking away at your @CAPS3. Another way of getting fit, (than to sit) is going out for a run. Kids need about @NUM2 mins of cardio, so why not run your legs than your newest download? You work out your arms & your legs! My next reason why spending time on the computer too much is bad is because you wont have time for your friends or family. Are kids just going to sit at the computer all day while your family is having fun? Also, when you have chores to do, what will happen to them? The dishies will be dirty and your room will be a mess. Most of all wont you miss your friends? At this age kids/teens should be partying with friends and not gossiping online. No one would ever want to invite you anywhere because they will know you will be on the computer. Lastly, my final reason is the most simplest; enjoy nature explore the outside instead of living on the inside. Its good to go out once in a while and get a breathe of fresh air. If you havent visted the park in a while it would be great. Hear all the birds chirping and see the trees and flowers bloom! Then take a nice walk or stroll in the park. Your getting exercise & exploring nature too. While your at it, plant some flowers in your garden. This shows instead of buying games online, your buying seeds to help the environment. In conclusion, spending time on the computer is not bad, just dont spend hours-upon-hours on it. Kids will be kids, as well, adults will be adults. So take the considerations in hand. So try to get exercise, hang out with your friends & family, and enjoy nature!",9

713,"Dear editor, I have heard that some experts are saying that @CAPS1 spend too much time online. I thoroughly believe they are mistaken. With the use of internet people can learn about faraway places without spending money to go there. Our military uses internet to talk to their family and friends stateside. Also it helps us aquire great hand-eye coordination. If someone was planning a trip to @LOCATION1 they would check the internet often. Firstly, they would check out sites to go to in @LOCATION1. Second, they would check and compare hotels in @LOCATION1. Thirdly, they would check the weather in @LOCATION1. Finally, they would check airports for flights going to and from @LOCATION1. Without the internet planning vacations would be close to impossible. People not only use the internet for pleasure but for communication purphases too. They use web cams to talk online to people in faraway places. It is fast, free, and convinent way to communicate to other people. Our military uses web cams to let the soliders talk to their families. How would you feel if you were a solider fighting for you country and the means to talk to your family is out there, but you could not use it. It is cruel and unjust to keep soliders from talking to their families. Internet also gives us something usefull. It helps us build hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is used in many things. In basketball you need to be able to look up and dribble at the same time. When you are driving you need to be able to look up and still be able to steer the car. Without hand-eye coordination many more accidents would happen from carliess errors. Internet helps people make the world a safer place. In some aspects the experts are right. We should go out and enjoy nature, but we also need to enjoy and use the internet as well. Some people use it as pleasure and build hand-eye coordination. Whle others use it to talk to their loved ones. Or use it to plan vacations. No matter who you are or what you do internet plays an important part in life.",9

For example, @CAPS1 helps you with essays and reports.

Many schools have a computer lab for students to complete their @ORGANIZATION1 tasks. @ORGANIZATION1 has also aquired convenient-sized laptops to help students do their projects and take test. That saves a lot of paper and a lot of trees! Furthermore, many colleges offer their courses online. You can obtain a college degree right at your house without going anywhere. Education has never been so easy, thanks to our advanced network and computers. It is very important to mention the entertainment benefits of computers. I have notices many teens play cool games on the net. They seem to greatly enjoy this opportunity. It in an ideal way to relax after a stressful way getting on the computer and listening to the newest songs. Some websites after downloadable songs for free so you don't need to worry about the financial part. Moreover you can watch movies online anytime, form wide section such as horror, romance, comedy, fantasy or even children films. No more movie tickets, no more driving in the theater. Without a doubt computers can put a single on everyone's face with its entertainment benefits. Many people feel that computers both kids and adults always from their social life, but actually, computers give them a chance to communicate with other people around the world. Ten @DATE1 @DATE1, who would have thought that they could chat and talk directly with same one a thousand miles @DATE1, with no mail or telephone or whats over? I came to the @LOCATION1 @DATE1. I am extremely grateful to computers because I can keep in touch with my friends and relatives. I can just send them pictures of the snowy winter sceneries here through just a minute. How much easier could it get? computers definitely improve communication and brings people closer. Let's not wait any longer. Computers have endless positive effects and should be popularizeas.

Say your bestfriend moved to @LOCATION4. You won't see her but you can talk to her on the computer. Now in day there are a lot of websites that you can chat off at or you can also do a webcam chat like ovoo. For example, in seventh grade I moved from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2. I was so upset about leaving my old friends. Turns out I was fine. I just made more friends when I moved. I would make plans with my friends over facebook chating. Consequently, computers help a lot you keep in touch with friends all over the world. Computers build up your skills for everything. Hand-eye coordination is the biggest skill that computers teach anyone. When your watching an adult type most of them can type without looking at the keyboard. This is an example of hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is very helpful in sports. In basketball you should dribble and look ahead. Kinda like typing. As one can see computers help with hand-eye coordination. Google gives you answers to anything. If you have research to do most people use google and google is found on the computer. You can learn about @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION4 you name it you can type it in google, and you can learn everything about that country. For example, last year everyone had to pick a state and learn certain things about it. Most people used computers. Computers really are the best electronic in the world. There are many electronics that effect people. But, computers effect people the most. Computers let you talk to family and friends around the world. Also, computer teach you hand-eye coordination skills. Lastly, computer teach you about many countrys. In conclusion, computers should be advanced.",9
716,"I agree with the computers helping people. To start with, computers have a possitive affect on us. They also give us the ability to learn. Also it allows people to talk online from far away places. So, yes, computers are good for people. First of all, computers do have a possitive affect. The computer @MONTH1 give some one motivation. Or it will help someone find their lost pet. Also it could help you get a job. Plus you can find a safe home with it. So, ya computers do have a possitive effect. You can also gain the ability to learn. This is by helping deth people with sites on sighn language. Also you can get information on places you will visit. This will help learn about diffrent contrays. Most importantly it will help kids an adults on school work or work. This concluds that you can learn things on the computers. The computer also allows you to talk with people far away. This will come in handy for familys. Also people who have hospitilized family. Plus fathers or moms in the military can talk with their kids. Most of all though is adopted kids could talk to their birth parents online. Here is another reason why computers are good. This is why I agree with computers. They have a possitive affect on people. They given us ability to learn! Lastly it allows you to talk to people you love that are far away. So, in conclution, it is a benifit for people to use the computers!",8
717,"@ORGANIZATION1, The use of computer per family has increased greatly in the past @NUM1 years. In that same time people are getting fatter and they need more exercise. If you use the computer it might break or not work properly. Computers are a big waste in time and a bigger waste in money. In the past @NUM1 years many people @MONTH1 have gained a lot of weight. They do not do regular activities like going to the supermarket because you can shop online. Studies show that if you go to the supermarket or a store you are likely to be less fat then if you shop on line. Another reason why computers dont give you exerise is because of google. If you wanted to see a picture of a beautiful mountain you could just go to google and type it in. It is a much easier way to see sights but if you walk you could burn up to @NUM3 times as much calories then if you just look it up on google. Another reason why computers dont give you exercise is you can get addicted to a game. Lets say that you have basketball practice at @NUM1:00pm. If you go on the computer at @NUM5 then you could easily get addicted to a game and forget you have practice. You would be stuck on your computer mindlessly typeing a way on a computer game that doesnt help you anywere in life. When you dont go to practice you will not sweat and therefore gain extra weight. Scients say that if you actully play a sport you can lose weight by up to @PERCENT1 then if you didnt. Before there computers life was simpole, no student forgot there homework. But now they use there computer many things can go wrong. First the printer can break. @CAPS1 year my printer stoped working @NUM1 times so I could not do my homework. My teacher said that forgetting my homework affectde my grade by over @PERCENT2. Another reason why handwriting is more convienet is you are capable of doing writing during school @CAPS1 year with my teacher @PERSON1 i had to write a prompt. She told me to go to the computer lab and type it but all the computers were taken. When I got down stairs she told me I had to write it so I got a @NUM7 because she could not read what I wrote. Every other kid got a @NUM8 or above but since I was not use to writing it affected my grade. Another reason why computers are inconvienet is when you need to do research. My parent got rid of our books a wile ago because of computers. So one day when I was home alone I had to reasearch euthonzing dogs on the computer but there was a power outage. I could not do my @ORGANIZATION1 events for science so I got a @NUM9 on it. That grade brought my adverage down form an a+ to an a-. The only reason why I got a bad grade because I depended on the computer for reasearch and it let me down. If I had better hand writing I would have gotten a better grade. The final reason why computers do not benifit society is because they are a waste of money. Most computers caust up to @MONEY1 for the computer and installing. There is no need for them because everything computers have a library can give. The library has books so you can reasearch with books insted of computers. In my house all @NUM7 people in my family has a computer but @NUM11 of the computers are used once a week. They are extreamly expensive and there is no need for them. Also my dad works at a computer store and he says that the computer people are overcharging by @PERCENT3. With that extra @MONEY2 you could buy many books and magisnes insted of a computer. That is why computers are not useful. People are not getting exercise, so the gain @PERCENT1 more weight. It is much less convienent then writing by hand. Finally they are a major waste of money. The decads without computers were much more useful and everyone lived happpier.",10
718,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing this letter on behalf of all the busy people in our country. We have come to the conclusion that we need, not want, but need computers in our life. First, we need them to communicate to other people. Second, we need computers to do research for school and work. Lastly, us kids need computers to type essays, prompts, or papers for each class. Communication is very important in everyday life. For instance, I have a grandma that lives in @LOCATION1. I only get to see her once or twice a year in person. Throughout the entire year, I video chat with her through @CAPS3 computer because it is a whole lot easier than flying there. Without computers to video chat with @CAPS3 grandma, I have no communication with her they one or two times a year. Using a computer for communication is extremly helpful it allows you to do so many things without travelling for, like video chatting. Another reason why computers are a neccessity in our is because reseach for and easier. Many kids nowadays have so much homework and spend on the internet. For I myself, that I. The internet is a quick way to get the reseach. Plus, the research I have found is just as accurate as a book from a library. Computers are absolutly needed when kids have a load of homework and projects that need to be researched. Thinks when the time a to, kids have to type up essays and prompts that its unimaginable. Just in the @DATE1 I had to type on english, essay and a fluently paragraph. Final grade @CAPS2 I did not type it, on a computer. Typing things on the computer cames out of school also, whole @CAPS3 dad is frequently typing up and he is also typing up essays for his company. Many things nowadays in order to be perfect, have to be written up on the computer or you will not get the result you were hoping for. In conclusion, computers are modern devices and you are going to have to live with it. Computers provide great communication with everyone around or even across the country. Also, they make research for school become a lot more efficent. Finally, computers type papers and essays up faster. Computers are a neccessity for living.",8
719,"Dear local newspaper, did you know that just about @PERCENT1 of the people in the @LOCATION1 have computers and use them daily. I am one of those people and I don't get how people ar saying that computers are destroying our country, yeah I know that we spend a little less time with family and friends but computers help as help monitor weather and natrual disasters like torndos and hurricans, they give us a chance to see far away places and learn more about the world and we can talk with other people. Computers are way important in our world because we can monitor natrual @CAPS1 such as tornados, hurricancs, and earthquakes without this technology over @PERCENT2 more people will die from these @CAPS1 without computers because the will less or no warning about the situation. Over @PERCENT3 of kids in the @CAPS2.S go to school and with computers the kids get a better chance to learn absent the world and society. Kids should know what is going on in the world, or you could be a adult just browsing the web loking for information. My point is tons of people all around the world computers to learn. My last reason is to teach kids to type and to have hand eye cordination when kids get older and when we get @CAPS3 they are gonna need to learn how to type. So odds are if you don't know how to type you won't get very far but there in the real world. To conclude my statement im gonna go over my three reasons why we need computers first to track natrual disasters. Second to leern about far away places, and our society. Third to teach childeren hand eye cordination and to to type so they can get @CAPS3. This is why the @CAPS2.S realy needs computers.",9
720,"Computers definitely have a positive impact on society. They help organize your thoughts, which stress. So, they contain many inspirational articles which can convince kids to strive for surless. Lastly, when all else fails, the computer can be a great way to relax and clear your mind. Computers help organize your thoughts, which helps reduce stress. Imagine you working on a project in school. Everybody can add to it, and you can selectively choose which additions you want. In addition, you @MONTH1 also block the programs that you don't want. This device is called the computer, and it's changed @LOCATION1's society for the better. On average, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS1 suffer from stress. Now if you organize your thoughts on the computer, and are able to look through them again at why a huge alleviated. Instead of worrying thoughts you @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not remember, you now have confidence that you can look back and find your thoughts right on your @CAPS2. Reduced stress trading to confidence effect on society. Also, the computer contains articles that @MONTH1 insure our children to strive for their goals. Once child read an article @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1 book. As an @NUM3 using @PERSON1 as well in school. By games, I observe how into @CAPS3 since I started seeing @PERSON1 as role model to me, high making a stride for a @CAPS4.O @CAPS5. Where did this inspiration come from? Researching @PERSON1 on the internet. The internet, in this instance, obviously had a positive impact on @CAPS6 society. Lastly, when all else fails, you can rely on the computer to make stressful situations seem less overwhelming. If you have the ability to solve a problem, then why can't you solve it? Often times, the answer to this question is that the situation is too overwhelming. If you take a break go on you @MONTH1 relax simple games put out a variety of websites. Now say you came back and attack the problem again. You continually chip away at it, and it seems overwhelming. Thank you computer gods! The computer, in this instance, has made - positive impact an @CAPS6 society. So as you can tell, computers make a strong, positive impact on @CAPS6 society.",9
721,"Dear local newspaper, I just wanted to say that I do I agree with you that some people spend a lot of time on the computer. My reasons are that people need to exersize, go out doors. And have fun. If you keep reading you'll understand why they need to do theis things. My first reason was exersizeing. And the reason why I say exersizeing is because you don't need to be on the computer all day long. So many things that they can do, is run, jog, and go for bike rides. I mean it's ok to go on the computer once and a while to learn but that's why they have books, and school to learn about things. My second reason was going out-side and the reason for that is because people need to get fresh air and not be locked inside all day. Another one was to explore and go on a hike to see what is out there and just have a good time. My other reason was nature. And what I mean by that is you can go to the zoo and learn about stuff there to. Another thing is that you can do much more with out being on the computer all day long. My last reason was you can talk to your friend about stuff, you can go to the mall all day, you can also hang out with your friend and have a sleep over and watch movies. You don't need to stay on the computer all day you need to have fun. This is why I say you don't need to be on the computer. You can do other stuff and still learn with-out being on the computer. For once maby insed of talking online you can actultly go to your friends house and talk. Thank you for your time. Hope to talk to you soon.",8
722,"Dear @CAPS1, I agree with the experts that people spend to much time on the computer, people should be exercising, reading, or spending time with friends and family. But people are so lazy and would rather be sitting and doing something on the computer and if they dont start doing other things instead of being online they could become overweight. My first reason why people should spend less time online is because people need to exercize. Seriously people should be taking walks around the block or going to the gym or even playing a sport instead of playing on the computer all day and doing nothing and without exercising you will become overweight and lazy. My second reason why I think people should spend less time online is because you should be spending time with your friends and family not ignoring them because your doing something on the computer. Thats just rude, so why dont you go and have a family game night or go out to eat with your family and you could also watch a movie, go skating, or even go to the park with your friends because thats a lot more fun than being online all day. My last reason why people should spend less time online is because everyone should have time to just read a good book honestly just walk down to your local library and check out a book because reading is way better for your brain than doing stupid stuff on the computer. So in conclusion, in my opinion I think people should spend less time online is because if you dont get enough exercize you can become over weight and lazy, and not spending a lot of time with your friends and family is just rude and reading is very good for you unlike staying on the computer, well that is all I have to say for now.",8
723,"Everyone loves staying on the computer. I would be surprised if one does not. I believe the whole issue is that the machine itself distracts you from other things in your life that is also as enjoyable on it is. People learn too much on it. It changes peoples whole life. The computer is like a disease or a virus that controles you and gaining your freedom from it perfectly possible. I understand that some people @MONTH1 not agree with me, however I propose that my side is the best. This is horrible. How can it? It distracts people from their life. I makes them blind to enjoy nature. Spending too much time on the computer is a horrible disease. The hard part is to get in your freedom is being able to know that it is ocntroling you. That way your door to freedom will be open. The tecknologie keeps you away from having fun, doing homework from school and having fun with friends. I know that you can break free from it because I once experienced the same thing. Technology is a beautiful thing indeed. I has so many information in it you wont even think a person it. I know even more than . However it is also very foul. Once I came up on a very horrible seen on the computer. I my i can shut it . Michines have a mind that it our and anything it. Changing a persons life is not easy. You become complitely new. Sometimes those changes are good sometimes they are bad. But a michine can make you change in ten minutes. Once you see what you like on it or what you want you can change. If you see something and you want it so bad. I you cant get if then you will be forced to get it by stealing. It is a very horrible thing to learn. All you have to do is learn to controle your self. Machines are a very bad influence on people. There are book if you need information. Computers make you lazy you don't have to read or anything it does it for you. It take over your life. You become . It teaches you bad thing it changes your life. What path would you take",8
724,"Personally I think computers have a good influence on people. There one of the greatest inventions.With computers you can listen to music or watch @CAPS1, research things for your projects, or just have a good time. Computers help people create, listen to, watch and make music and @CAPS1. When you have a computer you can get influenced by other musicians to create music. And where does eating that music need to go? Into a computer to add beats and different vocals. You can also watch @CAPS1 on there! Not exactly @CAPS1 but whatever show you'd like to see. Some people even create movies on special programs. Thats not all though. Alot of questions can be answered on the computer by doing research. Cures for different disease like cancer can be found. Even small research projects like ""Who founded @CAPS2"" can easily be found with one quick google search. Yeah we might be getting lazy but it makes peoples lives simpler. For instance intead of reading through dozens of books you could just search it on the internet for the answers. You can even take classes online not impressed? Another great effect of people on computers is socializing and having fun. Socializing over computers @MONTH1 not be as effective as socializing in person but it gives the quieter people. like me , a chance to say whats on their mind. Plus there wont be any of those akward silence moments like there usually seems to be on the phone. Oh, did I mention facebook. On how I love facebook. I get to keep in touch with my family and friends I no longer see. I used to have a very close friends, but after we switched schools I never heard from her. Until I found her on facebook. Same with many other people. And for the younger ones they'll be bored with the billions of games online. How could you go wrong? Sounds to me like computers have a positive effect on people. But what do you guys think. Can one big negative out weigh a ton of positve? I think not.",8
725,"The advancements of technology has developed so much that it has become comenly known to us as a normal house hold such as we use it every day at work, home, schools, bussneses it has become a comen used item in the everyday life. Emails, researching, questions on the world around us. It is required at almost every job application and at school and every thing in between. It's the - @DATE1 - complete age. Computers are and every day thing such as email how thats something that I dont worry about that and also there used to file a tax return. Also it is used to make reports up for people. Computers have also become a comen used thing such as school that we use them for reports, studies, and some home work. Also buiseness use it to comunicate with corprat @LOCATION1 uses a wide stance of technoligy they rec got a whole bunch of apples. Last.

And this is why computers are needed in this society to use every day and thier comenly used and that are requirded.",8
726,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers are both a good and a bad thing. Computers allow use to play games, and learn about almost anything. But computers cannot simulate fresh air and exercise. Computers allow people to play a wide variety of games. People can play chess, solatire, and a great deal other games like that. Computers also allow us to play a very wide variaty of online games. I can think of at least three different sites that have online games. Each site having at least @NUM1 different games! Hundreds of thousands of people play online games everyday! What would they do if we didn't have the computer to play those games? We can also search any topic from a computer anywhere. This is a amazing thing to be able to do. Imagine if nobody had a computer how would we research so much of our knowledge? Yes there are but using a computer is so much more faster. Plus you can print thing out on a computer with a book you have to copy important down. But you can highlight the important. How much could ? No matter how much computer do they @MONTH1 be but it is kids getting bigger and bigger all because they long. Computers are amazing and society benefits from them by a lot. But just like everything computers have their downside. So please inform adults and kids about the goodness of computers, but also warn them about the bad things that could happen if you spend to much time on the computer and outside.",9
727,"Dear local Newspaper, I have heard that there is a controversy over if computers benefit our society. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they have beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. If we were in a world without computers then our society would be completely lost. First off, one contributing factor is that computers help us keep in contact. Any one person can simply send an email by a click of a button. However, if this device was not around, we would have to use postal service or the telephone, both of which cost money. Why wouldn't you want a computer? What happens if a hurricane is abroad, and a family has no idea of its presence? All they need to do is check their email or the internet to realize what danger they are in. Calling somebody is risky because they could not be able to ansuer for any reason. In a situation like this, computers became essential to everyone. Clearly, the ability to contact is a great reason why computers need to be kept. Secondly, computers help us complete our daily work. Almost everyone works during the week, and if you @MONTH1 not realize it, we get most of our help from computers. Let's say that a man or women is ath theiroffice and they need to create a power point in order to share the companies new brand. All he/she needs to do is turn on their computer and begin to work with a blink of an eye. But without this device, what would they be able to do? How would they complete their work? The need for a @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or laptop is obviously great when you work. Lastly, computers give us the ability to play games and browse the internet freely. When I go home, usually I go straight to my computer like most teenagers do. I can easily check scores or last nights games, listen to music, and play solitaire by myself. I dont need to turn on the @CAPS3 and wait throve . All of these tiresome commercials. I don't need to grab a @CAPS4 and throw it into a boombox. I don't need to grab all the playing carols and set a game up. All I need is my computer. Without a doubl the fun and helpful computers such as games help us out. Although some say that computers aren't needed they help us throughout our lives. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they are beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. All of these facts to one final solution, which is keeping computers in our society.",11
728,"Dear local newspaper, This world is filled with electronics. These days the computer is the latest hit. But even though it's popular, is it really the best item to have? Many children and even adults are hooked onto the computer. It is taking away their life. Four out of five people each year are losing interest in going outside to play. That's not how you should spend your life. We all want our children to be active and healthy, not be a couch potato. Each day, more kids are getting addicted to the computer. Now, every time a parent needs to punish or ""ground"" their child, they take away the electronics. What ever happened to grounding them from going to hang out with their friends or just playing outside? Another horrifying conclusion that the computer does to us is rip apart us from our loved ones. Kids are more worried about ""@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" or even trying to slay a dragon than spending time with their family. They would pick the computer over someone who has been in their life forever. This computer is splittling families apart. Now, more families only spend time with each other when they eat dinner together. Also, rather than talking to their parents about a problem, kids are going to websites like ""@CAPS3"" or ""@CAPS4.com"". More people don't enjoy doing some things now because of the computer. Not many like going out and enjoying nature. Some don't like reading anymore because they rather play games. Some people don't even want to pick up the phone and call for a pizza. Also people who look for jobs don't go to the newspaper anymore; they go to the internet! The world is revolving around electronics. We need to end this before our kids or grandchildren start getting out of shape and start relying on the comuter for everything. Do we really wan't to destroy this world and lose bonding with our families? I say, make life better and get rid of computers!",9
729,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects that computers have on people is that more and more obese people. People tend to get moody. and it seems that computers are addictive. I think computers have a huge effect on people. The nubmer one thing is that more people every year are becoming obese because they do not leave the chair they sit inside for most of the day. Also they get so lazy they don't want to get up so they will just order food and have it delivered right to their hause. The next idea is that they do not get enought exersise, because they isn't sit there all day and don't move. But when they do move its to get something to eat or go get their phone. This is why they should limit kids and adults to only @NUM1 hours or less of computer time each day. @CAPS1 next reason is because people that are on computers tend to get . Like one second they are happy and once they get off the computer they are sad. They get all couped up inside for the whole day. They don't see enough because people don't see they . If they hour each day the moody ness would change. People need lot of exersise to maintain weight and muscle. @CAPS1 last receson the computers have effects on people is that people will tend to act addicted to the computer . Like if they are playing a game all day and don't realize it they will get addicted and not stop playing all day. People need to leave the computer and do something else like ride a bike or play a sport. In conclusion what I am trying to tell you taht it is not good that people stay inside all day and play on the computer, because it is hazardous to your health and it is putting you at a hgih risk of obesity. So can you please listen to @CAPS1 ideas.",8
730,"Dear local Newspaper I believe that computers are a great help to society I will explain my thoughts and ideas to you. I hope you agree with me after reading this. For starters, I would like to say that my first subject is communication, computers allow us to talk to everyday folks or folks that are around the world! There are many ways to talk, text, speech, and webcam, and it is not like you cannot talk to them there are hundreds of communication cients, servers online @NUM1 usually, so you will always be able to someone! Secondly, I would like to say computers have a great way of creation. On a computer you can program @CAPS3, design presentations, documents, drawings, maps, graphs, almost anything you put you mind to can be virtually made. You can gather information from servers websites, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 you can create and learn a lot on your everyday computer. I am not fisned! There are @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, reading, book sites all on the web! This gives the opprotunity of the ""web searcher"" to have a vast ammount of information! and allow he or she to learn alot more in every day life. Finaly, I would like to say that computers has a wide range of entertennent! There are many to choose from like videos, movies, @CAPS18, @CAPS1, games anything that is suitable for the user or users of the computer. On a game a user @MONTH1 talk to friends, while @CAPS14 a game such as a (@CAPS8 @CAPS9) for example @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 online, @CAPS13 @CAPS14 game. These kinds of games skyrocket entertennent lovers for the vast ammount of enjoyment they can endure while @CAPS14 a @CAPS8 @CAPS9. Another type of entertennent is videos people can watch videos and movies on a video and more website which has a database of not thousands but millions of videos and movies. Whatever the user wants is a text and a click away! The last type of entertennent is @CAPS1 and @CAPS18, these allow the user to daily life or take to friends, family or relatives. To sum this all up I would like to tell you Local news paper that you should agree that computers are a good thing for the society! Please reread and pick the right @CAPS2!",8
731,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think computers have a positive effect on people. Where would we be without them? Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about any subject they want, and allow people to communicate with each other, no matter how far away. Obviously, computers are beneficial. I think computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, as I said earlier. I know people say that where you are on be computer, you spend less time exercising, but the computers help you with you throwing skills. Hand ey coordination also applies for if you want to be a surgeon/doctor. You need to have steady hands. What we ready to do whatever is needed. See, they do have a positive effect. I think computers have a positive effect on people. They give people the ability to learn about anything they want on the internet. Say you want to be an engineer when you grow up, you might want to learn anything and everything you can to be successful later on in that carer. What about a doctor, you would want to know how many years of college and med school are required to get your medical degree. A computer helps you learn about those things. It can also teach you about tons of other things. Again, how could they not be positive. I think computers have a positive effect on people. Another thing they can do out of a hundred others is let you communicate with other people no matter how far away. Mail can so my where with enough, yes, but @CAPS3-mail is free and gets there in less than a minutes where mail can lake weeks to go far. For example, what if you came from another country. You wouldn't want to lose touch with people you grew-up with. With a computer, you could use skype to see now new the person. Talking on the phone or mailing doesn't even compare to that. You could never lose touch! Computers help people do all kinds of things. I conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about any subject they want, and allow people to communicate with each other, no matter how far away. There are no bad reason that could top any of these. They make sense. So, what do you think? Do you think they are good for us, or do we need less computers?",9
732,"Dear newspaper, I know that computers can place a person in its spell, but in reality it's one of the most necesary things we need in our lifetime. Computers are used for many things like school work, planning that trip you always wanted to go to, and reading the latest news. Read the following to know just how important computers really are. You know now when you have that project due for science class about protoplasms. You want to do as you can so you have that at. When you realize that the one book you find on it wont help you with the score you want you realize that the nextplace to look is the computer. The computer gives you an unlimited amount of information that will help you in any report. When a teacher gives you a book to do a biography on, for example, ""The life and times: @PERSON1"" You want to go beyond what they give you and search, for instances, his neighborhood, his inspiration, and the influences he had. You will find all this in the computer. When you see a sale on a ""five nights and four days"" trip to @ORGANIZATION1, you want to know what better sale they have. When you start to notice that your family needs a vacation what is the only place to look. You can'@CAPS3 look for that trip of a lifetime in a book. Sure you can find out that @CAPS1 is having that big blowout sale, but you cant search up the best deal. I've done a research with seven of my friends and that six of those seven parents have deal on a trip to @ORGANIZATION1 on their accounts. If you're a great fan of road trips you'll find a deal or @CAPS2's for the lowest only find out by computer. If you live in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4 and you want to have a trip to the @LOCATION1 this deal is really good. If you live in the @LOCATION2 and you know the hottest day in the @DATE1 is coming you will be ready to get those beach balls and that blanket ready, but if you think computers are a waste of time then you wont know that all the beaches open and will be sending free drinks all day. You will be at home eating a @CAPS3.V. watching old reruns of The @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Not only will it tell you news in your erea, but will tell you about that devastating earthquake in @LOCATION5. You'll also be informed about what people are doing to help them and what you can do to help. So not only is the computer good for going on @CAPS6 and @CAPS7, you can help get your grade to an A+ on that history report. It also works well for giving your children a memory they will always remember. They also help you to get ready and not be stock in your house on that nice day in @DATE1. Maybe if you find that great deal or help your kid get a better grade then you will realize how good the computer is.",10
733,"Dear @LOCATION1, I know having computers has a positive effect on people. The computers connect families, contain information which is great for peoples education, and are very conveint. Computors are a step into the future and we should take advantage of it. First off the internet or e-mail will help family members connect. My family, which lives @NUM1 hours away by car, love to talk with me by e-mail. This helps me connect with my family and is just another reason why we should have computors. Another reason that includes family is when the family is just sitting around and are calling everywhere just to find a board game, it would just be easier to go online to find it. This way it would be quick and easy to find that one board game. The last reason why a computer would help a family is if a family wants to get in to any kinds of activities and they need the number they could just go online. On the internet the family could find the numbers, the and some information about it. This way more and more families can do activities together. As one can see the computer is bringing more and more families together. An other reason why the computers are good for society is educations. With information at the tip of your fingers more and more people will want to learn. Now a days people try to find the out, but will all the tools on the computers mae people get the education. Secondly computers are another way to go to collage. If you arn't up to going to school/collage because your sick. You wouldn't have to miss anything because with a click of a button you will have the materials needed for what was missed. Lastly everyone knows that in @LOCATION2 most classrooms can't afford one computer. The children want computors so hard. If they were to get one it would change so much. They would be able to learn so much more than before. The children could lean about different countries far away. As a result computers would improve the way we learn. The last reason why computers are so helpful is convience. Now a say the world is crazy, so if we don't have to go out or talk to someone we won't. The computer will offer the ability to confrence will other people so that there would be communication between work parttners. With the ability to talk with another for work would make us a lighter nation. This is only one of the many reasons computers are very conviente, subssiquently computers are conviente because you could book flights, vacations, rentals, and much more. With a click of a button you should be going to @CAPS1 or a nice vacation.",8
734,"Dear @CAPS1, I beleive that using computers is a good thing. They can help you learn about subjects of places you think are interesting you don't know about. They can help save the environment. These are the reasons why I think using computers is a good thing. First, they can help you learn about new subjects. Say you are doing a report for school on the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 of the @CAPS2, but you didn't know any thing about them. You could just go sit at your computer, enter ""@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 of the @CAPS2"" in a google search, and press enter. There you here hundreds even thousands of entries about the @ORGANIZATION1. You could sit forever and learn all about these magnificent creations. You can learn about any subject on a computer, at anytime. You could even learn about a computer and all of its history! Seond, they can help save the environment. People are always using paper and paper comes from trees. When we cut down trees we are harming our environment. We are depleeting our oxygen supply and destroying habitats of animals and insects. If everybody used computers, we would be using less paper. We could use to send documents and papers, we could bring to tax appointments and pair suits. Computers could even be used for school work. The teacher could asign the homework email it to the student the student could fill it out and email it back. Sure we would still have to use paper for somethings, but we would be using in way less. People could also use less fossil. We could talk via the internet and things like skype to communicate witness waring to and burn. Thirdly, computers could help us advance into the. Computers can help find ways to do many things such as better medical treatments, more efficient travel and even every day life. We could find better ways to treat serious medical conditions with the help of computers. We could find ways to treat cancers and maybe even the common cold. Computers could also hep us find more efficient way. They could help find a mroe efficient feel, efficient of it could help make a teleportation device. It could also help us explore deeper into space and find more planets and galaxies. Computers could also help us with our every day life. When you get up in the @TIME1, imagein being able to screen and being able to have a hot shower, your breakfast and your work equipment all ready within five minutes. That really would be the future of computers. Those are all of any reasons for having computers from school reasearch to space and beyond.",10
735,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am aware that some people think computers have a negative affect on others, but I think it's the opposite. Computers have completely changed the world. People can save work on them, visually experience things they've never seen before, or even catch up with old buddies. In my opinion computers have a positive affect on people. With computers you can create documents, pictures, and even movies that will stay on your computer forever. How about your newspaper company? Does somebody hand write every paper that comes out? Without computers hundreds of copies of your newspaper wouldn't be able to b made every day. Not to mention, what would happen if you didn't use computers and a fire occured? All of your hard work will be turned into ash, but if it was on the computer you be able to retrieve it. You can save anything on a computer. Another reason why computers have a positive affect on people is because throught the internet you can visually experience places or things you couldn't before. If I was going to book a vacation I wouldn't just trust a book, I would wont to go on the computer so I could see pictures, videos, or hundreds of other articles I couldn't see anywhere else. This goes for anything else like furniture, instruments or even cloths. Computers offer alternative views that books don't. Not only can computers save data and give you visuals, but they give you an oportunity to catch up with old friends, relatives, or even meet new people! Instead of endlessly searching through phone books you can just type in their name and you bound to find somewhere on the internet. Popular websites like @CAPS1 make this extremely easy. When my dad was in search of his childhood friend he typed his name on @CAPS1 and ended up calling him @NUM1 minutes later! That wouldn't have been possible without computers. Computers truley do have a positive affect on people everywhere without them many things today wouldn't be possible. Hopefully others will agree with me too.",10
736,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3't it about time we start thinking more about the digital age. Computers has contributed so much to society for many years and up to this point I don't believe the world would be able to function without it.Some people say that computers @CAPS3't good for society but do they really believe that computers gave us the internet, email, most jobs depend on the internet, even games, and many more let me explain. First of all without computers there would be no internet and without that many jobs would fail. Most jobs need the internet to work like architects need the computer to design buildings and houses. Almost every office has computers for many different reasons. Writers need the computers to wright books, if they were hand writen some people might not be able to read it, so if there was no computers thousands of people would loose their jobs. My mothers works on a computer she would loose her job. Not only that but we need computers for school. If I had to write a paper on a person it would be almost impossible to do without looking up information about him on the internet. Also with writing a paper, some teachers only exept typed papers. How are we suppost to do that if we didn't have computers that makes home work a lot easier. Lastly, computers lets us explore new places. Goole @LOCATION1 is a map of every place on @LOCATION1 that we can see. If you need to find out where something is you can always count on the internet. If you need direction you can print them out off the internet. Also if you need to find out what somthing means instead of using an dictionary use the computer. Now can you see how much the computer benefits society. Some people say that other people take too long on the computer but you don't have to. I don't know any one that uses the computer for more then work or school.",9
737,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 is a rumor going around saying that computers are a negitive affect in a childs life. I disagree. A computer can help a kid in so many ways, it can help students with homework, let students talk to friends, and help with school projects. And besides, most kids don't don't stay on the computer very long anyways. Homeworks, it's a big role in school, if you don't do it or worse don't get it can you down. That's why computers have websites that help a child learn how do do a problem or a social studies question if they don't know. If you go to the school web page then theres a link that brings you in a math games. Theres even a to a science website. This helps a child so they don't get stressed out over homework. A computer also helps a students interact with friends. A social life is very important to a @NUM1 grater. This is where a computer can have aim, facebook, and even myspace help a kid impact with friends. If a kid got into a fight at school can come home and to work it out and not leave it unseatled. A computer also new friends from other towns. Teens need to and make new friesnd will helps as in life. If a teen helps with a then they can ask a for help. Every student gets a take home project at social point in the time of running out to the store to buy paper and pencils. you can stay home, have money and typee the essay. Computers can help with a social studies or a science project. You can print pictures and find information. Drawing can be a hastle and messy, so it saves time and the mess. If @CAPS1 are words you dont understandd then you can look them out. Computers are and best way to do a project. Computers, everyone uses them, they help our parents just as much as uss. They help us with homework, let us talk to friends, and even help us do our projects! Computers are one of the best technology we have @DATE1.",8
738,"Computers have many effects on people these days. Most of them are very good effects that can lead you to become more self-confident. Computers can educate people, from learning about some ancient person to doing school projects. Also computers entertain people too. Lastly it can even increase you chances of finding a job or helping out your job. For most people education is very important to but since kids don't stay in school @NUM1 they use the computer to teach to kids kids can learn about other places. This benefits us because we're learning something and growing out our knowledge. Also kids can do their projects. For example writing on essay, their science fair project and so on. Lastly kids can learn about people from other times. For example famous musicians long ago, celebrities, legends, hall of famers etc. People always look for some kind of entertainment and the first place they ever go is the computer. Everyone likes enetertainment and the computer in the the best plan. They could play a variety of games. Games from the past or gaems from the future. There is also a whole bunch of : multiplayer, figure, castle defense, shnaler sports, racing, acade, and so on. Another fun thing to do is interact with friends online or even talk to any family don't live near you. Lastly, you could watch funny videos, sad videos and music videos. Another that computers effect people is their of finding or help on their . the computer can teach people what they will do on their job, and what to expect. Also, it can let you search for jobs. In your. Finally, it can help them for allowing them to a web page. In conclusions computers have people. It can increase their education, give them entertainment, and even help out on their job, or help them find a job.",8
739,"Dear town of southing ton, Computers our town are very important for instance. For all of the banks we have computers and for almost every job. We need computers for life, and that doesn'@CAPS1 make use lazy and forget full it makes us busy. The only situation with someone who is online being lazy is with a teenager playing games. But the only reason some kids do that is because they all dont want to go and exercise or run around with their family who they see everyday. But because they want to talk to their friends make plans and just talk while they play togeather. If someone is ignoring their family or becomeing more lazy, it is because that is their choice to sit around and do nothing. And I do agree that people are becomeing over weight but I think that is because some people consider a workout to be an hour of lifting and running once a week. And that isn'@CAPS1 right. I think that this news paper should post up adds about gyms and maybe that will lower the faty meter in our town. or if they think people are neglecting their families have people work less so they can go home and see their families. As for teens I think you parents out there need to set some rules like @NUM1 hours of play a day, @NUM2 hours on a @DATE1, and if they don'@CAPS1 listen take the game away for a day of two, but that might not get them to spend time with you because they @MONTH1 be mad, but it will get them outside or atleast doing somehting more active and not watching @CAPS1.V. or playing video games all day. Also I know this from expieriance becouse I am a teanager and I always go outside and run around when my parents take my games away, and it's @PERSON1 that of homeworld. Please take my advise and your happy caring family will always stay togeather and active and not always sitting on the computer stressing over work and playing videos games.",8
740,"I think that it is fine that people spend a lot of time on the computer instead of having time to exercise, enjoy nature and interact with family and friends because it is the persons choice to either stay on the computer all day or go outside. Computers affect peoples lives in good ways and bad ways. People stay inside all day and do nothing besides sit there and just click buttons. Good ways is that it educates you in many ways because @CAPS1 your on the computer watching or reading interesting things you could end up learning something before you learn it in school. Its good to go on the computer for a little a bit but @CAPS1 your on it all day then you could have no exercise and become lazy and fat. But @CAPS1 you go outside sometimes you wont have to worry because you are getting exercise that helps out your body. I think computers are a great way to have fun. You can chat with your friends, @CAPS1 you have a webcam you can video chat with friends. A cmputer is a great way for communication. Millions of people use a computer for working at their @CAPS2. Without computers life would be ten times harder for people in this world. People like accountants use computer for there job. They store data into the computer to remember things @CAPS1 you couldn't write it down on a piece of paper, People also make websites on the internet to help educate, like @CAPS1 you type in a word it could give you a definition, People also make @CAPS4 engines, @CAPS4 engines are some engine on a website that searches for things you type in. @CAPS1 you type in something you will get what you were looking for. My whole point of explaining this is that its the peoples choice @CAPS1 they would like to be on all the time. Because computers and internet connections arn't free. It doesn't even do anything bad to your brain. It mostly educates it. People even go to school online they learn and study on things that are on the internet. Plus you could get @CAPS2 at places for working with computers, You could make programs, and anything you would want. So my statement here is that its okay to spend alot of time on your computer instead of exercizing going to see friends and family and enjoy nature. I think that computers are fine and it doesn't matter how long your on it, it just depends @CAPS1 your learning and not playing games all day and being lazy and get fat.",9
741,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you probably have seen there is a lot of controversy over wether computers are helpful or harmful. I for one agree computers are helpful because, they help you learn about new things, talk to people around the world, and try new things. For instance have you ever wondered what the capital of @LOCATION6 is? Well with the you could find that answer in the blink of an eye, that's because the internet gives you unparraellel information that no book has. The internet seally lets you see what is happening in or world because there are various news sources, and blogs on the internet, @PERSON1 do you remember the earthquake in @LOCATION4 well I sure do, because I found it out on the internet. You can also find directions to places, sports stats and about different places. Well whats a better way to find out a bout those than talking with people who live there? I don't think anything is, seriously is it better reading about @LOCATION5 or talking to someone in @LOCATION5? Thats the beauty of the internet is it bonds the world together into a tighter realationship, I remember chatting with people from @LOCATION3 while the gold medal game @PERSON3. Sure some people would say that you could meet someone in person from a different country, well how would you meet someone from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1, because I never have. People could say go to the place to talk to the person and, with the internet, it's very possible. Have you @PERSON1 wanted to go to @PERSON4? Well with the internet all you need is your credit card and you could be there tomorrow because the internet allows you to try new things. Have you ever wanted to try pingpong, it so you could or does a set offline and have it shipped to you in a couple of days, I always wanted to go to a zoo but, I didn't know of any, so I used the internet and see school for zoos near @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1 and before I could move the results for @PERSON2 zoo were right infront of me. That is why the internet is very helpful. To sum it all up the internet is very helpful to people who use it correctly, but I agree that the internet can be inappropriate. With blackson the not needed sites the internet can do almost anything.",9
742,"@CAPS2 people think, the invention of computer, and the internet is a terrify thing, but truly @CAPS6 is terrible time consumer. The local newspaper is doing a survay about peoples opinion about technology. People spend way to much time on computers while they could be outside, enjoying nature, excercising, or interacting with people in person. The advancements in technology just wasteing your time. When the weather is people should be out side enjoying @CAPS6 instead of wasteing time day on the @CAPS1 sun can be very harmful to your skin, seen the sun can help and boost you energy, the carbon dioxide in buildings causes people to become sleepy. @PERCENT1 of people survayed by @ORGANIZATION1 sold they feell more when they go outside. @CAPS2 people People are while they could be excercising obesitey is a people sit at the computer all day, @CAPS6 contributes to the @CAPS2 kids have stopped participating the much computer. @PERCENT2 of people by the @CAPS3 computer people spend and friends. they see inperson, people will forget their manners because they are not used online. People who support computer usage might say. That their are ways to talk @CAPS3 @CAPS4, ect. But online chatting @CAPS5't always safe, @CAPS1 on your buddy list @CAPS6 @MONTH1 friends out unless you can see their face, you can Computers have become to much of a distraction to the society. Computers have caused people to forget ow to use manners and communicate in the real world. Now is the time to get on your feet and find something else to do! Responsible towns people are.",9
743,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 we all know more and more people are using computers. Some believe that this would be a concern because it affects peoples health. I believe that with the advances in technology it would give us positive effects on people. Here are three reasons why, first would be that with advances in tech. It would teach us to be more intelligent. Second would be it it would give us the ability to have access to intresting things we can't get at the library like biographics and finally access to communicate online. My first reason @CAPS2 I mentioned before was it would give us intelligence. If we have questions to something we dont know we could search on the computer and find our answer. We would learn this and would be able to teach others. The computer can give us alot of useful information that can benefit us in the future. My second reason is that advance in tech. would help us because it give us access to helpful website that teaches us. Not all information is found in the library the computer has access to biographics educational website and most important the access to educational advances for example online tutoring for students with difficulties in school. My third and final reason why advance in tech. would and could benefit us is that it gives us access to online communication. Some people will have e-mail for good reason for example teachers have e-mail for educational cause if a student is having problem in work, the student simply send the teacher a e-mail of the what the students difficulty is and what the student can do. That is all I have to say for now. I hope you think about this",7
744,"Dear Newspaper people, I'm here to tell you that computers have a bad effect on people. The computer @MONTH1 hold lots of information but does it always hold the right information? You could do lots of other stuff than lay on the computer. Also, the computer is very distracting. The computer @MONTH1 give you the wrong info. Instead of going through the process of turning on your computer, search for the info and turn it off takes more time than find a book, open it, find the info close it and put it back. Books more often are correct. Computers take time to find into than a book. Computers give you too much information than a book. There's plenty of other stuff to do than play on the computer. You could read a book or draw. You could also play outside and shoot hoops or ride your bike. You can call up your friends and play with them. If you're really bored and you don't know what to do, make up a game. At times, computers could distract you. If you want to get homework done and you have a computer, it gets you off topic. If you're at work with a computer, it's tempting. Even other people on computers is distracting. if you're working on the computer, it does not take much to to take the thing you need to search like @ORGANIZATION1 and change it to something you want to search like @ORGANIZATION1 company. See what I mean by a negative effect? It doesn't give you the right info always, you could do better things in life and is very distracting. It is what makes the workers to the procrastinators and the fit to the lazy. Computers have entered our world and have altered all of our lives! Computers have made a big change to everyday life. Please agree with me.",8
745,"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper I'm writing a letter to you about how I feel about the effects that computers have on people. One of my reasons is that people that spend to much time on the computers they are litting their lifes pass by them. But the people that work on computers all day is a different thing. My second reason is that people could be on the computers and still interact with their family because they live with each other. My last reason is why do people want to be on computers all day. I'm not talking about the people that work on computer. My last reason is that the people that is spending all their time on the computer they are letting their lifes pass by there. The reason I say this is because if you are on the computer @NUM1 your life is passing by you. Because you are not doing nothing, just sitting in a chair in the computer getting fat. Also if you are going to be on the computer at least they to find a job on the computer. But I'm not talking about the people that work in computer all day long, because they have to do it. Its their job to. Thats one of my reasons. My second reason is that the people this me in the computer they still interact with their family. The reasons I say this is because you could be on the computer and will interact with my family because you live it the same huge as them, two when you are not in the computer you could be with your family and spend time with them. That's why i said that you still could interact with your family even you see on the computer. The last and final reason is do people to spend most of their lifes on the computer. The person I like this because type of person would spend most of their life on the computer and don't go find a job go enjoy their life. Also if you got kids you have fun with your children and make them believe that they parents that was to them, that, they had fun with them, and that they had somebody that they could look up too. So don't spend your life time on the computer geting fat, not spending time with their children and make something yourselfs. But I'm not talking about the people that workon computers. I'm talking about the people that don't work on computers. Thats why I said don't let youre life pass by you. i hope you liked the prompt and that you wont spend a lot of your life in the computer doing nothing just getting fat and letting your life pass you. I'll report myself again I'm not talking about the people that have to work in the computer. I'm talking about the people that don't work in computers.",8
746,"Dear readers, @CAPS1 if I told you that every time you sit in front of a computer, you are that much closer to death? @CAPS1 if I said that computers are destroying your lives? This @MONTH1 not be that serrws, but its shocking. You can not disagree. I feel that humans should not use computers, or at least use them very scarcely. Computers make people get less exercise, they kill brain cells, and they can ruin your lifestyle. You @MONTH1 believe computers have impared your life, but consequences remain. Many @CAPS2 today are obese and lazy. They don't get any exercise. There are many reasons for this, but one big reason is because they sit in front of computers all day! Computers @MONTH1 improve reflexes and such but you can do that by exercising, also! When you sit in front of a computer, it reels you in. Ten minutes becomes one hour in a snap! That is one less hour of exercise. Virtual sports @MONTH1 be fun, but they keep you from the real ones. Without exercise, one @MONTH1 become obese, develop diabetes or heart problems or even have muscle troubles. These can be hazardous, and even deadly. Computers dont exercise your body, or your mind! Now, that fact bring me to my next point. Computers @MONTH1 have information to teach you, but that type of learning has its consequences. When you sit in front of a computer, your eyes are on the screen. Now, scientists from the @ORGANIZATION1 foundation have found they staring at the screen kills brain cells. Basically, these cells do not reporoduce as easily as other cells, and they sometimes don't reproduce at all. You are just one step closer to death. I'm sure you don't want an death. Try opening a book! They are cheaper, more accurate, and don't kill your cells! Don't stare at the computer screen, because your slowly destroying your body, and knowledge can be gained elsewhere. For a final point, I would like to say that computers simply destroy your lifestyle. Virtual people are not your real friends and family. Computers cause you to turn away from them. Online interaction is not like just talking to someone in person or on the phone. You can lose your real friends. Plus, computers run your lifestyle because half the things you think you are learning arent real. You can't trust certain sites or certain people. Being with ones you know and love is much more beneficial, because computers drag you in you are taken away from the real world. I feel that we should all take a stand against computers. They take away exercise, cause brain cells to die and other problems occur, and they can ruin your lifestyle. No one wants to be a lonely joke! Read a book, get outside and day; but stay away from die screen. There are better alternatives. Take a stand, and do @CAPS1 is best. Be the healthy, happy person, and lay off that computers, so that you can get the best of life!",10
747,"I strolled into my bedroom, I noticed the computer sitting on a wonder desk. I thought that computers are very helpful. There are many controversies on whether computes benefit or do not benefit society. My opinion on this topic is that computers are useful and I support this technology. Computers are excellent tools that could help students with work in school. For instance, this year I had a sciences project about how my hobbies interests are related to science. One of my interests in reading, @CAPS1 I had to research about how reading a simple back can be related to science. I went on the internet, typed in my question about reading, and two seconds later thousands of results up. I had even gotten some pictures too. A couple of days later after I had handed in my project, I recieved it back. I had gotten a @NUM1 on this project! @CAPS1 being able to use a computer really boosted my grade in science. Without the internet, I probably wouldn't have been able to get on A on this. As you can see, computers can help students with projects, etc. in school. Using this technology can help you reconnect with friends and family members. In elementary school, my friend @PERSON1 had moved away to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2. I had no way of communicating with her until I found a program on the internet that lets you chat with people. Both of us had been using this and we've been able to talk for on end. I don't see @PERSON1 as often as I had used to, but with my computer wide open in my bedroom I can chat online with her almost everyday. Computers can help re-establish old relationships with friends and family. @CAPS1 communicating on these are also another benefit. Using computers can help enrich peoples minds. For example, in school we use a program called, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4."" @CAPS3 @CAPS4 involves you playing games that help you @CAPS3, and tests when you are ready to take them. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 has been helping us practice for the @ORGANIZATION1's. After taking multiple tests in subjects such as science, math, and language arts, I now feel confident about taking the @ORGANIZATION1's and I believe I am going to do well on these tests. As you can tell, the tool of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 on the computer can benefit your school grades. The effect computers have an people are that they help and benefit the society. I think that more citizens should own computers because they can expand your knowledge. I am clearly in favor of owning and using computers.",8
748,"To whom this @MONTH1 concern: I heard that people are having a debate to tell whether computers benefit us or are bad for us. I think that computers are great. They allow us to talk with people all over the world. They give us the ability to learn about things. Lastly, they save us money. Aren't these all things benefit us? I think so. Please keep reading to hear more about why computers are good. First off, computers give us the ability to talk with people all over the world. A lot of my family lives in different @CAPS1, and thats how I talk to them is through the computer. If you move away from all your friends and family, wouldn't you want to still keep intouch with them? Well you could by chatting with them on the computer. To keep the ball rolling, computers give us the oppirtunity to learn about different things. If I go on ""@CAPS2.com"", I could type in anything I want, and get information about it. Or I get an answer to a question. Are you a parent that wants to know how their child is doing in school? You could go to their school website and check their grades in each class they have. To wrap it all up, computers save us money everyday. If you needed to look up information for a project without a computer, you would have to drive all the way to the library and buy a book. But with a computer, you could get information easy in the convienience of your own home. In conclusion, you could see that computers benefit us in many ways. Thay give us the ability to talk to friends and family all around the world. They give us the oppirtunity to look up information quick and easy. Lastly, they save us money everyday. Thank you for reading my letter, which I'm sure has persuaded you to think that computers are a good thing.",8
749,"One girl sits by her computer doing homework. Another girl with her computer, talks to her friends. Those girls are doing activitys that make our world more productive. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers help people with hand-eye cordination, learn about faraway places, and talk with others online. This is what computers can do to help our socity become better. Firstly, the computer can teach us hand-eye cordination. By playing games , we can use what we learn in real life. A boy can play football on line, then take what he learned and use that in a real football game. Hand-eye cordination on the computer can help us to learn new things about our society. We could use what we learned to discover new things and help us to make the community, as a whole, . These skills can also help us do more things at once. Multitasking is a difficult task to and with hand-eye cordination and computers it becomes easier. A second productive task can help us with is learning . Some people dont know going on in The computer can direct us to news The computer is literally like one huge look of use . Another positive effect that computers have on people is communication. Many people have a twitter, facebook , myspce, etc. and all those websites can help . Products like skpe, video chat , aim and email allow people to have a conversation online. Email is something that there are so many new ides. You cannot only talk you can do business, send pictures, invitations, and announcements. Schools, offices, and companys all over the world use these products and it doesn't only make society better it makes the world better. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on people around the world. They can help with hand eye cordination, help you learn about far away places, and they help people communicate.

750,"Dear editor, @TIME1 week, I noticed an article in the paper headlined ""@CAPS1 off the computer and go exercise."" This caught me off gaurd because there are many benefits to computers, such as it enchances education, you can learn about foreign countries, and you can talk to other people. Every school has a computer. Their easy access and very helpful. I know that @TIME1 year, if someone asked a question and the teacher wasn't sure of it, we would go strait to the computer. It also helps us do better on projects. I know I had to do a project @TIME1, and without the computer I wouldn't have it today. We also use the computers for the programs they have. In art, we made a cartoon, and made it look real with photoshop. It's also easy and fast to use a computer for research. You can also learn ahead far away places with a computer. For example, you can find out about other countries in the world. You could find out if it were landlocked, not landlocked, how many people live there, and facts similar to those. You can also learn the history about the country such as their leaders and government. Finally, you can also learn up-to-the minute-facts with websites like @CAPS2.com. Lastly, you can talk with other people using email, instant messaging, and websites like facebook, which allows you to connect with friends. With email, you talk with someone for buisness for to recieves links to @CAPS1 to websites, and to @CAPS1 information. Instant messaging is just like texting on your phone, except much faster. You can instantly talk to people and catch up with them. Thousands of people are on facebook. You can connect with old friends, and talk to current ones. I knkow my mom uses facebook and talks to old friends since she moved. So, in my opinion, I think computers are a good thing to have. Not only do they enhance your education, but they also teach us foreighn countries history and let us connect to old friends. When you were in school, do you remember your ""best-friend-for-life?"" @CAPS3, with facebook you can catch up with them, instead of them being a memory.",9
751,"Are computers benefiting society? I believe that computers are actually not benifiting society. In this article I will explain how you will recieve less time exersising, less time with your family and friends, and less time enjoying nature just by being on you computers to much. If you are one of those people that love to be on the computer as much as you can? Well, think of it this way. You spend so much time on the computer that you recieve little or no exercise! Everyone needs to recieve a little bit of exercise in order to fit and healthy. Our country's obesity level has gone up since our high-tech computers have come out. I believe that this is one main reasons of obesity. This is a major concern in our high-tech, computer society today. Besides you recieving less exercise, you will also recieve less time with your family and friends. I understand with your family could talk to them on facebook but you need interaction by talking face to face. This is one of our basic needs as an individual. Your family is going to be by your side no matter what. But you need to build a strong relationship with your family in order for them to be there for you. This is only going to happen if you interact face to face with them. The same thing goes for friends. This is another nacessity for basic needs!!!! Everyone should have some relationship. Lastly, everyone needs to enjoy nature! It is a beautiful sight that everyone needs to expirence. Being trapped inside the house to be on your computer is a terrible thing to do. The beauties of nature are amanding everybody but @NUM1 of people don't take the opportunity to enjoy it. Being outside and enjoying yourself is a big thing for your body to survive. You need to sook up the powerful rays of the sun and have a life changing look around nature. But @CAPS1 of this will happen if you stay on your computer @NUM2. In conclusion, computers are not benifiting society. People recieve little or no exercise, interaction with friends of family, and a chance to enjoy nature. Everyone nedds to have these needs instead of fucusing all on the computer.",8
752,"The computer effects peoplelife by taking them away from their family and have is @NUM1 reasons why the computer effect the people lives. @NUM2) They do not know what is happening outside. @NUM3) Their family @NUM1). Their job. Please listen to my reason why the computer effect people lives! My first reason their they don't know what happening out ide because they are to much busy on the computer. Their friends could of won something important and they wanted you to be their but no they are just so busy on the computer. They are going to miss out of nature or hanging out with friends. Like if they are meeting one at a place and they said they if just means they were on the computer all day long. My second reason is theie family. I said their family because they could miss out on a lot of things. Such as a family reunion, a family vacation and many more. It like if one of their family members hurt and they are trying to call you but you dont picking up the phone because you to busy on the computer to pick it up. You can lose your wife cause the computer because you forgot her birthday, her and her because you are on the stupid computer. About their kids, what happens if they want to playing they have nothing also to do card their? Say no cause you computer. They family will get rewing. My third and last reason is their job. They can lose their job cause your missed work cause your on the computer for doing nothing work cause computer. If they lose their jobs they can pay for they can't use their computer. They are going to be in their house with no light and no computer cause they have on it to much and did not pay attention was happening. They akk to feel like they are going to cause they dont have their computer. Or the computer shot doen and he cant enough money to get a electriction. Those were all ny reasons. @NUM2) they don't know what is happening outside. @NUM3) their family @NUM1) Their job. Thank you for listening to my reasons.",8
753,"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, Are computers really as great as they seem? It seems to me that they are used way too much in people's lives, and that computers are distractions that don't allow people to di ceratin things in their life that they would if they weren't always on the computer. People's lives are starting to revolve around going on the computer, checking your facebook, and looking at new videos on @CAPS2.com. I know from experience facebook or myspace can be very addicting. I'll spend hours commenting on pictures or new wall posts, and then at @NUM1 pm I've realized I haven't begun any of my loads of homework. This happens quite often, and I end up staying awake until around @NUM2. The following moring I wake up at @NUM3 am, exhausted. I am not exaggerating either, this happens to many of my friends, and if you have kids, ask them because I am @PERCENT1 sure they are on facebook or @CAPS3 all night. This doesn't just happen with kids either, my mom just got a facebook and she is hooked to it, even more than I am. Sometimes it can be come a competition to see who has the most pictures, or the most friends. Kids start adding people as friends that they don't even know computers aren't just distractions, they are also very dangerous. At my school we had assembly where they showed us how easy it was to find out someone's personal information, Even if you don't have your address or your phone number listed, there are many other ways to track you down. If you take a picture right after you won the championship soccer game, in your jersey. Just that one picture shows your team name, your last name, and your number. Anyone could easily search all that stuff on the internet and know exactly where your next game be. As the local newspaper @CAPS1, I am sure you must be concerned about the safety of the town, or even your own kids. Some people @MONTH1 say ""that would never happen to me"" but it easily could, especially if you're constantly on your computer. I have noticed that a lot of teens around my age are starting to become obsessed with being on the computer. A lot of times in families, instead of spending time together. syblings are fighting over who gets to go on the computer. One sybling @MONTH1 need it for homework, while the other just wants to talk to her friends on @CAPS3 and each believes they deserves the computer. Computers are starting to interest a lot with people's lives, in a negative way. Once again they are distracting, dangerous and hurt families. Computers hurt society more than it helps. And maybe you should look into how much time your kids are spending on the computer. ",9
754,"There has been a debate weather computers benefit society or hurt society. I personnaly agree with th statement that computers benefit in society. I think that computers do improve your hand-eye coordination. When you can type fast and accuratly you know your hand eye coordination is doing well. I remeber as a kid I would watch my grandmother type about seventy-five words per minute. Just from her year of practice, she becamr very computer coordinated. My hand-eye coordination is becoming a lot better because I have types for a long time. Scientists say that @PERCENT2 or people that type for at least four years become better hand-eye coordinated typing fast keeps your fingers quick and agile. I once read a book on computers and an expert said ""the invention of the computer keyboard could possibly be the greates hand-eye coordination practice ever."" @CAPS1 plus about computers is that they allow you to learn about far away places wtihout really going there. In school you can do projects on other countries without traveling just by using a computer. I once had to do a class project on @LOCATION1 and got a @PERCENT1 just by using a computer, people can look up information on countries for pleasure too. Mu mom just wanted to learn about @LOCATION2 so she just looked it up on the internet from her computer. You can research schoold too. My older sister went online to bok at collges without acctually traveling to the actual college states. Finally one more thing you can do on a computer is talk to people online. There is such a thing as @CAPS2-mail which allows you to write people over the internet on the computer. I remember when my baseball coach was going to tell me I made the team he just @CAPS2-mailed my parents because it was the most simple way to get it done. There is also such a thing as @CAPS4 (instant messaging) that allows you to imediatly talk to somebody and for them to immidiatly talk to you back. I remeber I used to go on @CAPS4 everyday to talk to friends. Also you can video chat which allows you to directly see somebody and actually talk to them physically. I read a news article on video chatting and an expert said ""video chatting is the single best way to communicate with someone without being right inforn of them talking with them. These reasons are why I think computers are a big help in our society.",8
755,"Dear readers, People around the world are starting to use computers now more, often, but theirs also people that dont agree that it benefits society, @CAPS1 not one of those people. I agree that this benefits society. One reason why I agree is because sometimes theirs teens and even adults that can chat online with their friends if they cant contact them in any other way. Another reason is because in all school teacher give their students project to do over vacation or weekends, for the projects they can look for information in the computer. The last reason is because computers can give ability to learn more about things they didnt know before. In my opinion I agree with computers benefiting society. Teens, kids and even adults would like to talk with their friends so they can get on the computer and chat with them if theirs no other way to contact them, @CAPS2 easy. You only have to @NUM1) get in the computer, @NUM2) get into a site were you know your friend might be @NUM3) log in or register in if you never been into that site @NUM4) last but not least look @NUM4 your friend to chat will teachers always give their students work for example like projects. Kids also do projects on weekends or vacation and so you dont have to go to a library to check out a book you could always get on the computer and look for the information you need their. Computers give you abilitys to learn information you didnt know before for example if your bored and you dont got nothing to do get in the computer and look up information about things like nature, books your looking for etc. I agree with computers benefiting society but not everyone, @NUM3 reason why I agree is kids can chat online with their friends, look up information for projects and find information they never knew about, what do you think @CAPS1 I right or wrong.",7
756,"To who this @MONTH1 concern, In my opinion, computers have greatly improved our lives. Therefore I believe that owning and using a computer is for the greater good. Three reasons that support my decision are that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily, they allow us to connect with people in far away places, and they help us to learn more about life and the planet we live on. Please consider my reasons when making your decision. My first reason is that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily. This in turn allows us to get more done. For example lets say that your doing a report on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You could run out to the library and look through hundreds of books and newspapers or you could just sit down at your at your computer, open up a web browser, and type a ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" into the search box. Within a few seconds you will have searched hundreds more libraries newspapers and even other computers to find information on your topic. You can also look for information on videos. Old newscasts, inteveiws, documeteries, you name it. It's all there right at your fingertips. My second reason is that it allows people in far away places to connect. If I said that to my mom she would probably tell me to go use the phone, but computers can do everyhing a phone can do and more. You ca share photos, videos, games, just about anything. Recently, I joined facebook and I now can talk to people I haven't seen in years who moved away I was born. Over the @DATE1 I had gone to my @CAPS3. My dad introduced me to his uncle who shared the same name as me. Then about month's later I got a friend request from a @CAPS4 who up in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, which is far from where I live, and now lives in. After talking to him for a while I learned that he was, the son of mydaduncle. If it weren't for my computer I would have never met him. Also,I recently learned and am getting pretty good. So one day my friends look me through a which has all it,. We began video taping a posting. So the computer has also allowed us to what without them having to be there. My third and final reason is that the computer allows us learn how to improve our lives and the planet we live on. Many people say that if you on the computer all the time you'll become fat and lazy,but that isn't always the case. I have actually been able to improve my exercise rutine byuseing the computer. Whenever I go out for a run, I can come home and find out exactly how far I ran, how many calories I burned, and anything else I want to know. I have also been able to find new more effective excersizes that allow me to target different muscles. Now lets talk about what we can learn about our planet. We can use a computer to find weather patters which allows us to plan our days accordingly. We can also use it to learn about news happening around the world. For example, the day of the earthquake in @LOCATION2, I opened up in my homepage and there it was and I was able to learn about what had happened. Finally a computer allows us to learn different cultures around the world. We can learn about how ancient egiptions lived, how the people in @LOCATION3 or @CAPS5 make money or how they construct their houses. All the things we would never know if we didn't have a computer. In conclusion, computers have improved the lives of the human race by a great deal. They have allowed us and how to improve our lives. I hope that this letter has helped you come to a decision about the effects a computer has on people lives.",10
757,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern: I think computers have a great effect on people. Computers are useful for homework, it allows you to keep in touch with out of state family, you can also look up direction and information to a place. Computers are good for last minute situations. Computers are very useful for homework because when you type a report it looks more professial. While you type a report you can also research on your project at the same time. In some cases there are people who write very slappy to a paint where he or she cannot read his own writing nor can a teacher. A sloppy writer can use the computer to make his or her paper neat. If a child or parent cannot go to the library for some reason they can use their computer at home. If you are a parent at home busy with kids and need to do work; there's no need to go anywhere stay home and use your computer. If a child is absent from school you can go to the school's website and find out the homework. Do you have out of state family you wish to talk to? If so wouldn't you want to be a able to talk to them without a expensive phonebill? A majority of people would say yes. Using the computer to keep touch with family is not so expensive at all! Some examples are aim, emails, and other networks and they don't cast money at all its free. When there's a day you have nothing to do, don't you just want to go somewhere for fun? Don't you want to do something just to get out of the house? Well if there's a last minute decision or situation the computers there to help. Before you go somewhere and you want know a little more go on the computers. Not only will you get information on the place you can also get directions. Now you can go somewhere instead of staying home bored. In conclusion, computers do have a great effect on people. It can be useful to both adults and children. Teachers can calculate students averages easier and faster and children can do their homework efficiently. You can also keep in touch with friends. Overall computers are useful.",8
758,"Dear local Newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on people. My first reason is that some people at college are far away from home like my sister and my family talks to her through the computer. Also many people have an email! that tells them about sales at grocery stores or clothing stors and it saves people money using those cupons. Statistics state that grownups that use the computer at night feel more awake in the @TIME1. My second reason is that if someone is going on vacation or they are moving they can go on the internet and find out if where there going is safe or if they have a nice school there and they can learn about the place and see what it looks like. they can also find out about colleges and see how nice they are see if its a small school if there are alot of kids that go to that school and etc. My third and final reason is that when people use the computer there. hand eye coordination gets better because when your typing your moving your fingers and your geting the feeling when you use it and your geting faster at typing. Also your not just siting there your moving your fingers and your using your brain. Scholastic kids states that kids who use the the computer and use the keyboark brings there @CAPS1 up @NUM1 points. in conclusion I dont think that the computer has a bad effect after your done reading thise I hope you agree with me.",8
759,"Dear readers, I right to you today about the effects of computer usage. I feel that there are some positive and some negative effects from using the computer. You can talk to people, and you can get work done, but if you are at this to much you'll be starting to gain bad health and miss other things in life. Throughout the computer, there is many ways to communicate with others, which is an amazing thing. Whether it be through a game, typing or real chatting, it's very important to talk to people and this makes things much easier than going out nad talking to people face to face. For, example penpals, over the years people have written letters to their penpals, but know you can send it over mail and email doesn't cost any money, just type up your letter click a button and done. Another positive point about computers is that you're able to get work done on it. From work for a business to school work, it doesn't matter. You bear of people using computers to do work all of the time. Why do you think there are computer labs at school or desks with computers in offices. Computers have become advanced and the easiest thing to get things done with. Presentations, essays, graphs, anything. A concern I have of the computer is that people are becoming to addicted to computers. Many younger people are overusing computers wich leads to bad health. When people sit in front of a computer screen all day only getting up to grab something to eat, people will because obese. To stall healthy people need to be outside and exercise. We need to make rules to keep people out in the open out to give the generation a healthy life. So, I have mixed feelings about computers. They can be amazing for a while but only for a while. And if you can't see this open your eyes",8
760,"I think that computers are very valueable and help a lot of people I think that computers should be used for information that could help students with their homework or to study for a test and also for adults to look up things such as directions, adresses, and prices of clothes and other items. They are also good because they help you communicate with friends and help people make plans to do with friends. However some people should limit themselves on things like facebook and twitter, some people spend too much time on those things and should limit themselves to just @NUM1 minutes a day on those sites. One of the reasons I think computers are good is because some students might not now the answer to something on their homework and could use the computer to find out the answers. Another reason why computer can be very valueable to all students is because lets say a student has a quiz on mitusis and cells in science the next day and doesnt really understand it they could use the computer to learn about it and do good on their quiz. Another reason that computer are good for people is because it helps them communicate with theri friends. Some kids are only and arent that gool at interacting with people in person. But these social networking sites help them come out of their shells and make them a little less shy and make more friends. however like I said earlier some poepleget carried away and spend too much time doing this kind of stoffs and should limit themselves to just @NUM1 minutes per day on these social networking sites. Some people use their computers for other important things like buying things and getting directions and adresses. If somebody want to go to a store in a different town but didnt know where it was they could up the address an dthen find the directions to that place some people also use the computer to purchase things like groceriess and clothes. Sometimes people save money because they buy something online a sale than going to a store and paying anymore money. As you can see the computer has a lot of positives. Therefore I encourage you to support computers, because they are so useful and valuable.",8
761,"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are high tech devises that allow us to connect with friends and family in other places like france or @LOCATION2, allow us to research new information, perhaps for a school project in school project in school and even play addicting games, Computers have moderized our life, and it's affect on human being is dispicable.

762,"Each year the world becomes more and more advance in technology. Technology helps and benefits us all in a good positive way. Computers are apart of this positive technology and definetely benefits society. Computers help us look up places and things we never seen before and teaches us about them, too. In addition, computers have a positive impact on families and benefits them greatly. Also, they help people from adults years out of college to teenagers in high school communicate with their friends. Therefore, computers help us all in some little way and makes life easier and more fun. To begin with computers helps us expand our knowledge. It us helps us look up facts or recent news quickly. For example, just recently the @DATE1 @CAPS1 occured and they usualy go late into the night so I didn't get to see the whole competition. I could just easily go look it up on the computer to see who won which medals. computers helped me by looking up the medals quick so I woudn't have to wonder who won a medals not. Computers help us expand our knowledge all the time. They help us look up facts for report, places we want to travel to, learn about the benefits of a certain pet and the posibilities can be endless. to continue with, computers help families by bringing them closer in a way. A family member could be watching a funny on youtube or @ORGANIZATION1 and could think its so funny that they want their whole family to see it you. In addition, stores sell clothes online now so mother and daugther can sit down together and shop without leaving the house. Computers bring my family together by we rent movies from @LOCATION1 on the computer. It brings us together when choose and pick which movie to rent. Also, it brings us together to have a family movie night. As a result, these things the computer gives brings out discussion in the family and gives a good topic that everyone can relate to and talk about. Another way computers are beneficial is they bring everyone together. There are many ways communicate on the computer these days. There is facebook, twitter, email, aim, and many more. They are all different, but they have one thing in common is to bring old friends and new friends together. For instance my mom just sign on to be in facebook so she can talk to all her old friends from highschool and she found one really good friends who she hasn't seen in ages it made her really happy. Therefore, it shows that computers aren't just for bringing new people together, old ones, too.",10
763,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, Computers can be a great asset to our society, but they are an even, bigger hindrance. People are wasting their days away on the computer. Hardly anyone goes out in exercise, or to enjoy nature. Perhaps the sea west effect is that hardly anyone interacts with their friends and family anymore. @CAPS2 you with their friends and family anymore. @CAPS2 you don't want to surromb to the computers. put down the mouse and go outside! Obesity in @LOCATION1 is at an all time high. Experts agree, that computers and other types of technology are to blame. People who spend a lot of time on the computer hardly ever exercise and that effects them negatively. These people have a shorter lifespan! They might not be around in twenty years to see their grand children grown up. Also, they have many medical problems. @PERSON1, an obesity expert, says, ""I have seen a positive correlation with the obesity rate and that of @CAPS1."" @CAPS1 can kill you! Obesity can also cause heart attacks and infertility! @CAPS2 you can avoid these diseases and health risks by getting off the computer, why wouldn't you? Using the computer is not a good price to pay for you health! Do you have fond childhood memories that involve nature? I know I do. Most people who spend too much time on the computer don't get the chance to make memories like that. Theyre too preoccupied with the computer to care. Many people won't ever see any of our national parks! Drew @PERSON2, a park ranger, says. ""In the past few years. we have had less visitors than ever before."" @CAPS2 people can't tear themselves away from the computer for even a minute to see the splendor of our national, there is obviously something wrong. Get off you computers and go outside! I share everything with my friends and family and try to spend as much time with them as possible. Almost all people who use the computer often say @PERCENT1 of the time, they use it as an excuse not to see friends and family. In reality, they don't want to leave it. As a society, we are becoming too dependent on technology supervisor says. ""I have seen as definite decline in family enrollment. We hardly ever see kids with friends and family hanging around"". She is right. Now is the time to stop using computers! Computers @MONTH1 not be totally to blame for the problems stated above. Maybe it's the people a though computers do contribute to the problem. @CAPS2 we didn't have computers, there would be more people out exercising, and enjoying nature. Memories would be when we hung around with friends and family. Now is the time to turn of the computer, and go outside. Call up a friend and take a stroll, @CAPS3 you do, know you can have fun withour computers.",10

Computers help so many people with everyday questions. Our country has gotten smarter because of computers. You can converse with friends that have moved across the state, country, or even world. At every click of your mouse there are new things to learn. You can even use the computer for your personal enjoyment. Computers have opened up so many opportunities the world needs to lake. When I was four years old, my best friends at the time moved to florida. I was devastaded. At first, we tried writing letters to each ohter. Then, as we grew older and became busier and busier, or connection with each other halted. As technology and computers have advanced, my friend and I text, e-mail, and instant message each other all the time. It has made our long distance friendship easier and closer. Because of computers, you can communicate with friends you thought were long-lost. You can also meet new people with one of the many sites available. How would you like to talk with someone all the way down in @LOCATION2? World communication has also opened up many business opportunities. Since the economy is failing, computers will open job spaces, help college students study for their futur career, and hopefully help to improve the lives of many people. Communication is needed for many things to make our world better for generations to came. Instead of going to a noisy arcade, why not play exciting games right in the privacy of your. Any game you can think can probably be found on the @CAPS1. From a simple game of solitare to an advanced level of shift, games for any age and difficulty level can be found. New, some people @MONTH1 think that all kids are going to do is sit in front of the computer and play games. There are going to be some peole that will refuse to go outside, spend time with their friends or just read outside. There will definitely be some people like that. I can't help it. What we can do is all those that refuse to go outside to do so. I know many people who spend and budget their time wisely and still have a great time. We can also encourage kids to use exercise programs on their computers and video games to improve their health. There are many fun and games that help you to be a better and healthier person while still having fun. The computers we have in our homes right now are equipped with so much information that if you tried to take it all in are you would be overwhelmed. @ORGANIZATION1, a popular search engine, gives you the power to look up anything you could ever wait to know from the vice president's birthday to the price of eggs in @LOCATION4 to how wide the @LOCATION1 is can all be found with the click of a button. this knowledge helps with homework assignments incredibly. Most reference books are out of date and information is inaccurate, but computers are updated so frequently, you have all the facts all the time. I think our country has gotten much smarter because of computers. So whether you want to talk to your long-lost friend in @LOCATION2 or talk to an expert on osprey in @LOCATION3, you can find your answer on the computer. While you're at it, play a couple exciting games and learn about the best movies ever released in @DATE1. Have fun and learn lots!",11
765,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 I think the effects that computers do on people are really positive. Computers can be used for all sorts of things. Examples like finding things out about history. People that changed the world and other information. Computers give the power for children to learn. For example, their are lots of websites that offer online tutoring or good ways to help you pass school. Other positive way is online dateing sites. You can meet new people and is a good way to make life even better. Popular sites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and so on make a good way to keep in touch with friends from your past, or even make new ones. But the most that I think thats the best in my opinion is going to school online. Once your done with colloge and you are a nuse, for an example you can get a higher degree like a registered nurse then being a @ORGANIZATION2. I think computers has a positive effect on people.",6
766,"Many people use computers. Some people agrees that it benefit the society and others disagree. Some experts think people are spending too much time on the computers, and less time exercising, playing outside, and having family time. I think differently, computers help us with hand-eye coordination for jobs, stay in touch with family members and friends, and computers also help us learn about different things. Computers help us with many things but the most important is jobs. Many jobs use computers. In order to get a job using computers you need hand-eye coordination which computers teach us. Computers prepare is with skills we are going to need when we get jobs. Computers are very helpful. Computers also help us stay in touch with our family members and friends. @PERSON2 @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1 says that if we didn't have computers @CAPS2 wouldn't have been able to see her neice and nephew open their christmas presents @CAPS2 got them. @CAPS2 also wouldn't have seen her nephew take his first steps. ""Technology is wonderful"" @CAPS2 explained to me. @CAPS2 loves staying in touch with her families through computers. Computers are also help young children to old adults learn new things. Computers hold a lot of information, many people learn things they have never heard of on the internet. My younger sister @PERSON1 learned how to read on the computer. @CAPS2 is in the highest reading level you can be in, in first grade. Computers are very helpful at learning new things. Computers can do many things, they help us with getting jobs by teaching us hand-eye coordination. They can also help us keep in touch with our loved ones. Computers teach us about interesting things like faraway places and people. Computers are a wonderful thing to have in our society. Experts, their is no reason whats so ever you should be concerned with more and more people using computers, it's a good thing.",8
767,"What I am going to tell you could change the way you think about computer in general. People might say that computers are great to be on its fast and you get what you need but I think computers are not good they become addicting and make your bills every high, computers can lead to your child sending less time with you and your family, also computers can be very danerous for teens and children of all ages. I say that computers are addicting this is a fact @PERCENT1 of students spend most of there time on the computer. Why are computers so addicting well they have instant message you can talk to people around the world. Now I know it might not sound bad but this can be bad for your pocket @PERSON1 who works with electrion bills says that because children spend more time on the computer the bills in house have grown up almost @PERCENT2 and the harder it is for people to pay there bills. Computers are what they say now a days are one of the main reason children spend less time with there family. This is true in most familys like mine because pof computers me and my sisters spend more time on then computer than with each other this can cause argueing and fughting between familys. Statics show that @NUM1 people would rather spend more time on the computer talking to people or listening to music than spend time with there own children or parents. Is this what you want for your you and your children to be separated by tecongly? Computers aren't always safe for teens and children of all ages. There are many reasons why computers can sometimes not be safe for your children or teens. I say this because sometimes we are worried about are kids safty and when your child is on the computer you have no idea who they are talking to or what they are talking about. Teens are most/likely going to met other people online and there are stalkers, posers, and other people out there that are pretending to be soomeone they are not and your child can be one of those peoples who fall for it and it can lead to meeting someone they might not know and they can be kiddnapped, rapped anyting can happen. Children can be always get hurt by verbal abuse they can be threatened by others and hurt and that can cause emotional damage so be careful and monitor your child. These are just very few things that can happen. These are my reason computers aren't the really benefiting are society.",10
768,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 having everything known to man at your fingertips. @CAPS4 having an endless source of information in your own home. Wouldn’t you want all of this all the time? The question then is, do computers have positive effects on people? I strongly believe computers do benefit society. Firstly, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. The main way is by typing. When you type, you start of looking at the keys but eventually you memorize all the locations of the keys. Also, computer games teach hand-eye coordination. If you weren't looking at the screen, would it be possible to win the game? When computers teach you hand-eye coordination, you can use it for other things too. For example, you definitely need it in sports or more. Specifically, baseball. If you didn't have good hand-eye coordination, you wouldn't be able to catch the ball or be able to hit the ball when you swing. Hand-eye coordination very important. Secondly, computers give people the ability to form about places and people. When people are deciding when to get vacation, they go in the internet. What there is in do. Why would you travel in a place is you back. Many use the internet in research other countries. When the eight grade did reports their information. Eighty seven percent the internet. Finally; some people say computers take away from interaction with family and friends, but computers actually allow you to tell with other family and friends around the world. Wouldn't it be wonderful to with your loved ones in a different state of country? The main way of online communication is @CAPS5-mail or @CAPS6 @CAPS7. These allow you to send someone a message faster and easier. It is much easier in remember someone @CAPS5-mail address than it is a phone settle for just talking, when you can actually see the person? It would be like them being in the room with you. Computers are a great way to talk to someone. Why wait any longer? Computers are a great way to refine your hand-eye coordination skills. You can research Faraway people and places to see what life is like around the globe. Most importantly, you can communicate with family and friends online through @CAPS8, @CAPS5-mail, or @CAPS10. Definitely, computers benefit society. So go and share this information with other people to convince them that computers are positive.",11
769,"Dear Local Newspaper: Computers have become a major part of peoples lives. The effects computers have on people are only negative. Nothinggood comes out of using a computer. This is because computers are time consuming from in other activities, computers are not always working which leads to people getting angry, and using computers is bad for your health. I know you have a difficult decision to make but after reading what I have to say, their will be no doubt that you will agree. Using computers is very time consuming. People don't realize how long they have been using the computer. Once you start using it, your hooked and it's hard to stop. A poll was taken and out of @NUM1 kids, @NUM2 of them said they felt groggy and had headaches, after using a computer for two hours. The way computers make you feel is not enjoyable. But while your using the computer it's entertaining, for example, your on @CAPS1 and your talking to your friend and your laughing at them & enjoying yourself, but it's not the computer that's making you happy, it's the person, you might as well see them in person. There for, computers are time consuming & should not be used. Copmputers are not reliable, they have minds of their own. Many people do always rely on their computer and when it doesn't work it causes the person to get angry or frustated. Computers have a vast impact on people, but they shouldn't have to. Dr. @PERSON2 at @ORGANIZATION1 says that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2's frustration & anger is caused by non-working computers. If the use of computers was lowered anger that people have would lower and would lead to other positive things as well. Furthermore, computers are not realiable and cause people to get angry. My final reason is that, computers cause health issues and cause people to be lazy. The obesity rate is higher than ever and people sitting on the computer all day is not helping. @PERCENT2 of obesity is caused by the use of computers. @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION2 says that @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people who don't use computers are much healthier because instead of using computers they exercise. There for, computers cause health issues. In conclusion, computers effect people because they are time consuming, you can't rely on then and it's bad for your health. There for, computers have negative effects on people. ",8
770,"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are a good thing to have for the following three reasons. First, they help people learn by looking up information on different places. Second, the help people talk to friends and family using @CAPS2. Lastly they help people become less stressed by playing computers games. Learning is important and with computers, you're able to learn faster. Computers help you learn about faraway places like @LOCATION1. It is much easier to learn on the computer than to go to the library and check out a book. If you're working on a project and you needed some last minute information, you could just go to the computer and search you're topic. Learning on a computer is much more convenvent then going to the @CAPS1. Another reason computers are good is because you can talk to friends and family who are far away using something called @CAPS2. @CAPS2 allows someone to talk to another person using the computer. These people could live just down the block or half-way accrose the world. My cousin is living in spain for a semester in college. I've skped with her many times. The cool thing about @CAPS2 is that you can acctually see the person you're talking to on the computer screen. @CAPS2 is a great way to keep in touch with family and friends who are faraway. My last reason is that computers help lower your stress level by playing games. Computer games are alot of fun to play. They have games that range from @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the word, to @CAPS5 @CAPS6 beauty barn. Computer games are a great way to lower your stress because instead of piking your self up with to much work, you'll be calming your selfdown with computer games. They also gave educational games. like, Which country is which. This game teaches you geoagrahy while you have fun. Computers are a great thing to have. They help you learn about faraway places, talk to people who live faraway and play fun computer games. Computers are always going to be used and never put to waste. Theres always something you can do when you go on a computer.",9
771,"Dear local newspaper, I think that the computer is not a bad thing becase of three resons one reson is that we can learn a bought a faraway place. Another reson is they teach hand-eye coordination. The last reson is we can talk to frteinds and meet new people. From the computer we can learn a bought a faraway place if we were doing a report on it or just our of curiosity. We can learn wat kind of plantation grow there for food for example tropical places grow bananas and cocanuts. We can learn wat they eat like in @LOCATION1 they eat many beans a lot of there food have beans even there salads. We can find out there language as well maybe they talk spanish like in @LOCATION2. You can also teach hand-eye coordination becase it involves using your fingers and eyes to see what you are typing. You use ur hands on evry thing while typing wether you are typing or you are using the mouse. But it is not just for learning things it is also for freinds becase of al these sites like myspace, facebook, aim, webchat. The posibilities are endless u can even play games. If you dont know someone on face, book, or myspace thats okay it is a great way to meet new people and new freinds. And another thing if u are having trouble findin freind you can just see if they are online. It is good for getting together somwhere or something. And for those pepole who think it is taking away family time you can always just say okay thats enough and talk to them. So that is it they are good because u can learn of places, hand-eye coordination, and talk to new and old freinds. so they are good",8
772,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, computers are a wonderful tool and they bear many positive impacts on society first, computers have created numerous @CAPS2 forms of communication. Also, they have enable us to create a @CAPS2 age in research. In addition, computers have given us amazing @CAPS2 ways to entertain ourselves computers have a incredibly positive effetct on people. One reason why computers have such a positive effect on humans, is that we have developed many @CAPS2 ways to communicate with people all over the world. First, one fantastic program such as @CAPS5 (instant messaging) has given us the amazing ability to hold a conversation with one or more people any where in the world, and be able to respond within an instant. In a recent survey @PERCENT1 of people said that they prefer instant messaging over any other type of communication beside face to face talking, second, most computers come with webcams built in now, so you can actually see the person you are communicating with. I had friend move recently, and we are able to see what each other are doing and remain friends even though we don't live in the same town, and I'm sure a similar experience has occured to you or someone you know. Finally, the popular program of facebook has changed communication forever. People can now see things go on in your info whereever want. Although some it has a wonderful computers have established incredible ways of communication. A second reason computers positively import people is that they have created a numerous research. One example would be our phenomenon search engine, google. Google to almost everything with help people in finding schools now use computer resources such us @CAPS6 which allow in research to the fact that there is so much availbale on the. In addition, computers have created many opportunities for people to learn more because of the billions of web you in existance studies have shown that @PERCENT2 of people have found a website conataining information relevant to their research that was than a book. Computer are the reason that research has contuined to thrive and @CAPS2 continue to be made. Finally, computers have established amazing @CAPS2 entertainment for people of all ages. First, video websited such as youtube have created a place for people to watch music videos and creative films just to enjoy themselves. If you can't get tickets to a concert you want going online to watch music videos by that person is a much cleaper alternative, second, jaming websites are a less expensive, but if you go online you can play similar games at no charge. Finally websites with appropriate funny stories posted on them are a fantastic way to get the laughter of a comic, without leaving your couch wouldn't you prefer to stay home, rather than going out when it isn't necessary? computers are an incredible way to achieve quick, un expensive entertaiment in todays economy. In conclusion, computers impact proper in many positive ways. they're established now forms of communication, research and entertainment that will forever change society. Therefore, I invite you to join me to demonstrate the icrredible strenght of computers.",12
773,"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a negative impact on society. I say this because it alows kids to be bullied at all hours of the day, it takes away from their exercise, and it gives then less time to study and do school work. Overall, i think that talking is the main use for computer. But, some times it is used in the wrong way, @CAPS1. Experts say that @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 kids have thing to use to talk on line, but the also say that @NUM3 in @NUM4 of thoes kids are bullyed on line. Also every year you hear someone or them, well most of the time it is because of @CAPS1. In fact I heard on the news that half of their kids were bullyed online. And because you can go on at all hours of the day, kids can get bullied at any time. Some child say that kids are happy when they go ho,e because they cant be buuyed but @CAPS3 be bullyed at their safe place, their home. Another bad thing about the computer is that it replace exercise. A text A and @CAPS2 football scout said ""every year their are less less people who play sports because of video game or computers."" @CAPS3 the obesity rate of kids has gone up in america and many agree that the cause computers taking place of exercise. Also people think that you get better hand eye coordination but most leaders agree that you don't because it is not your hand that is moving it is your mouse. Lastly, noe grades are lower then ever for students. Most teachers say that @NUM3 in @NUM6 students get good grades and they say that all @NUM7 that don't spend to much time all the computer. I was waching discovery chanel and it said that @CAPS3 most kids are spending @NUM4 hours on the computer and less than @NUM3 hour on studying or homework. The computer made for storing information and learning. How did we let it go from that to a tool wed for @CAPS1, making lazy kids, and for anti-learning!",8
774,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 there has been a lot of talk about how computers effect society. Some ""experts"" say computers are good for society and some think the opposite computers are bad for society because they make children obese, decrease a person social skills, and even make children less educated. Computers are just plain bad. In recent years studies show that children that use the computer often are less likely and less willing to get active. Dr. @PERSON1 says, ""The more children use computers is the more time they waste @CAPS3 not being active at all."" A study conducted @CAPS3 the @ORGANIZATION1 shows that children that use the computer @NUM1 hours a day are more obese then children who use it one hour or less a day. Computers keep children inside all day. A child on the computer is wasting time not being active. The main reason children become fat on the computer is because it is easier to just go on the computer than to walk and exert energy. Computer are a direct cause to child obesity, and they are a threat to society. Some of you @MONTH1 think a computer can increase social skills, and you are dead wrong! On a computer you can ""talk"" to friends, but it is not like you are actually talking to them. On a computer you can talk in privite and say what ever the heck you want. In public if you say something bad you will get in a lot of trouble. A computer offers no face to face interaction. So when a person who uses a computer often is at a social gathering they are usually very awkward. My cousin spends all of his time on the computer and when I went to his on christmas he never took his eyes off the screen! Computers is destroying the social life millions of people. Did you know that people who use the computer often are usually less smart than kids who don't? ""Experts"" on computers say that computers can be used for infenite nolege. The key word in that fraise is ""can"". just because kids have knoledge at their finger tips doesn't mean the will use it. On many projects and homework assignments I have record kids say ""@CAPS2 I just copied and printed an article on google."" @CAPS3 copying and printing students don't learn anything. Computers are slowly making people less educated. Ever since the invention of the computer people have seen promise for society. Now computers are destroying society @CAPS3 making people fat, socialy weird, and less educated. So how can people still think computers are good?",10
775,"It has come to my attention that there is an argument about whetehe or not computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others. ",10
776,"What compters stop you from doing is your homework in school. But when you do something on the computer your not soposes to do, you get stuck on a website you can't get off your screen. So what I'm trying to say is to don't stay on the computer than just @NUM1 min.",2
777,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a student of the local middle school technology is utilized to the fullest. Computers have helped us write essays more efficiently & complete research assignments. However, personally I feel that this constant usage of computers has a negative impact on people. Firstly, computers hinder interpersonal connections. @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION1 help keep in touch with old college buddies', but no computer can replace face-to-face communication. From hard, cold text, one cannot decipher subtle connotations or wit. Bot, people are beginning to replace seeing one another with @CAPS3 networking. With the technological revolution came games like @ORGANIZATION2. These games are addicting, @CAPS4, our society mocks ""nerds"" for spending too much time playing these trivial games, but it really is a serious issue. For example, in a recent study done by @ORGANIZATION3 students, ""@NUM1 out of @NUM2 teenagers who play computer games do not get the recommended amount of daily exercise."" This is because these games are so absorbing. The amount of time put into gaming. Ultimately consumes all free time. This is dangerous, because a gaming addiction can lead to delusion, @CAPS3 inadequency, obesity. @CAPS2 a people, we are quickly learning that what was once so genius, is actually dangerous. If one was to stare at a backlit screen for hours on and, their eyesight would definitely start to deteriorate. Loss of eyesight is just one of the negative impacts computers have in our health. @CAPS2 aforementioned, obesity is issue. Now, couple this with bad eyesight, @CAPS5 @CAPS6 deficiency & a negative outlook & you've got yourself a issue. All of the deseases brought on by computers can be just by less time on the computer, & exercises. Naturally, @CAPS2 a specie we were not to spend so much time in a fixed position. This static state is a new phenomena that is aquiring major health problems. The over usage of computers practionally, robs us of our time, destroys our health, & hinders our @CAPS3 interactions. This makes computers a negative influence on people & their health.",10
778,"More and more people use computers, they love computers for place that are far or the news. Computers are good for everyone in this world. Know one can live with out computers. There's others dat don't like computer for nothing. I know that there's family or friends that be having computers they write each others like in myspace u could have friend from everywhere or family's. But computers are spending to many times on their computers.",4
779,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you ever wonder who really invented the ice cream cone while standing there licking one? Well why don't you just rip out your blackberry and find out? That is that great thing about technology. You can talk to friends or family get help, and it is there. Whenever you need it. Have you ever had to move so far away from your best friend that you cried so much someone thought it was raining? Well this is not nessesary because you can now have a webcam in your computer and talk as much as possible. Of course, its out the same as being there with the person, but its pretty close. You can talk whenever, wherever, with the great invention of computers. One other way that a computer benifits talking in other people @MONTH1 be you and your friends can chat. If your parents are out and won't let you get out you can still talk to your friends. Lastly if you are older you can use facebook to find friends you have not seen in a long amount at time. Another reason that the computer and technology are great is because you can get information you need it. Schools practicaly live on computers. Not only the students but teachers too. The teachers assign projects that include going on the computers and finding information all about your topic. Also if you just that you have never heard of before you can go and find out about it. It is great to those all you have to @CAPS2 is clik a buttom and every bit of information is at you fingertips. This can coms in handy when you are in a fight with your friend about who is a better @PERSON1. You can just look up who has gotten more home runs and there you go. You've got a winner! Have you ever been at dinner and someone ask if you have the hockey game score and you friends, husband brothers out his phone and then says @NUM1 to @NUM2 about @NUM3 minutes after you asked? Well that must mean they have internet on their phone. Phones such as blackberrys, @CAPS3, and iPhone all have internet built in. This means when they are in the airport waiting for their plane, they can just play a game or watch some television. To me that is a pretty cool invention. Also people in business and industry have phones with internet built in because they can just look something up at anytime. So this is why I think having technology is good in our society. Ecspecially because they can talk to far away friends and whatever. Kind of information you need you can already have it with a touch of a button. Also, you can have it in stuff such as you phone or in another technology related thing.",10
780,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 a place where they are all on computers all day long, everyday. I don’t think computers are a benefit to society because you get less time exercising, less time enjoying nature, and you spend less time with family and friends. Computers are not a benefit to society. To begin, computers are not a benefit to society because it gives you less and less time exercise. And wouldn’t you want to go exercise and lose weight. Other than just sitting around on your new computer and having your brain being wrecked out by it. @PERSON1 said that @PERCENT1 of people that get a new computer spend @NUM1 minutes more than what time they usually spend on it. Next, is that you could be outside enjoying nature. New @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Newspaper said that they are worried that it too many people got a good computer that no body would be outside enjoying what left of nature. Because sooner or later there wont be any trees left in the world and humans would became extinct for eternity. Lastly, is that you wont be spending any time with your family or friends. Like when I got x-box live, I couldn’t get off of it. I was addicted to it. And when my family got our new computer, my older sister couldn’t get off of it. She would spend all day and all night on it. Now, if parents take the computer away from kids they will have more time to exercises more time to enjoy nature, and more time with family and friends. Computers are not good toward society.",8
781,"Dear @CAPS1 newspaper, I have resently read that ther are some people do not agree with computers. They belive that people use them all the time. I dissagre with them. One of my examples of why I disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone. This is a great idea! What if your friend moved a few states over wouldn't you still want to communicate? Well, with high long-distance rates, many cna't afford this and how would you see your friend anymore? Well, if you send her pics, or video chat over the web, you can! Also, its a great idea if you want to send a small mesage like ""see you at @NUM1"", instead of saying it on the phone, and paying more, when its free on the computer. The computer also teachs hand-eye coordiantion that is important to use in the world. You can play games, take quiza and tests, go to school on the internet, even listin to music, that is important for us to express. Also there are sites that allow you to learn how to use a keyboard, and work electronics like a computer! And lastly, the computer gives you the ability to see far away places without even beiong there. This helps you do a project on a place you have never been, plan a family reunion or vacation, or find a place where you can have that fun in the shining sun, many people think that too many people are staying in front of their computer than exercising and being outside. To prevent that, they should just limit themselfs to the amount of computer and electronic time they have per day and then go exercise go to a faraway place. So, the computer teachs hand-eye coordiantion, allows you to talk to others,and allows you to see far away places. Don't you think that is great? Think about it. ",8
782,"The importance of computers in the modern world. Computers now and days are popular thecnology now and days computer are a bigger calculator. The invension of the computers were a very short cauculator. It's like a mother begin in your house. Lot of people have different of computers are more improve more faster and more high quality. The computer are now and days are improving their technology, every day there a billions buying computer across the whole world but that does not mean that there the best quality but the people are fighting for better modern inversions.",4
783,"Dear @CAPS1 man, @CAPS2 would you want people to be on a computer all day doing nothing? How would you feel if no one was out getting excrise, and no one was using the playgrounds, parks and beachs. Everyone will be sitting at home on there nice new fanny computers. When you really do think about how much time people spend doing nothing, just sitting around, @CAPS2 would a computer solve that problem? It really @CAPS4't. This is what I would say to having computers, People spend to much time on computers, excrise is needed, everyday, and it makes your body wear and your eyes strained. When it comes to computers everyone wants to get one, but when we say excrise it seems like peoples mind click off. This happens because people are really starting to spend lots of time on computers. If they work on computers during a long period of the day, @CAPS5 head home to spend more time on the computer, @CAPS5 whats that doing to your body? not helping it. I like computers to and I like spending time on them, when i need to get something done sometime that doesn't happen, because I get and I forget what time it is and that's not fun. Sometime this happens to people they are engaged in there computer, when someone is talking to them and your telling them something you need them to do, and there noding there head like they know what you sayed, but the next time you asked if it got done and it didn't, you know they were listening. Excrise is really important for your body and doens't even have to be to got anything, but don't spend your time wasted on computers. This happens to @NUM1 to @NUM2 or families when they come home from work or school, and jump right on the computers, families are not getting enough excrise or spending time with family because computers get in the way of that. Excrise would help to keep you instead of electronics. Computers are like little robots that control your mind and body, it sucks the life cut of you. It strains your eyes it makes you wrat and you really dont want to do a lot, maybe if people spend less time on computers and more time being more focused on families and nature, they @CAPS4't be weak and tired. I know a lot of people who @CAPS4't want computers to be banned, but I think it would help for a lot of reasons and make families closer and bodys more focused, from my experience computers do help in some ways, but when it comes to real life it helps for really no one. i hope you understand @CAPS2 I say these sort of things, but if you do care about health and activities @CAPS5 you would say that computers are not a lot of help also.",9
784,"The effect people shouldn't be on the computers that much because you need exercising to keep you healthy. You wouldn't be learn anything if you play games on it all day. Your brain will be fousing on the computers than school. You would be a bored kid or adult if you keep doing this. It will be sad if you throw your life away just because of a computers. The effect on people on the computer by not knowing technology is some people think that technology is dumb because you have a brain instead of a computers have information in your brain if you are smart. Some people are poor and never had a computer or never heard technology and country some of them don't even have technology or electrion because they can't afford for a computers. The effect that they don't know technology is they can find location and no cellphone you can call your friend go online and listen to music, play games chat to friend and family. Play games with each other. And watch movies. Another effect is learning about computers and how to use it step one turn it on. Click on intert explorer and search on a website to go on it's kind of hard to use the keyboard and typing it fast. The last effect is talking to people that you don't know form online. Is playing the game with a diffrent player you can chat with that person. Conulison this is all my reason why I agree with the effect of a computer have postive reason for a lot of people. This is why I agree with the effect of the computer.",7
785,"Dear local newspaper, I believe that with too much use of computer it will have bad affects on people. People can get addicted to it so easily. They also use a lot of electricity. And people sit on the computer all day and don't exercise at all. These are all bad affects computers have, but their not all bad, without them life might be a little harder. Playing computer games, and online poker sounds fun right? Wrong! People get addicted to them everyday. Online poker could be dangerous. I remember seeing a show about this guy who was addicted to it. He'd put his credit card information in and sit and play all day. Before he knew it, he was in debt. Once he was addicted it was very hard for him to stop. It's a stupid thing to get into because there is no point to it. You sit and waste money, especially with our economy the way it is. A recent study shows that @PERCENT1 of people who play online poker are addicted within two weeks. Other games are also addicting too. There's a website that called addicting. I guess people don't know the affects of being addicted to a computer has on them and their family. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of electricity in @LOCATION1 goes to computer? Thats almost half of it going to one thing. I don't think it's right that pretty much everything is done on the computer now. In our economic chrisis I don't think enery should be wasted playing computer games. We could use energy for more important things that people any need. If everyone didn't need computers to communicate and everything there wouldn't be a problem. The number of computers sold has gone up @PERCENT3 since @DATE1. I understand emailing, and facebook. But don't get out of hand with it. Isnt being outside on a beautiful day great? Wouldn't you rather enjoy that or excercise rather than sitting glued to a computer? Obesity is a huge problem in @LOCATION1. A lot of people are obese from sitting on the computer and not excercising. I remember when I was younger, everytime I went to my friends house, his dad would be sitting and playing poker and games on the computer. He was very out of shape and lazy. His parents later got a divorce because he turned into a totally different person. Most @CAPS1 are lazy. We don't like to do work if we don't have to. I would define they rather excersise or go outside instead of being on the computer. You live a lot healthier when you're not addicted to the computer. And when you're healthier, you're happier. So in conclusion, if you don't control yourself on the computer it can have bad affects. Computers are easy to get addicted to, use a lot of electricity, and can make people fat and lazy. Do you think playing computer games is worth losing friends and family?",10
786,"Dear local Newspaper editor, More and more people are using computers, but not everyone thinks that is such a good idea. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Other experts disagree. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because they let you learn about anything all over the world, they let you talk online with other people, and teach hand eye coordination. I think that computers are very helpful. Dont you love having the oppritunity to research anything from any part of the world that you want to learn about? I'm sure that everyone who has a computer does. With computers, you can use search engines like, google, yahoo, ask, and so many more. I know that computers help me with research all the time when I do projects or write papers for school. The internet is a great, reliable that you cango to when researching a topic for shcool or even just looking for an answer to a simple question. My next reason is that computers let you talk to other people online. Things like facebook, email, myspace, and web-caming all let you communicate with people anywhere in the world. For example, I have an aunt that lives in @LOCATION1, and on christmas me and my family used my cousins webcam to see her and talk to her when we couldnt be with her on a special holiday. Also, things like facebook and myspace let you put up pictures and chat with friends and family all over the world. My last reason why I think computers have a positve effect on people is that playing on the computer is a good leisure time activity. There are all kinds of fun games you can play, and some even let you compete with other people around the world. For example, internet checkers is a game that lets you compete against someone else. There are so many websites that let you pick games you want to play out of a huge selection. Its obvious that computers have a positive effect on people for research, talking to friends & family and leisure activities. I hope you agree with me!",8
787,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers these days have made positive changes to all of our every day lives. People have made beter connections with family and friends, and even have the ability to make new ones. While social networks are great and all, computers can also make work extremely easy and proffesional-looking. They can also perfect the skill of hand-eye coordination. But with that in mind, is the computer truly a harmful or helpful device? Sometimes we wonder where our long lost friends and relatives have gone and how they are. Well, with the computer and internet access, you can easily contact them through great social networks such as @CAPS1. I hear it all the time from everyone that reunions have been made, and friends have been reunited. And reuniting friends, you can also make new ones with a simple click of a button. Isn't making more friends and reconnecting so easy now? Computers nowadays offer wonderful software from @ORGANIZATION2 that can make making slideshows, projects, and reports far easier. I remember making a @CAPS2 with my best friend back when we were in @NUM1 grade. All we did was take the pictures, upload them to his laptop, and then we added captions to all of the pictures. We did an amazing, professional job on the project and received an A-. Though I understand that in the process of computer-usage, people hardly find time outdoors, the technological advance will enhance hand-eye coordination. Imagine this: You're up at bat in a baseball game. @NUM2 strikes and @NUM3 balls is your count. Everyone is cheering you on. The pitcher pitches the ball and wham! You swing that bat and hit yourself a homerun! Do you know what skill was used to hit that ball? That's right - hand-eye coordination. So now while everyone is wondering what sort of effect the computer has, remember how easy that work was for me. Also think back to that baseball player. You know, the one that hit the homerun using hand-eye coordination. But most importantly remember how easy it would be to contact the ones you love most and keep closest to you. The computer is a positive advance in society, and everyone should be assured so!",10
788,"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on peoples' lives. You can do alot of stuff on the internet that costs too much to do without it. You can study different foods and cultures around the world. If you play games online you can get better hand-eye coordination skills. There are also things you can buy to video chat with family or friends. The computer is very convinient and useful. If you are interested in a place in the world you can type in the name of the place and get facts about cultures, foods, and more. Instead of buying an airline ticket to see @LOCATION1, you can go online to learn @CAPS1 language. You can also study food s that people eat and the clothes they wear. You can also learn sports and games. If you play games on the computer you can get a better hand-eye coordination. Most games you can daunloads and are free. There are puzzle games that challenge you, action that are fun and take rapid button pressing, and adventure that let you explore new lands. And in alot of these games you can talk to people and make friends. There are otherways to talk instead of games. There is email, chat rooms, facebook, twitter, and video chat. With any of these things you can talks to friends or family around the world or in your state/country. All of these you can either download, go on the internet for, or buy them. You can talk to old friends or you can talk to family you havent seen in a while. Video chat you can see eacho ther, face book you can share pictures and chat rooms you can talk with multiple people. In conclusion computers are very convinient for our society today. Whether it's studying the world, having fun, or talking to people you know, the computer has many wonderous things for people",8
789,"@ORGANIZATION1, In @DATE1, more and more of the newest technology is being brought out to the public. Computers, @CAPS1-bars, telephones, and more are getting the most hi-tech softwares and machinery to @CAPS8 some of the most meraculous things happen. There is a cell-phone that allows you to turn of you lights in your house from thousands of miles today. This technology can be the best thing that has ever happend to the world. Some might argue that though. But I am here to argue The @CAPS2-sayers. With the new computers, people are able to talk with people all over the world. Also dreams can some true for people that never have the chance to follow @CAPS3. Also, questions that have been asked can now be answered. I have a number of cousins in @LOCATION3 who I only talk to if I go to visit @CAPS3 which is very rare. Because of some of The programs like @CAPS4, or @CAPS5 @CAPS6, I am able to converse with @CAPS7 cousins. Some people say That The @ORGANIZATION2 can @CAPS8 kids like me want to miss out on some quality-time with @CAPS7 family. Well, @CAPS7 brother is going to @CAPS10 in six months and I am going to want to talk with him. With phone companies haunting their costumers with scary prices, @CAPS7 family is not going to want to sit on The phone with him for @NUM1 hours and have to cut into their savings. On @CAPS7 @ORGANIZATION2, there is an application called i-chat which allows me to talk with @CAPS7 brother and see him as if he were home with me. @CAPS7 dad found out about @CAPS4 and he decided to try it out. As of now, he has reconnected with tons of his high-school Friends @CAPS13 get back in the game. Maybe you can find a special friend that you almost forgot about. Or you can find out what is happening with your sister who lives in @LOCATION1. The @ORGANIZATION2 also allows those less fortunate who can never afford a plane ride to discover a place they've always wanted to go. The internet offers virtual tours of places like the @LOCATION2 of even @LOCATION4- @CAPS14 places can be explored without stepping foot out of your house. Also @CAPS15, a website that offers millions of videos, incudes tourtorials for dances, sports, tricks, and more @CAPS13 you don't have to break into the bank for charged lessons. Another good thing about the @ORGANIZATION2 is it offers mostly reliable information. Sorry didn't get to finish @NUM2 paragraph & conlusion.",9
790,"Computers and the @CAPS1 were a technological break through. It exposed to the average world, things that were never thought possitive. But as these things advanced over the years, they've become an addiction so bad of an addiction its begun to threaten peoples lives I've been given a choice to s'de with the addicting computers, or to offose them. The only clear choice is to offose. First off, computers have caused the world a decrease in exercise. Studies show @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people who use a computer, do not exercise with less exercise throughout the world, nations are becoming more over weight. This is a huge problem in the united states computers are main cause to why the @CAPS2.S is over weight and unhealthy by cutting down computers use, we can get our world back into great shape we can bring exercise and health back. Nextly, I'm sure you've all heard of online predators. It's scary just to think about, well as computer technology increased online predators numbers went up. I remember a couple of years ago, I was watching the news and a story came a normal teenage girl, being killed by someone she meton myspace. things like this still go on, and the rate at which they happen are in creasing. by putting people on computers you're putting then at risk of death this is an extreme problem computers have caused. Thus is the last efferct computers have, out of many that I'm going to state time on the computer, is time taken away from family and friends.This can ruin relationship in and outside the family. Now I'm sure you now many people have become extremely addicted to online games. the more they play these games the more they pull away from everyone they knew and loved computers are a leading cause in disfunctional families. they steal the user away from the outside word. these people need to get their families and friends back. You have to act now, before its too late and computers have over taken the world. If you know anyone who has fallen prey to a computer addiction, do what you can to help get them back we need to cutt back on any kind of computer use fast. Hurry, it's now or never.",10
791,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, computers. The subject of so many debates over the years, from lawyers against judges to parents against children. Could it be to much of a good thing? Are computers the cause of increased awkwardness in today's society. Certainly it can't be to good that your entire life is documented on a place where anyone can go. And then there is the content of what you are viewing. I can't wait to get to that paragraph. One of the top @NUM1 picked-through subjects in the world, are people really less interested in exercise than they were in the @NUM2's? studies show that in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, @NUM3 out of @NUM1 people were overweight. That number has risen to @NUM5 out of @NUM1, as of @DATE1. Amazing! And some of these people might be safer staying inside. If you've played a video game where the player can lose health, you'll know what happens when the bar runs out. You restart. After playing @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @MONTH1 want to try that gravity-defying, head-turning stunt. And let me tell you, there is no restarting after that. Did you know that @ORGANIZATION1 is recording everything you do online? If say, you are a budding guitarist and are looking around for a new gibson, you'll start getting all these ads for online stores, @CAPS12? Because @ORGANIZATION1 sells your info to businesses. And you give them permission by clicking that continue with install button. So spam email comes. But something even worse is on the way. Your bank account number. Thats right, I went there. If a virus get onto your computers, your many could vanish. So be responsible. This brings us to our last subject. The touchy one. It used to be that you had to buy a magazine or book to witness the exploitation of young women. Now, it is just the click of a button away. And that is bad enough. Young boys are snagged early, their futures now controlled by this disease. But add to that the imense risk of a virus attack, and you're in a heap of trouble. So I'm not saying computers are terrible, just that they they could be to much of a good thing. Sometimes they can be a good way to relieve stress, by taking it out on a hapless alien. Just use the technology at your hands responsibly.",11
792,"Dear Local newspaper, I think that computers have a bad effect on people because they will have no time to exercise, less time with friends and family, and it could give a younger child a bad influence. Here are my detailed reasons. The most important reason why computers have a bad effect on people is that the time they spend on the computer they could be exercising to stay healthy. For example my mom runs @NUM1 miles everyday and still has time to go on the computer. If you use the computer @NUM2 its bad, but if you use it in moderation then its a little better. For instance my mom lets me go me go on the computer, but she @CAPS1 makes me go outside and run around @CAPS1 people are always talking about obesity, and computers are one way its happening to kids and adults. They just sit their on the computer and do nothing while on the other hand they could be outside. Here is my second reason. The next most important thing is that kids and adults won't have time to spend time with their families and share memories with them. My mom always tells me the best part of your childhood is making memories with the people you love. My friends and I love to be outside and go to playgrounds and act like little kids, but it makes us laugh and people say that laughing keeps you happy and healthy. Here is my last reason. The last most important reason is it can give a younger chilld the wrong ideas. For example I have @NUM1 younger sisters and they love to go on the computer and some websites are not good for younger kids. One website could be @CAPS2 because bad peole post videos and the little children could see then and get the wrong idea. Here is my conclusion. In conclusion I think computers have a bad effect on people because they spend less time staying healthy, less time and with friends and family and it gives kids the wrong idea. I hope I got my point across that they are bad.",8
793,"Dear to whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I feel computers are bad for society. Computers have been the big difference when comparing @NUM1 to @NUM2 centuries. People have come to rely too heavily on computers. The communication globally has not been very helpful and people are spending hours on their computers every day instead of exercising. On the whole I feel society would be better off without computers. At the end of @DATE1 before the millenea would take place everyone feared what was called @NUM3. The year two thousand would supposedly be when all computers shut down and didn't work. Computers were at their beggining for society so everyone thought they were great. People were panicing over the thought of their precious computers not working. The entire nation had become reliant on computers. Everyone hid in attics and basements waiting for the world to end. Do you know what happened? The sun came out the next day and everyone logged onto their emails with a sigh of relief. Not only relief for the world not ending but for the life of computers to be able to go on. People still rely on computers just as much more today. I recently visited @LOCATION1 and in a rest every where the even had their laptop that they had to take everywhere with them. In conclusion the @CAPS2 society is at a sad state with how much they rely on computers. A fast instinct is to say communication when you why humans need computers. Why is that? We have telephones. Is there nation television channels? We have plenty of means of communication, such as ways like maybe writing a letter to someone? Communication would not be a problem in fact it has mainly caused trouble. Computers and internet allow news to be spread quickly even if it isn't free, damaging someones carrer and publicity. They also allow communication with foreign countries. Exess communication that can get countries into wars. Normally the @LOCATION3 would have no idea whats going on but with internet the nation is involved quickly. Computers breed had communication and you can easily communicate other ways with family and friends. Since I am a teen I also know the problems with youths and computers. Often times kids don't want to go outside and istead sit inside on the computer. Obesity is a rising issue in @LOCATION2 and kids need to exercise. Kids also dislike going on trips like camping outings because they don't want to leave their computer. Without computers kids would get more exercise and be less overweight. Now you have seen @CAPS1 reasoning that society would be in much better if there were no computers.",10
794,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some parents are concerned about their child being on the computer all the time. Now I'm going to talk about @NUM1 good things about computers. @NUM1 bad things, and @NUM1 things on what you should do. One good thing is that you get to talk to people. You could talk to your friends online about something in school or whatever. Thats good because what if you frogot what was homework or you need help on something, you could go online and ask them. Another reason why is that you get to meet @ORGANIZATION1 people. For example @CAPS1 or facebook. When you meet @ORGANIZATION1 people online they mostly come from a different country that you never heard about and then you just learned some thing @ORGANIZATION1 and you have a friend from @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2, or @LOCATION1. One more good thing their is, is that you learn @ORGANIZATION1 things online about anything. It could be a @ORGANIZATION1 website that you never heard about and something that can help you in the future. For example @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 could help you out a lot. Now where going to talk about @NUM1 bad things that computers do. The first bad thing that computers do is that they make you adicted. For example me I got adicted when I had a computer but not I'm not we got rid of ours and now I just play with my sisters. The second bad things is viruses. My grandmothers computer got a virus off of a website that website was @CAPS1. When you get a virus it sucks you cant do anything or you can't look anything up for school. Getting viruses are not cool you have to wait a week or so before they fix it. The last bad thing is that you never want to spend time wit your family. I know some people who do that like its not cool if company comes over get off the computer. Since I dont have much time left I'm going to talk about one thing you should do. You should have a certain amount of time on the computer and go have fun and do what you want to do except go on the computer. Thats what I think you should for now.",8

But if you keep doing nothing ever day your bady will all used to doing fun you can't move or walk. Reason two you can meet dad on the computer becauce people can not tell you all the thing you want to know and they can be doing thing that not ok and they can be want by they can be filters. Reason three you can all in something bad becauce you can be takeing to you and you say something about your self and they are about something hav and you don't know they use you for something you don't know now tell someone can to you and say you all in why but they tell you so being on the computer far a long time can get you in something big. You don't do nothing, you can had really now you can in something bad. Now you know why being on the computer far along time can be bad. Now what will you why you that side.

797,"Dear @CAPS1's at the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 to @PERSON2, ""Computers have helped me further @CAPS6 research. I can search up so many things to help a patient and keep all @CAPS6 important information organized."" @CAPS3 you question a leading doctor? I agree with @PERSON3 and say that computers are good use in society today. People were already becoming lazy because of television. You can't balme it on computers. With websites such as @CAPS4 and @CAPS5, people can keep in touch. They can make plans with one another to go for a walk in the park or dancing. These things can keep people healthy, active and in tiptop shape. Computers help people keep in contact with others. ""@CAPS6 patients can email me to schedule an appointment and let me now if they think something's very wrong with them."" say's @PERSON1. With computers, you can email distant family and friends to learn if there are problems quicker. Most people tend not to pick up the phone if someone calls during a crisis. You also don't have to worry about running up your phone bill. you can just @CAPS4 chat with a bud instead of using up an hours worth of minutes. You can learn so much more information faster. How @CAPS3 feel if no one called and told you your bestfriend died or your mom, and you had to find out by reading the newspaper? You'd be extremely upset. I know I @CAPS3 be with email, you and your family can stay in touch with old, new, and now friends. So if anything bad happens and a person didn't know hoe to tell you, they could email you. It's so much easier than telling a person that their.mom died by email them by phone. To hear pain in a person's voice will make you want to cry. You feel their pain. So, now do you understand that computers are a great benefit to today's society? You can't blame computer's for people becoming lazy, since television was already doing that. If a person want's to be lazy, then that's their decision. you shouln't go around blaming pothers and things when its no one else's fault but that persons. This is a great way to keep in contact with other's. Plus, think of all the information you can learn. Not just about family and friends, but the world too. Thank you for taking the time to read @CAPS6 essay and I hope you can see things @CAPS6 way.",8

Teacher have troble reading other hand writing so it would be helpful for the students to use the computer to print out a very neat paper. The computer has many ways that you can write that paper & now it will be very helpful. The near by libarry will always have extra computers students can use to write a papper. If you walk by a teenager on the internet, now a days you @MONTH1 find them on '@CAPS2'. '@CAPS2' is a website to talk to friends & relatives. Some of these relatives @MONTH1 live very far away or not have a phone to talk on, so you can talk to them here. Some people think '@CAPS2' is 'stupid' & can't be any good, because it takes away time for homework, but what if a @CAPS3 forgot to write down the homework? The @CAPS3 could go on '@CAPS2' & chat with a friend from @ORGANIZATION1 to get that home work. There are many search engines on the computer such as '@CAPS4 pile', '@CAPS5', or even the ever most popular '@ORGANIZATION2'.

799,"Dear @CAPS1, This a letter telling you my opinion about computer. Yes people do spend that time in computers a lot, its because computers are very helpful in many ways. Computers help us with our job, school, work ect. For example science. Im in @NUM1 grade. My teacher @PERSON1 gives us homework; every @DATE1, we have to do @ORGANIZATION1 are @NUM2 facts about anything you want to write about. A lot of people look up bears on @ORGANIZATION2 and they do their assigment about bears. Jobs; secreatenes always have to use computer for everything in our school secreaterys and teachers use computers for attendance, grading. They check you, attendance, grade, phone number and schedule. Communication, my dad the computer wuth our family from @LOCATION1. We talk to know how they've been, to know whats new. Like a week ago I was chating to my cousin she told me her dog had @NUM3 puppies. My family also uses the computer, to order. My uncle went to ticketmaster.com and he ordered two tickets for wwe. He also orders his flight tickets in his computer, to go to @LOCATION1. Well my point is people use computer a lot because they are, very helpful in many ways. Its not good to just be in the computer it good to outside enjoy nature live your life exercise not only to be in shape, but for your health. @CAPS1 hope you enjoy and understand my opinion on computers.

800,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you imagine a world without computers? Well I @CAPS1't because I think computers are great. First of all if you have a computer you @CAPS1 meet new people. Second you @CAPS1 do projects on them or homework if you need to. Lastly in a computer you @CAPS1 basically find out anything you want to know. Read ahead and discover why I think computers are great. Who doesn't like meeting new people, because I do. If you wanted to get new friends or find anyone who go to your school and you might not now you @CAPS1 look them up on your computer. Also if you had nobody to talk to one time you @CAPS1 go on the computer and try to meet new people. I know I do that all the time. Lastly it doesn't hurt anymore to make friends or talk to people online. it's actually fun once you try it. So that's why I think one reason that computers are great is because of the people you meet. Second reason why computers are great is because if you have to print something or make a project a computer @CAPS1 help. My science teacher always wants assignments printed and how @CAPS1 I do that with out a computer. Also if one day you forgot your homwork or any assignments just ask a friend online of if you have a school website look on it. Therefore computers are great because all assignments look ,better when they are printed. My last reason is because on a computer you @CAPS1 pretty much look for anything. For example, say you wanted to find a place to go to and you didn't have a adress or anything, you @CAPS1 always check on the computer. Also if their is a problem or something with you house, car, bills, or anything you @CAPS1 always see if you @CAPS1 get any hekp on internet. Lastly if you wanted to buy anything and you could't find it any stare you @CAPS1 just get it online. So basically like I said you @CAPS1 do anything. In conclusion I think omputers have a great effect on life. First you @CAPS1 meet how people or friends. Second you @CAPS1 do projects or homework. Lastly you @CAPS1 basically do anything on a computer. So that's why I think computers are great and they @CAPS1 help alot in life instead of hurting anyone.",8

802,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing you this letter to inform you that computers do benefit society. Computers benefit society because we can learn about places we want to go. It also benefits society because in a couple years everything will be computers. However, computers benefit society because they @MONTH1 life easier now a days. My opinion is that computers do benefit society. Computers help everyone a lot. First, we can learn about the places we want to go to. We want to learn about the places so we can travel there. However, when we know a lot about that place we might want to but our plane tickets threw the computer site then after you get the plane tickets you can go and discover the places/place. Second, in a couple years everything will be computers. However, @CAPS3 will be threw a computer site (world wide web). We will get our education online. There will be games online. Computers do benefit society. Lastly, computers make life easier. They make life easier because instead of picking up a phone to call your friends or family you can go online to talk, they also make life easier beacuse instead of going to your family or friends house you can go on to aim or what ever chat site you got and chat threw instant messaging. In conclusion, computers do benefit society. First, you can learn about places you want to go to. Second, everything will be threw computers in a couple years. Lastly, computers make life easier.",7
803,"What do you think about computers? I think computers have a very positive effect on people. All kids should have @NUM1. Please heed the following advice. Computers are a very good thing for kids to have. I teaches them life skills such as hand-eye coordination, a lot about technology. Expert @PERSON1 states ""@PERCENT1 of success full jobs involve some kind of inter-ation with computers, & if they learn those skills at an early age they can soon become experts."" Technology is a @CAPS1 part of life today, & will continue increasing with the years. It's a grevious idea to want to separate our kids from technology. As a child, my sister grew up with computers, she knew how to fully use it by age @NUM2, she went to collage with amazing computer skills. Today she works in a law ferm as presidental secretary. She gets paid loads of money. Today she trys to get me to learn about all tech stuff. If you have kids you know you only want the best in their present & future. People say kids are the future, not if theyre not succesfull. Computers are a great way for kids of all ages to learn & communicate with @NUM1 another & others.

805,"Dear local newspaper, I overheard some people talking about how much time their families spend on the computer. My opinion is that they should not be on the computer staring at a screen for long periods of time. I think this because it takes away time from important tasks, there is something healthier than enclosing yourself with a computer monitor, that would be going outside or being active. Another reason is that you can have more time being around family and friends. First, you shouldn't be spending so much time on the computer. You could be getting other tasks done. Such @CAPS2 working, or for most teens, doing homework. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teens get easily distracted by social networking websites such @CAPS2 ""@CAPS1"". ""twitter"", and ""aol"". People in the workplace are distracted two. Sometimes the job can get boring, so workers just go on the computer instead of getting things done. Children could be doing chores or just helping around the house a little, but they go on the computer instead. Teens regular routine consists of waking up, getting ready, soing on the computer, school, coming home, snack, and then going back to the computer. We need to break those habits of going back to the computer. Staring at a computer screen for long periods of time is not healthy. Instead, you could be active in a sport, or just going outside and playing."" @CAPS2 technology goes up seizure rates have also gone up."" @CAPS3 to a doctor at @ORGANIZATION1. Being involved in a sport would be healthier and more fun that talking to people online. Also, your not exercising while on the computer, being active keeps your shape along with being fun. The most important reason you shouldn't be on the computer for a long time is because your using valuable time you could have used to spend with family and friends. Most people barely see their family when their at home because their consumed in the computer. Laptops have made it easier to block people out. Bringing it into your room and shutting the door, is the most common way. Hang out with the friends your already talking to online, wouldn't it be better in person? In conclusion, we should limit our computer time to do other tasks, be active, and spend time with friends and family.",8
806,"Dear, Who ever this concerns Some people are to obssesed with computers. They usually stay up all night playing games or going on @CAPS1.

The last reason computers are important is for the commercial stand point computer help alot of small bussness out by letting than be known. Domestic seller and huge companies can compette for the same customer. Furthermore the internet generates alot money for people becausethey can use it as a cyber billboard.

Computer @MONTH1 be fast and convient, but why of computer our country is one of the most obese countries in the world because of the ""technology"". Computers are bad for humans because they keep people from enjoying nature, keep people from spending quality time with their families, and they give people less time to excersice. First off, people can't enjoy nature. As you know, forest are being chopped down and pollution is destroying our world. People need to see how beautiful our world is if we really want to save it. Second, being on a computer makes you stay inside. People stay inside for at least 6-@NUM2 hours a day depending on your job or if you are in school. Lastly, @CAPS2, computers take away from time that should be spent with friends or family. First people will became anti-social.

Then, without excersice, peoples' bobies will become more prone to diease and injury. Last but not least, people without healthcare won't be able to pay the medical bills and @MONTH1 become homeless.

810,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think that using computers is a good thing and it does not effect on exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Here are three reasons to support my oppinion people learn more on the internet, children at school can go online to find what was for homework, and how the internet does not effect everyday life. My first reason why I think using computers is good because people learn more on the internet, You know what people say, you learn something new everyday. Well, if you are wondering about something or if you're think about something, the internet can help you find what you're looking for, @ORGANIZATION1 is a great site to find what you're looking for. It also has its own images if you need a picture for your project you need. My second main reason to why using the internet is good because if your a @CAPS1, you can go online to check what you have for each subject. If your a @CAPS1 and you don't want to do homework at recessthe next day from being sick. No, you can go online to your schools website and click on your teachers names to see what you have for homework. This way you can still have time to go out side, play with friends, and interact with family members. My third and final reason to why using the internet is good is that it effects everyday life, in a good way. If you don't have a t.v. and you have no idea what the weather is like, you can go online to see if it's going to be snowy, or rainy. This can tell you if you need a jacket or a rain jack, if you need to use a shovel or hold an umbrella. The internet can be useful in everyday life. In conclusion, I think using the internet is very good and will not effect your exercise, or interacting with family. To support this I stated, people learn more on the internet now, children can access homework if you missed a day, and how the internet effects your everyday life in a good way.",8
811,I believe computers are a benefit to society. Computers help hand eye cordination they make it easy to learn about different places and allow people to talk and video chat. Computers teach hand eye cordination when typing and eventually you get so good you dont ever have to look down at the keyboard. you can search for anything on the internet and if you want to learn about a country you can search it and find out all new things you never knew before. Maybe you want to go on vaction to another country and can't decide which country to go to you can go on the computer and look up tourist attractions in those countrys to decide which are you want to go to. If you are on vaction or live in a different place from you and want to see them you can video chat with them over the computer. Those are the reasons why I think that computers are a benifit to our society.,7
812,"Dear local Newspaper, Have you ever wondered why people spend so much time on the computer. The effect of people a computer is good and had because the good parts you can communicate with people in far away places, like you can talk to someone you went to @LOCATION1 with in @LOCATION1 and / or @CAPS1 @LOCATION1 with. The bad part is that if your on the computer all the time then you are neglecting time with family and friends. When you are spending all of you time on the computer you are becoming a couch potatoe and its very unhealty of also a good reason is a family member moved and you had to communicate by webcam so if you like live in @LOCATION2 and you have all you family here in @STATE1 other by sending letter and by sending pictures but they cant see how you act and by phone you can only hear voices you can see anything. A lot people disagree because alot people think computers are a big waste so thats all i have to say on the subject.",6
813,"People the computer is something good and cool. Why is cool? is cool because the computer help you in everything. I have reasons. The first reasons is when in your school you have homework, work, project or something like that the computer help you a lot. Because in the computer you can sign in internet and you go to google or other web side. The second reason is the computer help you in your house for example: You have the big problem with your car or something like that. You can go in the computer in @LOCATION1 and the you see the pieces of your car. The thrid reason for the computer is so cool is because in this time you can make the everything thing. We can go the web and facilitate our life. Now you can realize the work, homework, project, ideas, writting book, chat, information, print picture, and ect... And that you are architect you can make your proper work or house you see the computer is so cool. But some people use the computer for bad thing for example: for pornography or something bad this is not cool and is not appropiate for people. The computer is something fabolous and super genius. My opinion is that the computer help a lot is something like need in our life. No for live but for our life or something @CAPS1. Something you can see your family for webcam. This is fabolous but don't used the webcam for something bad you can learn thing that you don't know. I think that for this reason you used the computer for good thing. Appraise the computer. Please.",8
814,"Dear local newspaper, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own computer. This illustrates that computers must have an positive effect on people if most people own them. I believe computers do have a positive effect on people because it gives you the ability to talk to other people online, learn about new things, and gives you hand eye coordination. My first reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ability to talk to other people online. Some people dont have phones but do have computers. If you needed to contact somebody you could do it using a computer. Also some people have family and friends who live across the world. Computers are great for keeping in touch, it also wont cost you a lot for long distance, like phones would. Because computers give you the ability to talk to friends, family, and other people it is a positive thing because it is important to do so. My second reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ablity to learn about new things. Learning about new things using a computer gives a positive effect on people because you dont have to travel and go places to get information to learn about things. You could do by a click of a button. People could use the computer to learn about anything or everything. Being able to not have to leave your home to gather information about new things gives a positive effect on people because now more people will be able to learn more because they have more time than they would traveling places to get information. This is a positive effect on people because the more you know the better. Having a lot of knowlage is a good thing and will do good things for you in the future. My third reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches people hand and eye coordination. Having hand and eye coordination gives a positive effect on people because your going to need it through out live. If you dont have good hand and eye coordination, it is a bad thing because you use it for just about every thing, such as driving, writing, and excercizing. Computers give you the ablity to learn eye and hand coordontion throughout life which is why it is a posite thing for people. I believe computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the ablity to talk online to people, learn about new things and teaches you hand and eye coordination. I hope this letter persades you to believe that computers do have a positive effect on people.",8
815,"Most adults beileve that computers are just awaist of time and are somtimes can be addicting or bad for health. Well its true it can be bad, but it matters how you use it. There is one thing about the computer that is amazing. That is socilizing with friends, family or even strangers. You know when your parents say never talk to strangers well, you can do this saftely and harmless over the computer, and you also learn alot about life or other peoples life outside your small little town. There is another @CAPS1 perk with computers and that is keeping in touch with family or friends that live far away. My sister went to @LOCATION1 for six months, but the thing was it felt like two weeks because I was able to communicate and se pictures of here @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The last but probably the most important part is getting ahold of. People you actually really need talk to, such as friends, teachers or even people you never talk to in school. With these three advanced ways to soliaze it will always feel like your never alone which an awsome thing. There is many other things the computer is used for other than social life, and that is actuall important use, stuff you need to know or want to find out. Here is one example, everone has forgot there work at school or your office at least once in your life. Well with being able to just grab all the papers off line is easy. Just go to your teachers home page and just print your homework. Its that easy just one click and that saved you a twenty minuet ride to school. How about when your up at night wondering what the weather is going to be lik, many sunny, cold or even a glorious snow day. Well instead of waiting to find out you can just go on weather.com and see everything maps, forecast or what is going to happen hour by hour. Just like weather people always want to know breaking news. Why watch an two hour show when you can just get to the point off whats happening in this world we live in. I mean the parents have to open there eyes and seethis a buetiful thing. We should be proud of the fact that humans have created somthing so complex and intresting. There is one more topic that I know youre going to absoltly love. I mean right now your grading this in your office, well you can be grading this at home on your comfortble couch, with a fire crackling and all the peace and quiet in the worl. People work from home all the time. you can run a business from your very own living room. My father owns company and works from home most days. Its absoutly @CAPS1 be is able to take me out, spend time with the family and most importantly doing the things he loves and guess what, you can do this too. Like I keep saying its only a click away here is another topic, online banking. Do you really want to drive to the bank and sit down with that borring acountant and spend hours there, well, now you don't have to waste your time, you can type in a couple keys and boom, your on your way to see your information. That was faster then two hours i'm guessing. Yes, I believe that computers are a @CAPS1 use of time and will also help alot in the future. So the next time you log on to your comptuer do some of these things and turst me your will think exactly what I think.",11
816,"Newspaper, I feel that the use of computers is no big deal. it is a convienient way to communicate, it teaches young adults and adults social and life skills, and is no different than other addictions. These three reasons are why I feel the @ORGANIZATION1 is under-appreciated. My firsty reason why I feel that the @ORGANIZATION1 is under-appreciated is that some people think that less time is spend with family, but I talk to family, and friends everytime on the @ORGANIZATION1. It is a conveinient, fast, and for the most part safe way of communicating. When I need help with something, I sit at the @ORGANIZATION1 and fb chat someone, or if their not on, I e-mail them. I get my answer within a day. Also you can look up the answer online, the internet is a beautifully smart device. Also if you call someone versus chating on the @ORGANIZATION1 you @MONTH1 have no idea who they are, it is also much easier to trace a call then trace a @ORGANIZATION1 to a certain location. Communication is faster, safer, and more conveinient over the @ORGANIZATION1. My second reason for being @NUM1 is that it can help teach said and life skills. For example, did you know that on average, an adult will make @MONEY1 more if they know how to type good, and fast? The @ORGANIZATION1 serves many functions. Facebook, for example, is a social network, amny young adults can learn basic social skills by having a facebook. Social skills play a very important role when you are finding a job for the first time. If you have good social skills, your boss @MONTH1 like, and apreciate you more. Which can only lead to a promotion! Computers are very nifly to have around! my third, and final reason, for believing, with all respect, that @NUM2 people are blinded, is that people don't easily get addicted to the @ORGANIZATION1. It is very hard to become addicted to the @ORGANIZATION1. Only about @PERCENT3 of facebook users are addicted. Compared to an alcohol addiction, about @PERCENT1, or drug addiction, @PERCENT2, @ORGANIZATION1 addiction is microscopic, and not to mention, not deadly. The only similarity between the @ORGANIZATION1, and other deadlier addictions is that they are addicted, and @MONTH1 become grumpy if asked to stop. ""@ORGANIZATION1 addiction can be cured with a speedy recovery, and as long as you are on for an hour or less a day, there is nothing to worry about"" says @PERSON1, at the @NUM3.) @CAPS1 there you have it, computers use is not a major problem. It is a conveinent communication device, an effective way to learn social, and life skills, and is no huge major source of addiction. @CAPS1 there is nothing to worry about. Sit back and look it up on the internet if you don't believe me.",10
817,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that some people have been concerned about using computers too much. Well, I disagree with this statement. I think the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination. The computer also lets you up a leave more a foriegn people and paces. Lastly, computers helps you communicate with others. As recently stated, I think computers are useful because they help with your hand-eye coordination. For example, when you write papers for school or a document for work, you're using the coordination. You didn't even notice how once hang of typing, you tend to move faster. This machine is a beautiful invention please don't take @CAPS1 away!. The computer is also to everyday life and is very useful for learning new things about far away places and people. Another thing that you dont realizes when using a computer is that the you do from someone in your but from long distance places. How would you get that information without spending a ton on airfare or gas? The computer is the quickest way to find out information! Finally, the computer is an important resource because you can chat with your friends. A @CAPS2 researcher showed that computers You can chat @CAPS3, I think computers has affects on all!

If you go on the computer you can get all of these names and items for less than @MONEY1 compared to %@NUM3. Computers lower the price of things we want and need. I, @CAPS5 a days grandparents try to have a decents conversation with their kids or grandchildren but they go right vack to when they were little. As a grandchild to my @PERSON1 all she used to talk about was her days going through the great deppresion, but with computers she got to catch up on the news and @CAPS5 I can sit down with her and have a great conversation. You can also catch up on the shows you are missing when everyone is talking about them in school. The kids won't be missing out! When I was in @NUM4 grade I got my first facebook, I thought I was so could! That @DATE1 I went to camp and met all these new kids and found out that they all have facebooks. @CAPS5 I keep in touch with them, with out lossing my friendships. You see, I know the scientists or experts are probably smarter than a @NUM1 year old girl but I know that most teenaters and parents have facebook and say its great because we connect with people around the world. So I know these experts are going to make the best dicision on whether or not computers benefit our society but please take my ideas into consideration.",9
819,"Computers are over used and controll the minds some people. Computers are parcally to @CAPS1 for americas high obesity percentage. Americas teens are not doing homework. And noteveteing time into school because of computers. These high tech machines should be outlowed and given to only those who truly need them. People spend way to much time on computers. The time people spend on the computer is time they should be exersizing. Computers make people obees studys show that @PERCENT1 of obees americans admit to being adicted to the computer. This is why computers are bad. The internet on computers is unsafe. Expers say that popular chating sites such as myspace are the reason for the sudden incroas in murders, and rapings. The number of convicted criminals as well as sex affenders i tramendus. Yet parents lot the children on them. People don't understand the troubles computers cause. Besides the other factors computers retard teens learning. Teh comkputer is suposed to be a helpful tool and used for leanring. But computers are being used for other things. Computers encourage kids not to study or do homework. Although those are useful becoming sites and tools, these tool arent used often. Computers hurt people in many ways. America should have off computer week to fight back from its evil grie on children. I hope one day we can all turn off out computers for good.",8
820,"Dear Local newpaper editor, I think computers benefits us in a good way. Weither computers are helping kids with research for homework, projects and essays or building online stocks to help make buisness grow. Computers are now a benificial way of life. We can see what happens on the other side of the world. And learn about new things everyday. What I think people are focusing is what they thikn computers are doing to people, but are really not focusing on how it helps us in so many ways. One way that people say computers effects people is that we don't exercise instead were attached to our computers. I doubt computers do this not everyone likes or wants to exercise. And why would computers stop people from doing that. It's people choice, the computer doesn't forces them to stay in the house. And computers are a great way for you to catch up with friends and family. It could be online chatting and even sharing photos. And I highly doubt people stop seeing their fmailies because of computers it just doesn't make any sense. People who are against computer are giving people in chairs or controlling them, it's just silly. If people acually stopped to take the time and think; theirs a chance that they would see how computers has helped us grow as a nation. And how much they used computers and that it really helped them than just searching through books for a ton of information. As years have gone by I could see that a ton of thinhs are runed by computers and that alot of people use them. And it has impacted our country, in my opinion a good way. And if it wasn't for computers who knows how are nation would be running. And if computers amde such a posotive impact on our country already I can only iamgine the years to come as computers become bigger and better. So as you have read I gave mt reason as how think computers impact our lives. And how I think the years to come it will impact our lives bigger and better. Now I can't force you to be for, or against computers bbut what ever your opinion is just think of a world without computers especially if you grew up with them.",8
821,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I'm writing you today so you can see why advanced technology is a positive effect on people. My reasons for wrint this is because computers allow people to talk online to others people learn about faraway places, and finally it teacher hand-eye coordination. As you read my letter I hope you fell the same way. First of all computers allow you to talk to other people online. The reason I feel this way is what if you can't fond your fone in your hose or even your cell phone, you could see if they were online. Also its the same thing as texting, but with a bigger keyboard/screen I can relate to this because I was texting someone and went online to find whtm on too, so we sent aims to each other instead. I hope you can see why computers can be good for people. Secondly not a lot of people will go to the library to look up information for a paper for a school. The reason I feel this way is a computer has google to make finding things easier. Another reason is going to the library @MONTH1 cause you send more money to fill up your gas tanks. I can relate this because everytim my family goes to the library we have to fill the car up after we go. This is another reasons why computers a good. Finally the computers can teach hand-eye coordination. The reason for this is because if your writing an email then you should know the keys that your fingers touch. Another reasons why computers are hand-eye coordination is because if your kid take karayta then might have learned to move there hands that fast from somewhere. I can relate ti this because when I was in the first grade there was a guy that you told me and my friends that be need us to get in the truck to help him find his lost puppy, and he tried grabbing me but I pulled my hard away before I became pinned. I hope you can see why we need computers. I would like to that the I for sitting and reading my essay. Once again my reasons for writing where people can talk to other people online, learn about faraway places, and finally hand-eye coordination. I hpoe you will rethink why we should have computers in school.",8
822,Many computers that people have they use it everday right? Most of them be on it from the time they get off of work or out of school until it's time for them to go to bed. What I think they should to is find some other activity to do instead of sitting on the computer for six hours and not doing nothing with their life and plus at that when you look at a computer for so long you can mess up you eye sight. Why be on the computer all day when you can go outside and get some fresh aire? Why would you wanna be on the computer when you have family and some friends you could be spending time with and taken care of? You don't want to be lazy and not do nothing for yourself. You wanna be able to go for a walk instead of being cooped up in the house on the computer. Why would you even wanna be on the computer when you could have fun going out to eat or to an place you always have wanted to go your whole entire life? You can't always depend on a computer when you wanna go out and explore something new you have to try it out yourself to really see whats the whole thing about. You don't want to have a boring life now do you? Cause that's what it seems like by you sitting around on the computer everyday looking of a bunch of @NUM1-since you wanna do what you want to do and have fun by doing what you like to do. It's not easy finding a job or planing to go out far away by looking on the computer because you have to click a lot of numbers or pictures to go threw what you wanna get to when you can go and do it yourself by looking for better and other things to do.,6
823,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I have learned that some experts say that people spend too much time on computers when they could be excercising or with friends and family. I, on the other hand, think otherwise. Computers are a great way to learn and communicate with others, here's why: @CAPS3 of all, I would like to say how much computers help us in school. Most students use them every day. We can study for tests by looking for websites with lots of information and we can also research topics that we don't understand. For example, if you want to find out how planets form, you can just type it into a search engine and a list of websites will pop up. Another way we use computers in school is when we have to make projects. We can use different tools to set up a slide show while also looking up information on the internet. Lastly, the internet is also a way for teachers to communicate with their students. If the teacher sets up a blog, students can always see what the class is doing, what the homework is, and find cool links that will help them understand certain topics better. Another point I would like to mention is that the experts say that computers deprive us of time with family and friends when the truth is, its the opposite, computers actually take communication to a whole new level. For example, if you wanted to have a chat with an old friend, you could log right on to msn or aim and find out what's new in their lives. A second way to communicate with friend is by @ORGANIZATION1, a cheap and easy way to contact friends outside the country. Next, you could go a bit more old fashioned and just write an e-mail. It will take longer to get a reply but its still worth the wait in the end. Lastly for parents who kids live far away, video chat is also a good way to communicate because you will be able to see them and hear their voice as well. Lastly, I would like to tell you about just how much we can learn by using a computer. You could just go to a search engine and search any topic in the world and you're bound to finds hundreds of results. It doesn't matter what your interests are because you'll always find great information. The internet also allows you to catch up on recent news such as weather. Next, there are websites that allows you to ask questions and get answers just as fast. You might have to check your sources to make sure they're reliable, but I believe it's still worth it. Lastly, if you are getting ready to go on a trip, you can check flight information with the click of a button. Or maybe you need to find out what the weather will be like, there are many websites for that. There are also websites that can help you learn about the place you'll be staying at as well. Next time, think twice about what you hear about computers because they really aren't all that bad for you. Sometimes it @MONTH1 be better to go outside and play but computers do help you learn and communicate with others which are just as important.",9
824,"Dear officials at the @ORGANIZATION1, have you ever been so bored that you spent the whole day on the computer talking to friends and relatives? Some experts are saying that computers are having a negative effect on people in our society. While others argue that they are very helpful. the use of computers has been taken to an extreme level, and is having a negative effect on the community. Some reasons I feel this way are because of the social limit computors are putting on people and the amount of time people spend on them. My last reason is that computers are the general health of people today. People should be educated on the negative effects computers bring! Firstly, computers are greatly changing the way people communicate. Instead of talking to people communicate. Instead of talking to people face-to-face, teenagers and adults find themselves '@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" their friends and colleges. This is causing many bad-habit forming. People are it more to talk to physically, and might even be using terms like ""@CAPS3"" and ""@CAPS4"" instead of works. This problem is causing a huge gap in the social-wonangs of humans, and is harming them more know! Secondly, the amount of time wasted on the computer is unbelieveable! If someone logged onto the computer to search a fact or ""@CAPS5"" something, they might get caught up in other programs and spend hours on the computor. This time could have been used for more productive things instead. A recent polls shows that that average person from ages @NUM1 spreads over two hours on the computer each day! This fact is quite amazing, because these people could have been getting more things accomplished in this time. The amount of time wastedon computers is a huge problem that needs to change! Lastly, humans' health is being affected drastically by the use or computers. As the obesity rate is rising, these people are just sitting on their computors watching it go up. During this time, they could be exercising, going to the gym, or even taking a walk with friends. Teenagers could be playing outdoors, but find themselves too busy on their computors to enjoy the fresh air. Whenever I talk to my friends, they usually say they are on facebook or oovoo instead of outside or playing with their siblings. The obesity rate will keep rising if these people don't realize that staying on computers all day long is a part of the problem! In conclusion, the use of computers has gotten to a point where it is hurting society, rather than it I feel this way because of the social-flow it is teaching people, and the amount of time wasted on computers. Another major reason is because of the extreme health issues computers are. If the average person tried! to limit the time they use their computers, they would notice a positive in their life-style!",11
825,"Imagine a world without computers chaos in war, even the cluter on your desk. The chat you're having with you bestfriend on aim wouldn't happening. The report on @LOCATION1 might not get done because all the books were checked out, in fact we wouldn't have noble or any space program without computers. I know of this happened I wouldn't be happy. Compaines almost relys on technology you can't just send a letter and have @CAPS2 at the office in five minutes. Communication through the computer is very popular. @PERCENT1 of the world use aim or another chat service, in a studie done by a @CAPS1 professor @NUM1 out of every student doesn't talk to family on aim service a quote from the professor said ""@CAPS2 a good thing to stay in touch with their familys as wel as keeping up to date on curent events. @CAPS5 computers are taken away information is gone.

826,"Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1 you think computers are great for everyone? I think computers are one of the greatest inventions ever. What's really great about them is how much you can learn from computers. You can learn hand-eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk online to people. Surely, read on to see why computers are very important to us all. Many people think that computers are bad for our mind, but actually they're not. When on computers you can learn hand-eye coordination. You can be able to type well and very fast after a while and improve your eye sight by reading your writing or notes for a paper. Lastly, you can even have fun, relax, and type out your papers for reports. Definitely, read on to see what computers can @CAPS1 too. They're a lot of faraway places that have their own specil way of showing you a great time. On the internet, that have a list of vacation spots or places that grab your attention to visit. They give you details on why to visit it and a fair price. Think about it, would it be cool to visit a great place, like @LOCATION1. Without a doubt, continue reading. Have you ever wanted to play outside but it was raining or your friends were not around. Well, on the computer you can talk online to your friends. You can see how their doing or what their doing and still have a good time. Not to mention, you can even make new friends. Lots of kids and teens go online to make new friends. Surely, you should agree that computers are great. I think computers are very unique and important. That's why so many kids to adults use it the computers so much. They use it to learn hand-eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk online to other. Thank you for reading my paper local newspaper.",8
827,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 technology was grown exponetially during the last few years. The use of computers especially has sky-rocketed. However, I beleive this is not somthing to be excited about. The use of computers all the time can effect people's health, family and friends, and their apprciation of Nature. The ove useage of computers is a huge problem. Have you ever sat infront of a computer screen for hours on end? If so, you know the feeling of sleepiness and irritability. The lack of exercise while using a computer impacts people more than they realize. Excessive use of ocmputers has been linked to obesity and high blood pressure. the more people use the computer, the higher their blood pressure. Just sitting infront of a screen is terrible for people's bodies. To stay healty, only use the computer when it's absolutely neccesary. Going on all the time can seperate you from others. This g eneration, adolecents especailly, use the computer to comunicate with others more than actually talking to them. Communicateing only over the computer can draw them away from people socially. Not ot mention how fast rumors and secrets spread over the internet. Useing the computer can ruin relationships even those with family. Being neglegent of family by always being on the computer can draw people apart. Families can became a non-important thing. People can't pay atttention to their families while sucked into a computer screen. Computers are creating false substitutes for almost everthing, even nature. Humans started out living i nthe wild, gathering food from the land and giving back by raplanting. Our connection with nature was strong. We needed it to thrive. Nowadays, however, instead of listening to the sound of rain and the crinkling of dry leaves, people prefer high pitched artificial beeping and the classic ""You've got mail."" People do not appreciated nature as they used to, as they should. The beauty of nature is simply overlooked as if it's nothing special. Well, without it we wouldn't be alive. Life cannot exist with nothing to thrive off of. We can hop on our computers and look at pictures of nature on @ORGANIZATION1. com, or we can grab our shoes and see it for ourselves. No one can experience the greatness of nature while on the computer. No one can experience the feel of cool lake water sliding over their skin or a hot @DATE1 day while emailing a friend. It can't be done. Computers have robbed us of our ability to experience creature. In conclusion, computers are horrid for people. They can affect health, friends and family, and appreciation of nature. We must use computers only when neccesary in order to stay healthy. Instead of going online, get going outside.",10
828,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, some people do spend most of the day on the computers, but not everyone. Oh, let me start with no. Not all people take atvantege of the computer. Like scientest, your banks, and schools. These tipe of computers helps us through life. With out these computers then we willl still be cluless on a lot of things. But, there are people out there that did take atvantege of the computers. And they still do. With unforgiving acks like child porn. One of our mane problem in the world is child porn. And a lot has to do with the kidnapping. Or in rare cases the parents are the cause of it. So these are a lot of changes that need to be doen. But when there cleared then the computer world will be peacful once agaen.",6
829,I believe that people spending to much time on computers can effect their health and the relationship they have with friends and family. If you are on the computer and one of your friends ask you to go outside you are most likely to say no because the computer is grabing your attention more than going outside. That hurts your health and your relationship with your friend. If your family is going to a movie to have family time maybe you will stay because you would stay home on the computer. That effects the relationship with your family. Most people rather stay on the computer than spend time working out. So that effects your health because most of the time your on the computer for a long time your going to end up hungry and keep eating and eating and since your not working out you get fat. Now your not working out and you just keep eating. So since you are not working out and your mind is always on the computer you can get sick. Thats why most people are not healthy because of computers. Computers can mess up your relationships with family and friends. Sometimes your friend can ask you to go outside or to work out and you say no because your on the computer that messes up your relationship with your friend. Or your family can be having a movie night and your on the computer while they leave. That is messing up the relationship with your family. Being on the computer you can go nights without sleeping. I your playing a realy good game on the computer and it comes time for you to take a rest and since the game is so fun you don't sleep. Then after a while you get addicted and won't stop playing. So you won't get sleep and if you have school you won't be able to concentrate you will to busy worried about the game. So thats why computer aren't so good. It can mess up your health. I can mess up your social life with family and friends. You won't get a lot of sleep and won't be able to concentrate.,8
830,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 name us @PERSON1 from @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. I thought it would benefit your opinion on the effects @ORGANIZATION1 computer usage throughout the @LOCATION1 if you heard from a young teen. This would help you because at @CAPS1 age people are dependent on computers! they can be entertained by online games, communicate with friends and family and receive news about what is happening around the world. Although some people do not always benefit by having a computer, most @ORGANIZATION1 the time people are satisfied, and do benefit from the use @ORGANIZATION1 computers. First off, people are affected by computers in a positive way because they can be entertained whether it is playing online games, or participating in a fantasy sports league. Although I just mentioned two non-educational examples, there are many educatiional websites on the internet which children can learn from. In @CAPS1 personal life I can name so many examples @ORGANIZATION1 entetainment. I use such as @CAPS2, which is an online game website, or fantasy football teams I am involved in. Another example @ORGANIZATION1 entertainment is when @CAPS1 younger brother. Parker goes on leaving websites. He will play on these websites for hours. Although he is sloveling infront @ORGANIZATION1 a computer screen he is learning. Also, expert say that children in the throughout the world learn more from the computer then from a textbook, or hearing information from a teacher. They say this because a computer screen catches peoples attention. Learning is a major priority and if it means putting a child infront @ORGANIZATION1 a computer for an hour will improve this, then that is what will happen. @CAPS1 next reason why effect @ORGANIZATION1 computers on people is positive, is because it helps people communicated with friends or family. @CAPS1 brother is attending college at @ORGANIZATION1 and since we do not see him often. our family will video chat with him over a program called @ORGANIZATION4. Because @ORGANIZATION1 this program we are able to stay in touch. An online poll was put out on @DATE1 which asked how people regularly talk to friends, or family. Sixty-three percent @ORGANIZATION1 the votes showed that people communicate over the computer most @ORGANIZATION1 the time. Thirty-two percent said over the phone and about sixteen percent said in person. this shows how much people communicate over the computer using, facebook, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and much more. I would say that the computer is a good effect ion people when used this way. Lastly, computers help people receive news about what is happening around the world. On the computer at @CAPS1 house, everytime I open the internet there is breaking news about the war in @LOCATION6 devistation on @LOCATION5, and much more. Alsom a few months ago a class at @ORGANIZATION3 made a pie-chart and discovered how their classmates find out world news. Fifty-six percent said they foud out their news from computers. Not only is it @ORGANIZATION3 students but most people get news from the internet. Just the other night at dinner our waiter was from @LOCATION4 and he said he received all @ORGANIZATION1 his news about his hometown from the internet. As you can see many people use the internet on their computers to receive news and information. It is easy to tell that the effect computers have on people is positive because @ORGANIZATION1 the reasons I have stated above; people can be entertained, they can communicate with family and friends, and @MONTH1 recieve news about what's happening around the world. Like I said on the first paragraph, not all the effects are positive but most @ORGANIZATION1 them are!",12
831,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people? In my opinion, I would say that computers have negative effects on us. This is because we would get less exercise, less time to enjoy nature, and interacting with family and friends. If your on the computer most of the time at home, how would you get your exercise? You wouldnt because the whole time you would be stuck sitting down at the desktop. This is also a proble because this is how obeseity can occur from no exercies, and just sitting all day. Or people who have heart problems nad need exercise can worsen by being distracted by the computer. Being home on the computer does not let you enjoy nature. Instead of going outside in the warm wheather, having fun people are staying home. This is not good because they should be out having fun, not on the computer all day. Missing time with family and frinds is unexeptable when your on the computer. This is because yar supposed to keep your family and friends company and not daze off on what your doing on the computer. Also you miss family gatherings or leave yar friends lonley. Thats because yar to busy on the camourar nad not paying attention to anyone arand you. This is why I think computers have a negative effect on people. This is because of less exercise, less time to enjoy nature, and interacting with family and friends.",8
832,"Dear newspaper editor, I have recently heard that some people think that computers have a negative effect on people. Well i think that computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it helps make learning about other countries easier. Also, it helps people talk to people from different countries. Another reason is that it helps people learn about different cultures, religions, or traditions. The reason why some peope think that computers have a negative effect on people is because people are spending more time on the computer than spending time with their family. Also, people use the computer more than they use exercise machines, bicycles, or scooters. Now that you know about the positive and negative effects of computers, Which side will you choose? the one against computers or the one for computers. I would choose the one for computers.",6
833,"Dear editor, Have you ever stopped and asked yourself which was more important? Of course I can be talking about anything, but what about computers verses family, friends, nature, your own health etc. Well, I ask myself that quite often, and I feel that it's so much more worth it to be with family and friends than to be infront of a computer. There is so much more that I can tell you, and just after my very first reason how could there even be another side to it? Why is it that now these days kids can't simply run out to the bus stop without feeling totally winded? I feel it's because they are not getting enough well needed exercise! For example, instead of sitting infront of the computer, kids, and even adults can enjoy going to the gym. Also, children can get more involved with school sports so they can not only be participating in sports, but they can be involed with school too! Lastly, just by going for a short walk with your dog, your not only walking and getting well needed exercise, your bonding with your loyal friend. Have you ever been gazing out the car window when you just found yourself being sucked into all the beauty that nature has to offer? Well, if you have I guess you could never have too much, but if you haven't, its probably because your spending way too much time on the computer! There are so many different ways that people could learn to appreshiate nature more, such as sitting on a park bench in the @TIME1, while absorbing the fresh air and sunlight. Or you could go for a slow, realaxing bike ride through a trail with a constant cool breeze, brushing your face with every of your wheels. Finally, you could pick a warm day to sit out on the beach, and listen to some music, next to the salty ocean. How could you resist those temptations? Lastly, I believe that family is the most important thing to missing out on! Without family and friends you miss out on so many good ethics and experiences. You lose out on having good lifetime realationships, and how could you turn dow the offer to be with the people you love? In conclusion, I feel that computer are taking away most of the things that no one deserves to live without. I mean, how could anyone live without family, friends, the beauty of nature, and your own health? That is why everyone should make the right desition to take reasponcible charge of their life, and the same question, which is more important?",10
834,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1... scroll... @CAPS1. ""@CAPS2 you know that only the male coqui is the only coqui that sings?"" Some facts are easily found on the interneat? The computers make researching easier just imagine not having to drag home those gigantic books home or having to constantly find information in them. First, the computer teach as hand-eye coordination. Second, we can learn about faraway places. Finally, we can make friends from all over the world. When, the ball goes right out of the parts! the plastic object with a screen(computers) teach us hand-eye coordination. It teachs us this by making our eyes stay on the screen, twhile our hand are on the hard, smooth keyboard. Children need hand-eye coordination for ball-playing sports like baseball, basketball, soccer and more. When your in high school and play sports well, you @MONTH1 get scholar-ships to go to college. College is important because it has a big role in our life so we @MONTH1 earn great jobs. Learning about faraway place like @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 and so on is very intersting. Unless, your learning about it throught looks, which are dull and borring. The interneat has taken over our and it is resentlessly and without hesitation. The internet takes less time than going to the libary and getting back. Also, skimming throught paragraph after paragraph on the computer is much simple.",7
835,"Dear local newspaper, Computers are they a good benifit for society or a bad benifit for society? What do you think would you enjoy always being on the computer? I wouldn't, so this is why I believe that computers have a negative impact on society. First reason why I think computers have a negative impact is because you can become addicted to always having to be on the computer. Becoming addicted to the computer leads to serious consequences. For example you spend less time exercising and that isn't healthy for your body physically. Not exercising leads to many things like being over weight, health problems, diseases like dieabeties, and many other things, but usually these are the main problems. You can aviode this by turning of the computer and just go for a small walk, but because of what computers have to offer now these day people want do this. Thats one reason why computers have a negative impact on the society. Another reason for why computers have a negative impact on society is because you won't spend as much time with your friends and family. Even if you don't know this if you spend more time on the computer than with your family and friends this affects them in many ways. They can feel dissapointed worried about you, even concerned. When you are always on the computer you're ignoring your family and this hurts them emotionally. Think about how would you feel if you had a best friend you always hung out with. You two did everthing together, and the all of a sudden your best friend suddenly stops calling you; or visiting you and hanging out with you. You would feel dissapointed because you loss your best friend over a computer. These things can happen if you go overboard when using the computer. This is why is think computers don't do good they do more harm in my personal opinion. The final reason why I say that computers aren't way good is for a main reason safty. Those days computers have all the websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, twitter, and others. There are so many kids who chat with people they don't even know. Also they're posting pictures of themselves without even thinking that this is a dangerous thing to do. Once you post those pictures they will always be there no matter if you even try to delete them. Another thing when you're on the computer people don't even think about their safty and thats how things happen. For example you can think you're talking to a friend but as it turns out you were talking to some stranger. Then you go meet up with your friend when it really wasn't. So you see safty is a real big problem with these computers. That's why I believe computers have a really negative impact on society. As a result, do you still believe that computers are a good beifit for society or bad beifit? My opinion stillis the same and I'm sure that there are others who believe the same. So this is why I think that computers are a bad benifit for society, and that computers can lead to more harm than do any good for people who use the computer.",10
836,"Dear editor, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 and I am a @NUM1 year old girl; yet active in reading the daily newspaper. As I was going through last weeks newspapers, I saw an ad to write an article about either the negative or positive factors about computers. I am here to persuade other readers about the negative affects computers have on people. As an active member of the computer, I take part in all negative factors. People who spend more than one hour on the computer are involved in @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or playing a computer game. of those kids are too involved in their compute games. I saw this segment on @CAPS5 @NUM2 about how @PERCENT1 of all teens play on the computer atleast once when they are supposed to be homework. Computer games distract from kids learning. Kids feel that @CAPS3 is more inportant than doing math homework. Computers don't benefit to kids learning. Kids or even adults who are too involved in some use of computers don't want to talk. They feel they need to focus on winning and beating all their friends. To win, people can't talk, just focus on the game. Kids who need to win and not talk could lead to lifetime results. Being self-consious or having no social skills are the biggest lifetime results from being too involved in a computer game. That is how being too involved in computer games affects their social skills. Kids who are too involved in their computer games, don't get enough exrcersize causing obsity. Kids think they are getting exrcersize by playing but in reality they are doing nothing at all. Kids think they can't leave their game, but they can. there is always a pause button somewhere on the screen. Soon kids get addicted to playing and dont think going outside is important anymore. That is how computer games cause long term effects. In conclusion, computers have no benefits on people. Computers cause no learning to be done anti-socialism, and abesity. All of these results are long term which causes you life to be okay. I dont you want a happy and successful life?! I know I do!",9
837,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 people are talking about computers and what it does to us. People believe that using the computer is a waste of time. I believe that computers aren't a bad thing. Using the computers can help us learn about other places in the world. It can also show us the lives about people from the past. We can also talk to our friends online. If you want to know why computers are useful, just keep on reading. People say that computers waste our lives. I disagree with that opinion. The internet is a great way to learn about different places in the world. We can learn about the climate. The animals, and the food they eat. @CAPS1 palces have different types of culture. For example, in @LOCATION3 everyone eats seafood. In @LOCATION2, everyone eats spicy food. The internet can show us pictures of beautiful places that we have never seen before. It's a great way to see and learn about different places compared to how you live. Do you have a friend that you haven't seen in a long time? Would you like to be in contact with that person again? Well the internet is a great way to do this. It allows you to make an account such as twitter, facebook, @NUM1 and more. You can search up your friends name and magic! You finally have the chance to talk to your old pal again. You would be thrilled to be able to talk with them again. @CAPS1 kids use the computer in order to do their history projects. Well the internet is here to help. You can search up famous people from the past or people from now adays. The internet allows you to see and learn about these people's past. One example is @LOCATION1. He was the first president of the @ORGANIZATION1. You can learn so much about him like where he was born, how @CAPS1 family relatives did he have and more. So you see, the internet is a great use for kids. These are my reasons in why I believe that computers aren't bad. We still have time for family, friends and any fun outdoor activity. We can learn about different places in the world. We can talk to friends online, and we can learn about people from the past.",9
838,"If you ask me, computers are going to soon be a big problem in our lifestyles. Computers are just another material thing everyone has and seems to be benifiting from, but they aren'@CAPS1. This technology is taking away peoples freedom and will and they don'@CAPS1 even notice it. It is pretty clear to me things need to change. To begin, the computer is yet another distraction to our daily lives. I think that it is safe to admit that we don'@CAPS1 need this. Distractions like these keep us from doing the things we need to do, such as excersise. Every wants to get their extra weight off, but they can'@CAPS1 because the want to check website or talk to their friends. So its pretty much a lazy distraction. Would you really want to give up your health beacause of something so materialistic? If we keep clicking, more then @PERCENT1 of the population that are fit and healthy will become obease. I think we need to reform this problem soon. Like not promoting websites on so many @CAPS1.V networks, or have a computer shutdown week, anything that will get people to be outside enjoying life as they should. To continue, have you ever found yourself asking your kids on how to work the computer? Dont you see how sad that is? Our future leaders are already glued to the games, email and instant messaging of the net. Its plain to see they are already spending too much of their time online. This is concerning fact because more and more kids each year turn in less and less in school work because they  have better things to do such as chat with their friends or watch funny video online. Its a scary though because these children are our future leaders. This is a critical point in their lifes. They need to learn about things now so their futures arent hanging by a thread. Instead of making a habit of going online everyday why not make a habit like try to get all your homework done each night? Things in childrens lifes need to change before they pay for it later in life. To sum it up, many things about our lifestyles need to change. Wether it be in schoool work or losing weight. So I think it would be best if we took out, or lessend our computer usage to lower the distraction and more on in life without revolving our world aroud a click.",8
839,"Dear local newspaper, The effects Computers have on people is that people realie on them and thats not good because they have less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. First of all, having less time exercising is not good because @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people ent up fighting obesscicley. ""You don't want to be one of those people trust me"" said @PERSON1. Second, enjoying nature is a good thing to do instead of playing with a computer because you get your daily dose of air by enjoying nature. ""You also have a lot of fun"" said @LOCATION1. Lastly, interacting with family and friends is fun and who doesn't love that. ""Spending time with the family is fun cause you get to go places,"" said @PERSON3. ""Who doesn't love going out and spending time with friends on the weekends,"" said @PERSON2. Those are my reasons why the effects computers have on people are not good.",6
840,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know that more than half the students in the world use the computer to study. I think that people don't spend a lot of time on the computer. And even if they are it's for studying learning of catching up with old friends. Here are some reasons why I think that computers have good effects on people. Most kids use computers to learn about things they are doing in class. And they also use the computer to study about a country or a person they are doing a report on. Also there are games on the computer that can help you with math. Now onto my secod reason. You can also use the computer to send emails to friends that live faraway, and also you could use things like facebook to find friends that had moved away. And you could also use a video camera to video chat with a friend or if you are a business man or woman you could videochat with clients all across the country. Now onto my third and final reason. Computers also have applications like microsoft word which lets you type things such as essays or term papers instead of having to write them out by hand. Also there is an application that lets you make a powerpoint if you need to make one for a project. And there is an application that lets you paint pictures or draw pictures. Those are some reasons why I think that computers have good effects on people. If we didn't have computers the world would be very different like kids wouldn't be able to search things for projects or type essays. And you wouldn't be able to keep contact with someone who moved away. Also you wouldn't be able to make power points for projects. And that is why I think computers have a good effect on people.",8
841,"Dear editor of the @PERSON1, I heard you are writing a section in your newspaper about computers and I just thought I would voice my opinion. Personally, I think computers have a positive effect on people. First, I think computers are swell because you are able to learn things about faraway places, like countries on the other side of the world, from the comfort of your home. Also, the information on the internet can help with students' schoolworks. Finally, you are able to talk with other people on-line. These are just a few points why computers are very importent, that you should include in your article. First off, editor of the @PERSON1, I think computers are good for mankind becasue you are able to learn about places on the other side of the world, while sitting at home drinking hot cocoa. This is so very convinient. There are websites containing the geography, languages, and traditions of countries waiting for you to learn. For example, once my friend, @PERSON3, was planning on going to @LOCATION1 for a business trip, but had no idea how to speak the language. I recommended the website, www.Indianow.com and in two weeks she was speaking like an expert. Another time, my sister, @PERSON4, was visiting her in-laws for the first time. They were full @CAPS1 and she wanted to bake something traditional for them. She looked up a recipe on the web and everyone was satisfied with the scrumptious ravioli she made. This is just one reason the internet is so useful. Second, computers are an amazing invention because you can find help for schoolwork easily. My brother, @PERSON5, was having problems with learning about the seasons, but with one click, he was full of knowledge. Also, now-a-days they even have on-line tutors and on-line colleges! Professor @PERSON2 states that @PERCENT1 of passing college students are earning their degree online. This is a fabulous point on why computers are so important. Lastly, computers are really significant to society because you are able to talk with other people online. With videochat, chatrooms, facebook and @CAPS2, you are bound to make a friend who would last a lifetime. I know I did! There are even on-line dating sites and matchmakers. For instance, after mu uncle divoriced my aunt, she was devastated and couldn't date again for the longest time. I told her to try one of those on-line dating sites, she took my advice and found a lovely man. They have been dating for @NUM1 months. Last @DATE1 he proposed. They are now happily engaged. This is my last reason how computers can change someone's life in a positive way. In conclusion, I think computers are a fantastic inevntion because you are able to learn about faraway places while staying at home. recieve help with your schoolwork, and talk with other people on-line. I really hope you will consider my opinion for your article, editor of the @ORGANIZATION1. Thank you for your time.",10
842,"Dear local newspaper, The question that everyone is asking is do computers benefit to society. I used to think they didn't benefit to society but now I think they do. I think this because, one good place to get information, two we live in a technological advanced society, and three you can keep in touch with people that are at the other side of the world. so do computers really benefit to our society? Computers are a valuable resorce for me when I need to get information. For example, in my recent project in social studies class I need to go on the computer to get information on the subject. Also if you need facts on something and you can't go to the libary the computer has the same information. Also the computer is helpful when trying to find maps to a certain place or a phone number to a store. The computer is and always will be a great source of information. In the @DATE1 technology is a huge part of society. For example the first computer that came out was this huge block that when you did something on it you would put in cardboard card. Now we havethin and small portable computers. So knowing how to use a computer is vital to keep up with the @DATE1. So are you going to let technology pass you by? Computers are one of the best ways to keep in touch. For example if you call someone across the world your phone bill will sky rocket. But if you go on a website like facebook you can talk for free. Also another way to chat with people is by A.I.M. Another free way to talk to people. What same person wouldnt want to talk to their friends and family acroosthe worl, for free? The reasons I have given you are valid reasons with deatails. Technology is like a train are you going to live it.",8
843,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I understand your one trying to decide whether or not computers are bad for people. I for one thing that computers are turning our society anti-social, we are becoming obese, and there is alot of cyber bullying that happens via computers. You can learn about all this and more if read on. @CAPS2 a stated earlier computers many problems in @LOCATION1's social lives. You see @CAPS2 much @CAPS2 @PERCENT1 of our population spends at least @NUM1 hours a ween on the computer. When doing this they are typically . watching videos or tweeting a friends. This @MONTH1 all swim like a activity but it is really pulling us away from our social lives. There are many sites that allow you to chat with your friends and leave messages on their ""wall"" but is that really communicating? In a way it is but it is taking away social skills that we will need later on. You can't get a job by instant messaging a person, you have to talk face to face. But how will we be able to do that if we only email and @CAPS3? Plus while so much you will be prone to using in , thus you with, nothing but a bad grade. Now we to problem that we see occuring all over . You the work on the computer. This activity what , they monitor, lets you at , everyday, since he comes home and plays on the computer and more time exercising. Finally we come to my last issue, cyber bullying. Over @PERCENT2 of @CAPS4 teens will be faced with some sort of cyber bullying in their life. When teens sion up for facebook and twitter they are signing up for depression. When a teen starts to get bullied they usually become sad which then leads them grades to go lower due to lack of concentration and that leads them to be more depressed and that could make them either commit suicide or join gangs and/or start making bad . But we can prevent this if we the of time people out @NUM2 spend on computers. And I think benifit that. In conclusion I believe that is we are bad for society. I think them is we the amount of time could be lives. I think that if you look deep down into what it to say how you will understand why we need to do healthier @LOCATION1? ",10
844,"Dear computer co., computers have a negative effect. Why would you go outside if you could play life - like games on your @CAPS1? I lthink that the games on th @CAPS1 should be removed so people could enjoy all of the great things in life. If people weren't on @CAPS1's all day, people would pay attention to the way they're destroying nature.",4
845,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 your computer ever crashed, and you needed to do a presentation? Well if so, that means you probably had to do your presentation on paper, the old fashioned way. Recently, there @CAPS1 been a debate going on between experts about computers. Some think they make your life more efficient while others think they make you spend too much time on them rather than outdoors. I believe that computers make our lives easier and that the advances in technology have a positive effect on people. I think this because it teaches you skills and updates you on info. around the world, it's efficient for work and helps the environment, and lastly, it let's people stay in touch. Computers have a positive effect on people because it let's family members stay in touch. Emails are an example of this. Instead of mailing a letter, you are electronically sending it. The person recieves it quicker and can answer ina more timely manner. Also, social networking sites help families keep in touch. One example of this is facebook. You can see what the person is doing and chat with them using facebook chat. I relate to this. My cousin lives in @LOCATION2, so I don't see him a lot. Through facebook, we can talk and update each other on our lives. Lastly, you can see pictures of your family. Many families have accounts on photo sharing sites. This enables them to see pictures or recent vacations or sporting events. They can comment and every member of the family can see how everyone looks/changes throughout the year. That is how computers let people stay in touch. Another reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches you skills and updates you on information. Computers teach you hand-eye coordination. When you type with a keyboard, you have to know where each letter is. This makes it possible to lok at the screen to recognize my errors. Hand eye coordination is a good skill for everyone to know. Computers update you on world news. Many homepage on the internet have news engines built into them. These news engines keep people updates on major news events. For example, the war in @LOCATION5, or more recently, the @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION4 earthquakes. Without the internet, we would be very behind on important news updates around the world. My last reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it is efficient for work and they help the environment. Computers help the environment because you are not using as much paper. Throughout the year, @CAPS2 use billions of sheets of paper to write letters. With computers that number goes down into the thousands. Why you @MONTH1 ask? Emails don't recquire paper. They are electronic, which means no paper. They are also environmentally friendly because news paper companies are going out of buisness. Due to online news paper news is becoming less and less popular. Computers are efficient for work because it is so easy to make presentations. There are so many programs to use, that making a big presentation could take minutes. That is why computers make work easy but help the environment at the same time. As you can see, computers have many positive effect on people. They let family members stay in touch, they teach you skills, and they are efficient for work while being environmentally friendly. That is why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Let me ask you this question again. @CAPS1 your computer ever crashed when you needed to do a big project? Now you know that computers make life efficient. What would you do without them? So now it's your turn, go out and buy a computer because you will be thankful you did.",10
846,"Computers do benefit are society. They have changed the world alot. You can do many things on the internet. On the computer, you can chat with people everywhere. The computer helps the world. These are ways how computers do benefit our society. There are many things you can do on the internet. You can play games with people. You can talk to people on certain websites. You can look up vaction spots. If your tired of being home, then just go on the internet. These are things you can do on the internet. On the computer, there are many settings. Out of all of them, chatting is the best. You can be playing a game and still chat. If you chatting with someone, you can still chat with another person. You can chat with people from across the world. This is why chatting is the best setting. Computer helps the world in many ways. It helps kids if they need to research something. It helps the cops catch the bad people. The computer helps parents get from their children by vaction ads. This is has the computer helps the world. The computer does benifit our society. It has change the world. You can do many things on it. On the computer, you can chat with people from anywhere. The computer helps the world everyday. This is how the computer benifits our society.",6
847,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers can have a positive effect or a negative effect on people. It all depends on how you look at it and what type of person you are. You can say computers have a very positive effect on people or say computers have a very negative effect on people. My opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people but you can't say that I am just a kid and she plays on it all the time. Well that is true however, it can teach you hand-eye coordination. For @CAPS2 what I am doing right now is learning to type faster and faster. Another @CAPS2 is some people are faster at typing than writing but some people write faster than type. Me personally am faster at than writing. My final reason is after a hard day at school or work you can come home, play some music and relax. It is a good idea to learn how to type fast so if you are let's say writing a story for school. You just started the story and it is due tomorrow. What are you going to do well if you stared to type when you were younger by the time you are in the middle school you could type really fast. That way you could finish your story in time. This means you should learn haw to type faster. Some people prefer to write than type but other people prefer to type than write. I personally prefer to type than write but that is just me. Let's say a friend of mine like to write more than type that is ok. We will not be not friends after that we will just like the same thing that is all. This means some people prefer to write than type. This probably happens after a hard day at school or work you can come home use the computer to play some music and relax. You can play all the music you want. As well as do other things as well as the same time. For @CAPS2, I play music and talk to my friends at the same time. I @CAPS3 use it to do homework. In conclusion, it is a good idea to keep computers to use. People can still enjoy nature as well as computers at the same time. Over all computers have a positive effect on people.",6
848,"Dear @CAPS1, I think some people are overreacting, its not really going to kill you. I'm not suggesting that people should stay on the computer all day. My last reason would be that nowadays everyone nos computers. Keep reading to find out about my three topics: @CAPS2 off way too many people are overreacting, I think so because people say ""you are going to miss out or you are missing out on life. Also you are still interacting with your family and friends, just not verbally (only typing). I don't know why people are so against computers, its like global warming, so many warnings and noone listens, so why will they listen to people saying that staying on a computer too long can make you fat. That was just my opinion/thoughts on that topic. Next off I am going to tell you about how a computer can't really kill you. It can't kill you because it is only a computer for one and another reason is that you can get obeast and bored because I can't stay on the computer for more than an hour because it just gives me a headache. Well that was another opinion of mine so read on to see what else I got. Now I am going to tell you how everyone has computers. The thing is computers are not the only things that cause obeisity. Every one has a computer now because I guess everyone goes on facebook, even my mom has a facebook! But theres also other websites like sexual, games and friend sites. The most used website I think is facebook. I think so because sooo many peole have it. Well this concludes my essay and now you know my opinions on how some people overreact, how its not really going to kill you and last how everyone has a computer.",8
849,"Dear @CAPS1, The effect that computers have on people is not a positive one. I think people spend way too much time on computers, some information on computers is inaccurate, there are still telephones and cellphones that people can use fir communication. A majority of peoples' time is spent on the computer. Whether its playing games, checking @CAPS2-mail, or even working, peoples' valuable time is getting used up. This time could be used by doing more important things such as being with friends and family, being outside with nature or exercising. Being on the computer insteads of exercising has had a huge effect on people. Some people are overweight because they eat and then do not exercise after. My sister works on the all day and she says @NUM1 or @NUM2 ladies at her work are un healthy because all they do is go on the the computer and eat granola bars, wich are usually healthy. If others spent at least a half an hour being outside to @CAPS3 some fresh air instead of using a computer most of them would feel a lot better. My doctor always used to tell me and my brother, ""@CAPS3 out and play an hour a day!"" This is true, and I strongly encourage people to go outside and do an activity as opposed to playing on the computer. The computer is used a lot for researching. Some of the information on the computer is very helpful, but you can never really know what information is inaccurate. At least when you research using a book or encyclopedia, you can trust those sources. What if you had to do a report and you could only use the internet, how would you be able to tell if the information is trustworthy? Sure, computers also teach hand-eye coordination by playing video games, but when in real life, will you need to know how to shoot a dragon or dodge candy that's falling from the sky? This is just an example of unneeded information and skills that keeps people wanting to go back on the computer. Another thing you can do on the computer is communicte with others. When computers weren't invented or even that advanced, people were more than happy to give one another a call. Now with computers, people @CAPS2-mail, instant message, or even skype; a webcam website. What even happened to cellphones, you can take.",10
850,"I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because they teach hand-eye codination, also give people the ability to and lastly they allow people to talk online. First, they teach hand eye codination and I think thats good because when people get a job they can probably more focused and can probably work faster. So if people can do that when they get a job and their jobs involve working on a computer it can be easier for them and their job can be more enjoyable. Second they give people the ability to learn more because we have all these sites that involve information an everything so people can be more knowledge so if they're more knowledged they can probably get a really good job that pays alot. And they can look up whatever they like. So if they reasearch alot and go to school they can get the job they always wanted because they know so much knowledged people are better people. Lastly they can talk to online people when people can contact each other its better because if they have no phone to reach someone they need to reach they got a computer that they can either email or use a webcam were they can see the person. I think that having a computer is good for all these reasons having hand eye cordination give people the ability to learn more and allow people to talk online with other people.",8
851,"Computers. An achievement @MONEY1 technology and science that improve all @MONEY1 our lives. They let you explore the world in one click and chat with your friends. What could be wrong with that? I'll tell you. I belive that computers are ruining our society. Now don't get me wrong, I like them, but they can be bad. People get on and never get off, you never no who it is your chating with online, and they can cause tons @MONEY1 stress. Let me explain why computers can ruin lives. When the computer was invented I'm sure this wasn't the purpose. To stay on playing mindless games, or randomly searching the web. Some scientists have even studied the @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 the time, the more you are online, the more likely chance you will become obiece. That is not what @LOCATION1 needs. You say you'll be on for a minute, but you will stay playing ""@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" for days on end. People with @CAPS3 work to do might never get on. Also it is just flat out a waste @MONEY1 time when you could be outside playing a @CAPS3 game. My second reason is that when you are ""chatting"" or ""@CAPS4'ing"" someone, who is it really? A study conducting proved that when you think your talking to a friends it is really some perverted @NUM1 year-old looking for ""fun."" @CAPS5 huh? Also when you talk, someone could be inbedding a virus in your system that could take @MONEY1 to fix. How mad would your parents be? It could be happening with every letter you press. Finally stranger or not, some @MONEY1 these people leave links to get to disgusting websites that you pray your parents don't see. My final point is that computers are proven to cause more stress. When your on @CAPS6 or @CAPS7, nasty fueds between friends can occur that affect you and your school work, inflicting damge to your grades. For every @NUM2 people when join a social page, @NUM1 get worse grades do to this issue. Also when your parents are online for a long time, the next morning they must rush to get ready for work and are tired, afffecting their quality @MONEY1 work. In this economy I don't think we need more layoffs. Even simple things like a virus or a slow upload could and will cause stress, in fact @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 @LOCATION1 have a stress issue due to computers. I've told you today why computers are bad. They get sucked in stressed out and stalked. Now computers aren't all bad, just use them right. These are the reasons I think computers can be bad.",11
852,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A regular day for a person, with a computer, includes at least three hours using the computer per day. Today, people, especially teens, spend their precious hours wasting time on sites like facebook, myspace @CAPS1 and more! Just think about it, just sitting in a chair with your eyes gluded to the computer when you could be exercising, spending time with family and friends or enjoying nature? After all do we really need a computer? Obesity is one of the highest concerns in the country today. However, we can prevent it! We are certainly not helping this issue when we have childre. Adults sitting in a chair for a large part of their day doing absolutley nothing! We are so fortonate, our town has at least two physical fitness buildings for anyone can attend instead of using the computer. ANd even if you can't attend a gym you could easily walk around your neighborhood. There are running program held at our local beach, @LOCATION1, where you can exercise or even run a small competition! Please exercising is key to everybody's health and there are numerous ways to exercise, but using the computer is not one of them! Teachers, parents, children writers everyone lets stay away from the computers and stay fit! Family and friends are those who make us truly hapy but if we on the computer how are we going to see them? More and more people are making less effort to see people in person. Instead many people video chat through cameras on the computer. We need to change this habit. Everybody needs to socialize face to face. If we socialize through computers our socializing skills could worsen because you are not practicing the socializing skills like eye contatct. Instead of talking to people online we could be enjoying with those same people at an amusment park, a restaurant, at a park or simply in our barkyard/house. The world is so beautiful with so many places to see but society is too busy to see it because we're on computer for a long time. Our computers use up so much energy and is a threat to the world, @CAPS2 @CAPS3! Instaed of entertaining ourselves on computer we could be taking hikes, walks on the beach even our street or playing outside in our yard. On a computer you can see a magestic places like beaches but you can't interact with them. If we get off our computer we could be swimming at a beach or a pool! Nature is so beautiful, why ever it? @PERCENT1 of residents in @LOCATION1 own computers and spend a lot of thier day on it. We could be improving obesity, spending more time with family and friends, and exploring Nature! lets make a shange so we can do all of these things!",10
853,"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I strongly believe that people should cut down on using the computer. Just imagine, more people outside and healthy. Less “cyberspace” bullying, and less burning of electricity. My first reason why people should spend less time on the computer and more outside is because @PERCENT1 of people that use the computer more than two hours a day are either at risk of being overweight or are overweight. Also, @PERSON1, from @ORGANIZATION1 says “@CAPS2 people believe that using the computer gives you benefits, but they don’t. They increase your chances of either being overweight or getting diseases such as diebeties. It’s imperative that the community takes action to stop this from happening. “In addition, my neighbor, @PERSON2 had to do a study to interview overweight adults and teenagers. @CAPS3 told me that @PERCENT2 of the @NUM1 people @CAPS3 interviewed said they don’t go outside and use the computer for about @NUM2 hours a day! I implore the citizens of the @LOCATION1 area to cut down on internet time and go outside to enjoy nature. My second reason is the less people on the computer means less cyberspace bullying. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people that use the socializing websites have experienced more than @NUM2 encounters of cyberbullying also my sisters friend, @PERSON3, overdosed on advil so @CAPS3 ran comitt suicside because of cyber bullying. Someone had said @CAPS3 was ugly, smelled and should ""go die in a hole."" @CAPS3 didn't tell anyone about this. Luckily her mother brought her to @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1 fast enough to be put on life support for @NUM6 hours. furthermore, if people cut down on internet socializing website than less people will be in danger of cyberbullying affecting their lives. It's excruciating imperative for people to use the computer for only @NUM7 or @NUM8 hours a day. My final reason is, the less time you use your computer the less money you would be wasting on electricity bills and spending more time on family vacations. Dr. @DR1, from the peabody museum in @LOCATION2 begs people to use less electricity and power on the internet so the environment can slowly rebuild itself to be what it was before technology and electricity was invented. In addition, @PERCENT3 of power used in todays homes is used on computers. Also my grandmother is astounded by what todays technology is doing to the environment and the people behind this madness or electricity. @CAPS3 believes that the less time on the computer means more time on family vacations and with friends. Lastly, it's extremly imperative that people stop using computers as much to help their health their self estem and environment. A case take action to stop using computer @NUM9. Thank you for reading my paper.",10
854,"You've got mail! @CAPS1 my computer which is filled with emails from distant relatives and friends. Without computers, I would not be able to keep in touch with these people as efficiently as I can with computers. In the past few decades, technology has been drastically advancing, resulting in the incredible computers, with computers we can type faster, communicate with distant relatives, and find information like ever before. Because of this incredible invention, computers have allowed us to do @LOCATION1 things that are truly astonishing. To begin, we have thrown away typr writers and purchased computers. Now like never before, we can type faster, improve hand eye cordination, and edit our papers without the help of a peer. First of all, with the extreene amounts of typing needed for colleges, most occupations, and everyday list, computers have made this faster and easier process. I am sure most of the things you have to type for @LOCATION1 are written using a computer. Secondly we have gained amazing hand-eye cordination skills. Furthermore, be typing and reading at the same time, we have trained or eyes to do many @LOCATION1 things similar to playing the piano. Lastly, now with spell check, we are able to edit papers without using someone elses help! The computer can sense problems in an instant, which is even more effective without a doubt, the typing documents aspect of computers is @CAPS5 one reason why we need them around. Another reason is because of communication. Thanks to many @LOCATION1 communication applications such as @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, we can now communicate with a surplus of distant friends and relatives. For example, with both my sisters at college it was hard for me to communicate with them however, due to @CAPS2, I can see their pictures, instant message them, and even video chat! Without computers, being able to see their pictures and what they are up to would have never been possible. Secondly, email has created a fast, easy way to update people on schedule changes, ideas and even sales and specials offered by stores! Snail mail is no more with this extreemly efficient way of communication! Clearly, the communication aspect of computers is an explicit reason why we need them in our lives. Last but not least, computers have allowed us to access information like never before. We can now find facts and figures, faster, easier, and with hundreds more optinions, within seconds, thanks to @ORGANIZATION1 and other search engines, we can find the information we need. Not to mention, the process is exceedingly @CAPS5 type in exactly what you are looking for and you will be brought to exactly what you need! Thirdly, there is many more options and sites to choose from. For example, if you were to type in a certain animal there would be an overdose of pages pertaining to your topic. Now, it is possible to find exactly what you are looking for! There is no question that computers have made searching for information easier and faster, which is exactly why we need them in our everyday lives. Conclusively, computers are an astonishing invention that has opened @LOCATION1 doors for today's society. Without computers we would not be able to type documents as quickly, communicate, and find information in a fashion. However, because of this invention, computers have allowed us to do incredible things. People all across the country are expenencing the efficiency of using computers and now we can to! It is evident, that computers are effective, and are advancing technology in our society.",11
855,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 people think that computers educate people for the future but I think that they actually harm children and adults as well. First of all, kids are so wraped up in computer games that they never go out and exercise. Second, if you ask a child anything about nature they will probably not know what to say, but they would if they spent less time on the computer. Finally, many families today never see each other because kids and their parents are too busy on the computer. These three reasons show why computers don't benefit society. Obesity is a huge problem among the children in @LOCATION1. The reason for this is that they are spending too much time online and not outdoors and exercising. Kids are not getting any fresh air or exercise and this can lead to serious health conditions. Parents sometimes don't do anything about it because they they have the same problem. This just shows that computers and other technology are effecting families around the country by making them overweight and. @CAPS1 children don't know the first thing about nature and. People say that computers educate people about things but nature and the environments is a big of our lives. The best learn about it and help. Computers the time they are, the earth might become even worse so they need to get educated on nature and the environment so they can. I know from my own experience that computers take away time from your friends and family. Instead of playing games on the computer at home, you could be spending time with your family in the park or the pool. My dad always spend his time on the computer and we never had time to spend with him. When he realized this he rearanged his schedual so we could have more time together. It is very important to spend time with your family because they are such a big part of your life and less of computer will help families do that. As you can see, getting off the computer will help kids stay in shape and healthy, educate them on the enviornment, and help families interact with each other more. If getting off the computer changed my families lifestyle then it will do the same to others as well. Hopefully you agree with me because it will surely tak a positive affect. ",10
856,"Dear Local newspaper, I think computers are great sources. They help us instanly when we have to find something. Computers are very helpful and they are easy to use. Once you have mastered the computer it feels like you can do almost anything on it. Computers are great but the can also have negative effects on us too. I like, computers but I am going to say I am against them. When people get on their computers it's like they're in another world. When your on the computer you are alot less socal than you would be if you not on the computer. On don't know about you but alot of people are addicted to their computers. They get on an they stay on forever. The act like it is a neccesity to be on the computer every day. I do not have to be on computer websites like @CAPS1 and here is why. Compters get really annoyting sometimes. They distract people alot. Like the other day my sister and I were going to @NUM1 walking but we didn't go because she wouldn't help us exercise so we shouldn't be using it. In this economy it is important to have socal skills. Instant messaging people doesn't mean you are going socal skills. You actually have to get out and talk to people face to face. When I am on the computer to long I know. I know this because my eyes start to hurt. This is bad for your eye sight. People sit in their houses and just stare at the bright screen. They @MONTH1 not know but that is blinding so they must not stay on the computers long. These were some reason why you should not use the computer. I am not saying that it is an evil contraption I'm just saying, use the computer for info and work not for games and other things. You could be outside having fun instead of sitting up in your house so get out! Go make some real breathing friends in person.",8
857,"Dear @PERSON1, To this day, there are many people who use telecommunication devices, like the computer. Some think computers have a posotive effect on people. Others are concerned that people spend too much time on them. I think that both these opinions are correct. Although using a computer can become an addicting and unhealthy habbit, they teach a person everyday about something, are enjoyable, and help save the earth. Using computers is something I know millions of people use everyday, and would think @CAPS2 would be difficult to live without. For example, my family owns four computers. We each have our own specific reasons for using them. For my mom, @CAPS2's usually working or checking her e-mails. For me and my sister, @CAPS2's researching and typing of homework, and communicating with our friends via facebook or. So say when my mom is working, or me and my sister are researching something we learn. Before these were computers, everyone used, but now that we have the internet, theres no really need to get a book. Most of the time people wont even have the book their looking either have to go out and buy get one from the library. Now this is an inconvenience to people, so why not use the internet thats quick, and. People also use computers to like I mentioned above with maybe facebook, @CAPS1, or e-mail.@CAPS2's quick, easy and fun. @CAPS2 also saves paper which helps the planet. We always use to send letters, but now with these sources, you don't need to much! Computers are also fun for kids because you can play a lot of games on bring. Now even though I mentioned all those good things, there are unfortunately bad ones too. So many people use computers everyday, and @CAPS2's bad for your physical and mental health. People spend so much time on them that they can get easily addicted. This means they will be on them all the time, and never do other things like go outside. They wasn't exercise which could be bad for their physical health. Also, staring at a screen all day is bad for your eyes, and brain. So I think, due to these causes, people shouldn't use them constantly. In conclusion, I'd like to say that people should use computers for learning things, go outside or do something active because spending all this time on computers can result in physical and mental health issues. Thank you and I hope you agree with my statements.",10
858,"Dear editor, I hear you are looking for your citizens opinion in if computers are bad or good. @CAPS1 opinion is computers are bad. I think computers are bad in three ways and I want to express them to your and hopefully persuade you into going towards @CAPS1 side. Smell nice out to day. I can smell flowers, the grass, and many more, @CAPS1 first reason why computers are bad is if you use the computer to much you don't see enough of enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful, it has @CAPS2, green grass, rainbows (sometimes). You can make a walk of in the moons and just be yourself and be by yourself. In other words nature is very nice and you should set out and enjoy it. If you don't enjoy nature it might be no late, because soon it become and rainy and then, yes fem has flabberlasting colors, but what comes after fall, winter. Winter is not nice, it is cold. You work, because you need to shovel the drive way and your car off and that can get very tire some. The goof of is you can get those chorse. Oh not that make me to. @CAPS1 next reason why computers are bad. When was a good smile run. @CAPS1 next reason why I think computers are bad is spend all working and no time exersing. Excersing is a very fun thing to do, you fel to go outside. Hang with friends, any many shore. Exercise is a main way of staying healthy. don't you can really get unhealthy, and sick and his dies, die i have a friend whom nothing use. The computer his body rest weaker and weaker so exercise ias am main piece of staing healthy. there are many ways to health you can bike, run, walk, rog canate, climb a mountain, etc. The posibilitys are endless while exercesing in the park you never knew you can meet. car's fast say your friend, ""yo sup man,"" ""not, you"" ""not much, just fiding around for some exercise"" ""same here, same here"" see you never know who you can meet in the park now that was @CAPS1 friend. he is alwasys here, out how as you think, yep in the same park. I wouldn't have met him if i was insine on the computer. Like i said be what was @CAPS1 friend. But since I come here every day i can meet a new friend every day maybe. So @CAPS1 last reason why I think the computer is bad is because you don't get enough interacting time with friends and family. I love @CAPS1 family but I interact with them. If they are exercising who if i am here on the computer. no one can. In conclusion I think the computer are bad because you can not get enought time exercising, enjoying nature, and spending @CAPS3 time with family and friends.",9
859,"What is technology? Technology is defined as anything that helps enhance our way of living. Technology is all around us. Our beds, houses, televisions and even chairs are all forms of technology. There is one form of technology however, in my opinion, has revolutionized modern day living as we know it. This form of technology is called the computer. My outlook on the effect the computer has had on our society is quite positive. Just think of all of the things we rely on this device to do. There is one thing, however that really sticks out in my mind; @CAPS1. The computer is perhaps the greatest form of @CAPS1 the world has ever seen. E-mail is basically sending a letter to a friend without the hassle of mailing it out where it might get lost or stolen. E-mailing is two simple steps: @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. Not only does it lower the risk of the letter not getting there, but it is also much quicker. You hit the ""sen"" button and before you know it, a new letter is sitting in you friends inbox. Another method of computerized @CAPS1 is my personal favorite, instant messaging. Instant messaging allows you to have a conversation with someone that could be miles away. And it's okay if you decide to go get a soda while you are instant messaing because unlike a real conversation, that isn't rude. These are just two methods of @CAPS1 that the computer enables us to have. Tehre is a variety of other that, much like these two, enhance our way of life. I believe that the main reason the computer has enhanced our life so much is because of one giant thing: the internet. The internet makes everything we do on the computer possible. If i want to gon on the computer and do research on a topic, the internet takes me where i want to go. With millions of different websites, the internet has endless possibilities. If I'm interested in arcade games, I can go on the internet and play them. If i have to write a science report, then i can go on the internet and collect research. If i want to listen to music, tehn i can go on the computer, look up a song, and listen to it. And guess what? If i'm looking for a funny video just for a good laugh, then the internet can find me one! The internet is perhaps one of the greatest things ever invented. It's just another reason to love the computer.",9
860,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 do you feel about the advantages and disadvantages of owning a computer? I think that computer help in many different ways. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, helps us learn, and we can even talk online with friends and family. Do you ever think about @CAPS1 you computer can help you phisicly? Many parents state that, ""@CAPS2 spend to much time on the computer!"" but what they don't know is that the computer is teaching them hand-eye cordination. Parents argue that kids wagh more because they sit inside on the computer, but if they do sertain things to limit the @CAPS2 like only goind on sertain games, limiting there time on the computer, or making them play outside the same amount of time they were on the computer the kids could be learning while still staying fit. This is why a computer could be a way important part of a childs life if used properly. What is you method of learning? Maybe you read books, go to school or even watch @CAPS3. But what if you arn't at school, or have any books around? What if your @CAPS3 isn't telling you what yo need to know? Well, with a computer you can look up almost anything with just few clicks of a button. If you don't have time to take a trip to you local library to a book, @CAPS1 would you learn? As teen who attends school I know that I would not be able to do a lot of my school work and projects without my computer. A lot of the at home jobs today require computers, and without the computers the job would not be getting done. This is why I think computers benifit our society and knowledge. Does everyone you know live in one are? Probably not this is why websites like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are getting more and more members each day. Ther internet helps us keep intuch with relatives friends and ever helps us meet new people. I know that the internet helps me heep in tuch with old friends.",9
861,"Do you think computers are helpful?

862,"Dear @LOCATION1 press, I believe that computers have a terrible impact on society, the reason I believe this is true is that kids can go ""braindead"" as some people call it. Also kids can get obese witch is already a greatly growing process. The last reason is that kids get bad eye sight from it. The first reason I believe that computers have a bad impact on our society is that all kids do is sit there and eat while they are on the computer and they get an addiction to it so they just keep getting fatter because they arn't getting any exercise. This problem with children getting fat is already a very brought up topic and with something like this out it's not going to get any better any time soon. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of kids who are on the computer more than a hour and a half a day are actually going braindead. This means that if this becomes the new trend for all kids that our next generation will not be smart and won't be able to keep up with other countries and fall behind, so we have to do something about this trend setting issue if you want our country to stay in one piece. The last but not least reason is kids are forming a bad eye sight. This can also bad for future generations. If you let this catch on the generation will all need glasses its almost like a domino effect. These are all the reasons that computers have a bad impact on the society. kids get obese, they go braindead, and they develop bad eye sight from it.",8
863,"I think that computer are a good benefit for people because those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. For example, they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, people and even allow people to talk with other people. My first reason, is that important people around the world used computers to have a better future on life. The people that use computers have important jobs. For example, a judge, an enginere, a lawyer, an archytecht, a scientist, an archeologist etc... This is why I think that computer are helpfull for people. My second reason, is that computer could be helpful with kids because computers could help kids get better grades at school. It could help develop a smarter brain in many ways. The first way that it could help develop a smarter brain is reading a lot on the compute. It helps by knowing the meaning of new words. I helps you speak correctly and clear. That is why I think that computers help develop a smarter brain. My third reason is that it help adult connect to different places at the world. That could be a hobby for adults that does not have something to do could have a good time. My conclusion is that with computer you could have a better life. Computers could help you get a better future.",8
864,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that the idea of advances in technology benefiting society is a very controversal topic. However, I support these advances in technology and I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They allow friends and family who live far away from each other to communicate and stay in touch. Computers @CAPS7 allow easy access to the news and online textbooks which provides an enourmous amount of benifits to today's society. In the long run, doing more things by computer instead of on paper will save billions of trees! @CAPS7, computers teach us hand-eye coordination which is a tremenciously important skill. These advances in technology are extremely benefitial to our society and should be taken advantage of! ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1!"" @CAPS3 computer wails as I recieve a video call from @CAPS3 cousin, @PERSON4. The advantage in technology has provided many new ways for @CAPS3 family and I to communicate with each other. @CAPS3 cousins and I rarely see one another, but computers make it possible for us to stay connected. Four out of five teenagers would agree that without computers or technological advances, their long-distance relationships with family and friends wouldn't be possible. For example; I go on oovoo once a week to video chat with @CAPS3 cousin whom I only see on holidays. Teen @CAPS4, @PERSON2 says: ""Technology such as computers and cell phones are great for teens, but it should be monitored and not used excessively."" Computers are great for keeping in touch with family and friends at a distance! Next, computers allow easy access to the news and online textbooks. @CAPS5 more people took advantage of this, we could sace millions of trees and have a healthier environment. Environmentalist, @PERSON3 says: ""@CAPS5 more schools switched to online textbooks they would end up saving thousands of dollars that can be put elsewhere."" I agree, @CAPS3 friend @PERSON1 says. ""@CAPS5 we didnt have to take home so many textbooks everyday, I might not have scoliousis!"" @CAPS7, computers allow quick access to the news, so we can find out about accidents right away instead of waiting for the newspaper to come. @CAPS7, computers help children develop hand-eye coordination, which is a very important skill. Computer activities keep our brain excercising and @MONTH1 even help us hit more accurately next baseball season! Three out of five kids at @ORGANIZATION2 say that @CAPS5 they didn't have a computer growing up, they wouldn't be as good at their sport.

865,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 have effects on people and there lifes. Cause alot of people as in children spend there time after school plan games, myspace, facebook and there e-mail address. Instead of going on computers. I think that children and adults should go-out and have good time theres not a problem with going on the computer once and awhile but if you spend all days on a computer then thats pretty bad. Adults shouldnt let there children spend all day on a computer and adults shouldn't eather because it went help you life. Computers could mess your life up by choices you make and pictures you put up and things you write up there such as if you have a myspace or facebook and you put bad pictures up in you furture when you want a good job they could just look back at that and say look at this I don't want this person working for me. and there you go messing up your furture. instead of going on the computer all the time you could go outside do sports to keep your body health and go out in the world and learn new things or even plan trips to go on with your family walk around and stuff like the instead of going on the computer's and putting your self at risk of looseing job or messing up your future. You shouldn't let computer's mess your life up because if you do then your life want be the same children could mess there life up because things they wrote or pictures they put up witch other kids could see and be mean to them and talk about them fot the rest of there school year or things could lead to a fight over one little word you said or picture you put up because you thought it was cute. Sex offenders are on computers and some people don't even no it intill they get tookin away or killed. Parents don't always no when there is sex offender around or online talking to you or your children trying to go meet up with them. They also could put fake pictures up to try to get you to speak to them or to get you to meet them some where so they could take you. so you shouldn't let the computers get to you.",8
866,"Wouldnt it be great to use computers in everyday life? In this country we can. You can use it to talk to people you never thought you would see again. Looking at places far away is always an option. You can even simply use it to help with homework essays. Locating and researching, even going to different countries, even different continents is possible to do on the computer. You can buy plan tickets. reserve rooms, even reserve tables at resturants in different countries by just a few clicks. Another thing is, you can research countries, towns, and cities with google instead of having to go out and get books. Reading about and talking to people from different countries is always an option. Being able to talk. and read about people and go to countries just by a clicking a button is pretty amazing. Computers also allow us to talk and communicate to people when there is no other way. The computers give people the ability to talk and see people they they the would never communicate with anymore. An example of this is my father hadn't see his father since he was two, but he started communicating with him and we were able to see him and chat with him through web chat. So these web chatting websites; ooVoo, facebook, myspce, skype, etc, is allowing people to reconnect. This advantage is allowing friendships and relationships to continue, is that really bad? Computers can help people with their homework and essays. For instint, they can type and print their essays instead of having to write it on paper. This helps because first it makes their, it also can be changed quicker and easier. They also can get information about what they are studying quickly and more efficiently. Instead of searching for a word in a big dictionary they can use an online dictionary and just have to type in the word. Online dictionary also have prounociation help and different langages. This helps so much so they can get their work done and exercise, enjoy nature, or interact with family and friends. I hope you will take my opinion seriously and think about it is using computers for daily needs really that bad?",9
867,"Dear sir, I belive that computers are great for society. There are lots of benefits to having a computer to use. You can talk to people online with instant message, it is a lot more dependable than a telephone or cell phones. Lots of time people don't answer thhe phone when you need them. With a computer you can send a message from the computer to the persons cellular device. You can lern a lot from a computer, suc as things about the world, people around the world, yo can lern things from the internet youre teacher can't even teach you. Then you can study and expand youre knolage. It is a problem if your on the computer more than you exersize but with techology today you can get exersize wile useing a computer. You can play music from it while you workout, of what moivie while running on a tredmill. Even though people go on the computer to much ways to exersize and use the computer at the same time. So there is ups and downs but in the end, it dosen't matter how much you use the computer, you can get exersize at the same time thats why I think it is a benifits to have computers today.",6

Kids need to use the computer because it's another way for them to communicate with each other. Textings good but it costs money, so does to lking on the phone. If a doesn't have texting they can go on facebook or something to make make plans to do something with a friend. What if it's a rainy day outside and there's nothing to do? Well that's what a computer for.Kids use the computer for entertainment. There's tons of games to play. All on different websites of course but that's beside the point. There's mmorpg or rpg those are two type of games I can think of computers are like kids own virtual outside world. Computers are also needed to do research for school projects. Also to get pictures. Sure there book but they don't always have everything you're looking for. You can't cut pictures out of books. You need a good grade on a project. Therefore computers need to be used a lot. for communication, entertainment, and school projects.",7
869,I believe that computers benefit society. They make life easier. Computers allow now of communication between friends. They also teach you new things. Computers make our lives easier. They let us look things up by easier means than a person or book. It has made it simpler to type reports. Now you don't have to worry about making mistakes on a typewriters and having to type it again. A computer saves the report and shows you some mistakes to take case of your children. It allows you to from your home. Computers allow new means of communication. You can talk online with friends. Social networks such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 allow that. Computers allow you to converse with friends you don't normally get to see or talk to. They also make it easier and more fun to make new friends. Computers teach us new things. They teach you about places you haven't seen before. Any question you can be asked on the internet and you will get an answer. It gives you answer you don't know who to ask for. Computers also teach hand-eye coordination. You can play games online or with @CAPS3's. You need to have good hand-eye coordination in order to play these games. Computers have a positive effect on people of all ages. They make our lives easier with their technology. They allow us to communicate with our friends through social networks. Computers also teach us new things such as hand-eye coordination. All these reasons and more are why I believe that computers benefit our society.,8

And don't forget get that they offer ways to chat online. Have you ever played a game of baseball where you just can't seem to just hit the ball? Well, sounds like you need to work on your hand eye coordinator. Studies have shown that @PERCENT2 of people that use computers have an increased hand eye when doing activities like sports or games. So if you use a computer, you'll be hitting homeruns, not striking out. After you've won your baseball game, it's time for homework, and guess what? Your teacher assigned a project that's due tomorrow! Don't panic, get online! Computers help you learn and research, which is faster than going to the library and getting a book. Say you need the date olympic gold medalist @PERSON1 was born, google it! Finally, once you have your information all you have to @CAPS2 is your source. Ok, now your homework is done and you want to talk to your friend about your plans on @DATE1. Computers offer numerous ways to chat online. There's @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, woVoo, @CAPS7, and many more. So you sign into @CAPS7, and talk with your best friend. Now your not bored anymore. Computers are a great way to decrease boredom, just by talking with friends online, but you better go to bad soon because you have @ORGANIZATION1's in the morning! As you can see, computers are incorporated into our daily lives. They're everywhere! I believe that they're changing society, mostly for the better. They teach hand eye coordination, help you research and learn, and let you chat with friends. Additionally, if you don't already have a computer, then get one!",9
871,"I saw in one of the news papers I got in the mail that had an overnight for people to state their opinion on kids computer useage. I took the idea of waiting this letter. Multiple people do have to use computers for multiple things. Such as: homework assignments such as essays, sometimes peoples family members go off to was but can't use cell phones, also online job alpications. To start off with, kids have homework assignment right? Most of the time people have to do essays. I ask my mom lots of times if I can do an essay for school, she say, ""why don't you stay after to do it?"" @CAPS1 have lives so they can't stay after, also at school the computers don't let you go on most websites unlike at home which does. That's mostly one main reasons kids use computers alot. Next,, some family members go off to war. Normally for safly and privacy, they wont let the soldiers life their cellphones, but for other reasons they can use their computers. Usually your family members know that you have a computer and want to contact you so that they to know their ok so they don't have to for two years. So, the base they ace at you can talk to them over video mail. I have an @CAPS2 that went to @ORGANIZATION1 and is now in @LOCATION2, and we sometimes talk to him over chat when he was in @LOCATION1. Lastly, job aplications. Most of the time people are home bound but need a job. Tons of @CAPS3 commertials show avertisements for jobs online. This is good for all types for people, homebound, elderly, ect. But mostly its good because they sometimes let you have your own business and you get good pay still. In conclution, Some people don't go online just to be online they actually are doing something such as talking to their loved ones that they wont see for along period of time, also school assignments. Plus, if people don't know people very well how do they know if they're active or not kids, and adults, should still be able to use computers when ever they want.",8
872,"Dear Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1 has an essay due on plants for science tomorrow. She was absent @DATE1 and didn't know about it. If she had a computer, she could go on to the website and check, but she doesn't. The town took them away. Another student, @LOCATION1, is working on the same essay. Her handwriting is terrible so her teacher will not be able to score it. What are they to do? Although many some say that computers are not good for society, most know that life without computers would be a disaster. New @CAPS1 is currently thinking about taking away computers in our town. This would be a big problem for everybody involved. One reason is that people need it to get information from search engines like ""google"" and ""yahoo"". They also use the internet for communication like ""facebook"" and ""aim"". Taking away computers would drastically impact every day life. Society computers to get information. I know that whenever I don't know something I just look it up online. If I didn't have this resource, my homework would not be as detailed as it is with the computer. Another example is that public look up information about the world on my computer. When many heard about earthquake in @LOCATION2, they could pull up information within seconds. This led to many bake sales and fund raisers. Lastly, when kids miss their favorite @CAPS2 shows one day, they can just look it up the next day to get caught up. This is a big part of teenager life. Society needs computers in order to look up crucial information. Many people also use the internet for communication purposes. I know that in my family ""e-mail"" is what makes it all work. My mom makes all her plans by email and sometimes even e-mails herself from work to remember things. Without it, our family would not be able to function. Another mode of communication is ""facebook"". Any time my friends and I have a question about anything anything that happened that day. We will ask each other on this website. It is safe and saves all the trouble of calling on the phone. A final example is ""aim"". This is a messaging tool that lets you talk instantly with friends and even see them with ""video-chatting"". My friends and I would not be able to show each others outfits and other items without ""aim"". Teenagers as well as adults need to communicate through computers. In conclusion, society needs computers in order to look up info, as well as talk with friends and co workers. Do not even think about ",10
873,I think computers have a postitive affect on people. Computers are very important to society. You can still interact with Your Family and friends either in @CAPS1 chat or @CAPS2. Computer are also helpful for applying for @CAPS3 like you can look for @CAPS3 you like. You can do @CAPS5 exciseses and useful for @CAPS5 essays. If you have a laptop you can bring it anywhere you want you don't have connect anything it take wireless and you can connect to the @CAPS6. You can look up stuff on the @CAPS6 for your homework and other stuff. Buy things without having to go to the store. These are reasons why computers have a postitive affect on people.,6
874,"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you about the use of computers and how they are bad for society. With people getting less exercise, not enjoying nature, and having less interactions they are doing the world more bad than good. Almost everyone has a computer and it gets used more and more and it is just taking away a great time to go be active outside. First, exercise is a very important part of the day and it is happening less and less because kids are sitting infront of there computers all day long. There is so much talk these days how we are the fatest country. Well here is one of the main causes we have almost everyone stairing blankly into a computer screen instead of being active. Computers are a big problem and they cause laziness to occure more often than not because now if you miss your favorite @CAPS1.V. show just look online you will find it. Or if you are doing a project just look online and you will find more than enough information and it is just a click away.Second, enjoying nature is a scarse thing now. All you have to do is search online and you could find a picture of your front yard. there are much less people outside. Because who needs to go outside when you could be chatting with a friend or just being on @ORGANIZATION1 looking up new technology. People who are always on the computer don'@CAPS1 care about the enviorment as much because they are wasting electricity and they are more fun to internet on their place that they on. There are a lot less people going places now because who needs to go to @LOCATION1 when you can just look up pictures of @LOCATION1. It's taking away thrills poeple used to have of going places getting out of the house seeing parts of the world far away first hand instead of through computer. Third, there are for less interactions personaly between well everyone. Kids that text, @CAPS2, or facebook chat more then talk in person with friends are loosing talking skills of actually having a conversation. Because online you have time to think then when you talk in person you have nothing to say because you can'@CAPS1 think and your not to your full talking potential. People are seeing eachother less and less now that they can text and talk over the computer they think now have no need to see eachother now and it is ok just to talk through the internet. Friends & family start to know who you are less because you can'@CAPS1 see emotion through a computer. Also, they say that you can learn more about someone in @NUM1 minutes of playing with them then in @NUM1 minutes of talking with them. With that being the case friends make friends now without even knowing that person with full understanding. Lastly, computers are doing more then good to everyone and they are becoming more and more unhealthy. With people getting less exercise, not enjoying nature as much and having less interactions people are just wasting their time infront of a computer screen getting fat rather then going outside with people and just passing a baseball. There are so many better ways people could spend their time than infront of a computer. Why don'@CAPS1 they see that?",10
875,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 minute of the day - millions of computer users around the world hop onto their laptops or desktops, but is it always a good thing? The question has been raised if people spending alot of time on computers is a bad thing. Computers are a bad thing because people spend too much time on them and lose quility time with friends and family. The dangers of online interaction, and the risk of having your information stolen. Countless people around the world face these problems everyday and computer usage should be lessened. Whether teens, kids, or adults are gaming, on websites or typing essays people around the world spend way too much time on their computers. For example, of the @PERCENT1 of people who have computers with online access @PERCENT2 of them spend @NUM1 hours a day on them. This is about @NUM2 billion hours of computer usage around the world. Children and adults alike have lost face time or interraction with other human beings face to face. Before computers kids played outside running and playing around. While in present day less than @PERCENT3 of all children get at least one hour of time outside. Computers are not a bad thing, but its is when they are over used they become hurtful to kids health. These facts have not just contributed, but they are almost the cause of obesity in the world. Computer usage needs to be cut down to size if we are to solve these problems. The additon of online chat to computers has not only increased computer usage but doubled it. The invention of @CAPS2, and instant messaging was never meant to be a bad thing, but it sure did turn into one. Online chat allows people to send hatefull and vulgar messages to their enemys without showing their face. In some cases some teens were harrased online so bad they committed suicide. Another bad thing about @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 is that dangerous criminals can hide behind their computers and lure children or teens to a meeting place where they can be kidnapped. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 users of online chat was lured by a criminal to a "" meeting place"" and was kidnapped and never seen against last year. Most of these victims do not return or are found. Although the invention of chat online was meant as quick easy communication it became a horror crime in most cases. Millions even billions of dollars have been stolen by internet hackers. These hackers break the security codes and buy things online using other peoples money. Four out five people admit to having multiple sites with personal information on them and @NUM5 out of those four people have had at least one account hacked. This problem continues to grow and hackers feed off of weak sites. If this problem continues to grow the whole world will be bankrupt. These hackers know who you are, your family, your personal information, and where you live. Internet usage needs to be cut down to sites. If we do not then usage will increase, there will be no chat problems and peoples money will get stolen.",10
876,"Computers, @CAPS1 how far we've come. Computers hold many opertunities for the world and… we don't use any of them. Computers have taken many and left them without excersize. Computers fasinate many and can become very adicting if not used only in moderation. Computers are also attention hogs and take away interaction with family. Imagine seven years of your life sitting in front of a computer. You never get up unless you absolutely need to. You even decide to cut the sports from your life. Now imagine what that does to your body. Even if you ate right, the never excersising part woudl kill you. I remember I was at my cousin @PERSON2's house when she sugested to play the game @CAPS2 fit. If you have never played this before, when you sign in, it does some tests and determines the age of your body. My body was @NUM1 years old. I was a @NUM2 years old in a @NUM1 year old body. All those years gone in front of the computer. I don't want that experience to happen to anouther. Don't make the same mistake as me readers of the @LOCATION1 current. I have a friend name @PERSON1, and she is a computer addict. She would spend days on end on the computer. Sometimes she'd miss school for the computer or come to school just to play on the computer. She'd sometimes get violent when someone tried to pull her away. I hated seeing my friend like this, but mostly I hated how I watched it happen. It started off innocent enough. She enjoyed a certain website on the internet. It would sometimes get scary when she talked to me about it and clearly had played it all night. If you are looking at this story and thinking that would never happen to me, your wrong. I was thinking the same way when I took a look at that website that got her started. Thankfully, I stoped my addiction before it got to serious, but many others like @PERSON1 could and will be absorbed by the computers. Many readers reading this right now, should understand how dangerous and read this is, ""@CAPS3!.... @CAPS3!... I'm talking to you!"" That is the sound of your family members trying to talk to you when your on the computer. It doesn't work, computers are so attention grabbing, you can't even stand to talk to your own family. My mom does this many times a day to grab my attention and ends up calling my cell phone or I.ming me. Thats really just sad. By doing this you also become detatched which is never a good thing. The more and more you ignore your family for the computer the less of a bond you'll have, the less of a life you'll have. Computers truly are amazing, but the loss of excersise is very unhealthy and rapidly happening. Computers can also be dangerous, many people will get addicted. The more you chat on chat room to strangers, the less you will talk to your family. Computers are the devils tools. They will most certainly destroy you, readers. Alway be careful, computers are not as they seem.",12
877,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Even though there are good effects of computers on people, there are also many bad effects. Some of the major bad effects of computers on people are no exercise, you can talk to strangers, and no interaction with family and friends. One of the effects of computers on people is no exersise. One of the most important effect of computers on people is no exersise. Right now many people in the @LOCATION1 are obese because of bad eating and no exersise. One of the problems is that these people don'@CAPS2 get off their computers and couchs to go outside. These people choose to stay indoors and just do nothing except watch @CAPS2.V. and go on the computer. So computers have a big effect on how these people live their lives. Another problem caused by computers is kids talking to strangers. Most kids in the @LOCATION1 are a member of a social network like @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. There are people out there that go on these websites on their computers and pretend to be a teen. This can get many kids in trouble if they are not careful on these websites. Since most people access these websites from their computers its another bad effect of computers on people. Another bad effect is no iteraction with family or friends. When people are on computers, they focus on whats on the computer and not about their surroundings. Being on the computer stops many people from interacting with their family and friends. Not interacting with anyone causes their social skills to weaken since they are always on the computer. This can become a serious problem if a person becomes too adicted to the computer. This can cause many problems between communication throughout the family making the family weaken. In conclusion even though there are good effects of computers on people, there are also many bad effects which can cause serious problems. Computers can cause tragaties in families and/or in that persons's life.",8
878,"Dear local newspaper @CAPS1, I do agree that exercising,. I think that people exercising more, and spend time with family and friends. The issue to with is should more people sometime on their less time, exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends should it be the other way around. The first reason why I think that people should spend more time exercising than on their computers is because I think that more to watch and watch the way they eat and keep that self fit because what responsible to see their kid eat and then out exercising and then then self. My second reason is I think that people should time enjoying nature then computer The reason I think this id because they would never would never know what going on computer. How can you never things do. My third reason is interacting with friends and family I think that people should friends and family then on the computer because interacting with friends and family you learn things that you never knew about then and you can places you never gonna be sure discover new things you never your life. For example over vacation I did things and things about my family and friends than I never know why because I people interacting I learned how fun they really are and intering and happy. Have fun where is the computer. Please don't your life live your life. It's now or never should 'people spend more time on or more time exercising. interacting with family and friends.",8
879,"Dear Newspaper, I think people should use computers for spicific reasons. One reason is that many people lose family or to be more spicific lose contact with people. Then when you have a computer for someone else has one then you would be able to see them. For other purposes like wanting to play online with fellow student or friends then you have to use computers. Plus your fingers get a exercise when your typing. Many of us young kids say that myspace and facebook is a bad place. Actually its not because most of your family is on it. Doctors use computers all the time to notife other doctors that something wrong with a patient or give a visual of the bereathing. Workers even use it to see whats going on with the jobs if theres any jobs open so they can take it. Students use it to show what work they have to do when the teachers not there. If i was a capenter of a real estate agent I would have a computer with me. The reason why is that my group would know what houses are avalable to use or thats sold. Or I would give them different house to choose from and give them a good deal on it. I would also bring a computer with me for gps so i can know where I am. Many people use computers for different reason. Such as pog, cheatcodes, @CAPS1 cards and other thing. My reason for using this is because my work is important to me. I would do it on the computers if I miss it. That is why you should have computers all the time. You newer know what would happen. In conclusion, This is why computers are very important to have. The reasons are for if somthing happens. To you and you don't have a phone use a computer. Also its beneficial that everyone has thing to do but computers are the best thing to do.",8
880,"I believe computers have a positive effect on people because computers can help people in many ways. You can e-mail friends from across the world, get important information you might need, and also you can do business online. Computers have fasinating things to show and inform. Most people that have computers can use them for e-mailing friends. Sometimes your closest friends are across the country & you want to talk to them. Why not e-mailing them on your computer? It would mean a lot to your friends it you just take time to say hello through e-mail. My second opinion on why using computers are a positive effect on people because. Some middle school through college & the rest of you life need to use computers. Maybe because of some important information they might need for an assignment from a teacher. Not all the time you can find certain things in books. Now a days computers are taking over books. My third opinion for computers is that some people are to ill to go to work so they work online. Even though you are ill you will still be getting paid because you are still working. So women just had a baby & she is using her computer to work online. So she can make money so she can support her femily. In conclusion, my opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people because they are used for e-mailing friends, finding out important information for school purposes or job purposes. My last opinion is that computers are used for working online. To me, I think computers are a positive effect on people.",8
881,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 out of ten people spend their time on the computers. I believe people should not spend @CAPS3 much time on their computers because it can hurt their eyes. They @MONTH1 watch inappropriate videos or pictures. Lastly, their bills will get higher. Did you know a lot of people spend their time on the computers? Well I think they should not be sitting on their damage their eyes. When you sit and watch computer your eyes starts to hurt. Then when you go to check your eyes, the doctor will probably give a glasses. My second reason is that people go to inappropriate sites and watch inappropriate videos. One time my friend was sitting in the computer and she started to watch inappropriate videos @CAPS3 when her father found out about this, he canceled their internet. Can you imagine the high bills you would get? Why pay too much money for spending @CAPS3 much time in the computer, when you can turn off the computer and spend some time with your friends. For example, instead of sitting on the computer @CAPS3 much, go outside and play soccer, kickball and more. In conclusion, people should stop spendinding @CAPS3 much time on the computers. Computers can hurt your eyes if you sit too much. People @MONTH1 watch inappropriate videos. Also your bills will get higher. It seems to me that people need different activities to get them off the computers. I hope you are agree with my ideas. ",8
882,"@ORGANIZATION1, I believe that we should tell the people of @LOCATION1 about the dangers of using computers too much. For example people who use the computer constently spend less time doing anything else in general. Also the longer you stay on the more you use it, and this habit forms a addiction, which might be hard to break. Finally people who always play video games on computers begin to lose terms of reality. Computers are turning this nation into a bunch of mindless slothes. If you have children, what do you think they do most of their lives. Maybe their going outside and getting exercise, or their brains could be getting sucked into a computer screen. Most kids by the age of @NUM1 have already used a computer for over @NUM2 hour. This shows that kids spend more time using the computer then anything else. I had a friend named @CAPS1 who used the computer @NUM3 and eventually he was so weak and scrawny from lack of exercise that you could snap his arm like a twig. Please, if you don't want your kids to be like @CAPS1, tell them to get up and go play outside. You probably think that using your computer everyday couldn't form an addiction, but computers can be as addictive as drugs. Scientest have found that using the computer everyday for one hour can be enough to form a addiction. In fact if we could scan people to find addiction @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION2 population would be addicted to computers. This means that @NUM4 years from now the world addiction to computers could be at @PERCENT2 or greater. Do you want to live in a world where almost everyone uses their computers @NUM3, I don't. Video games are one of the greatest advances in computer technology but also one of the deadliest. If you have a computer you will have video games. Small dosages can be fine, but non-stop playing can lead to serious problems. Because of the fantesy content people might start to lose sight of reality. For example, scientest tested a video game on kids, and now @PERCENT1 believe in zombies. Now they cannot ever play the game for it might cause serious brain damage. Just to make sure you get my point, let us recap. More computer means lack of exercise and social interaction, you can easily be addicted, and you can lose your sense of realness. I that you don't want to see you or your kids brillant brains turned to mush by computers.",9
883,"Dear @CAPS1, Technology has made great improvements in the past years. Computers have now found a home in all most every buisness and home in @LOCATION1! Everyone thinks computers are so wonderful and can only positively affect you. But do they really consider both sides? Most likely not.. That is why I am here. Computers discourage exercise cut down the number @ORGANIZATION1 hours spent bonding with your family and are a waste @ORGANIZATION1 money and space. I believe computers should be re-examined and peole should stop depending on them so much. Which country has more than @NUM1 million fast food, restaurants currently functioning? Name the fatest country in the world. Who spends the most on unhealthy food? The answer to all @ORGANIZATION1 those questions is the @LOCATION2. With over @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 the population being obese, something needs to be changed. According to studies done by the @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS2), @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people spend over @NUM2 hours a day on the computer. @ORGANIZATION1 those @PERCENT2, @PERCENT3 are over weight or obese. There is an obvious pattern. Exercising makes your muscles stronger, improves lung function and helps burn off unnessecary calories. People most definately need to get off the computer and exercise more. They might even like it. Spending time with your family can be great fun, as I recently discovered. Playing outdoors in team games brings out your competitive side, while board games challenge your mind. ""@CAPS3 who spend time with their family are @PERCENT4 more likely to do better in school,"" @CAPS4 @PERSON2 beyond. So what's stopping them?, Computers. Kids now find many internet sites online online more interesting than hanging out with family and friends. We need to turn @ORGANIZATION1 the computers, bring out the board games and keep @CAPS5 families together! ""In this economy, people cannot afford to waste money they don't have,"" @CAPS4 economist @PERSON1. And she is absolutely right! But what are @PERCENT5 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS6 wasting money on? You guessed it; computers. The average bill per month is @MONEY2. In a whole year your paying @MONEY1 for something you don't need! Computers also waste space. Along with needing a place to house your monitor, you have to find room to cram a printer, the hardrive AND all those wires. Who can find enough room?! I certainly can't. Although technology, namely computers, can be a wonderful thing, we need to look at the downside. @CAPS6 continue to gain weight, families fall apart and the economy collapses, all because @ORGANIZATION1 computers. We need to stop the problems and turn off the computers.",10
884,"You say that computers are bad on todays society? @CAPS1 I'm here to prove you wrong and tell you that they can actually benefit todays society. Maybe some kids don't have phones, so they can go log onto facebook and do everything a phone has to offer and more. School. School. School; so many homework assignments and projects are assigned, and using computer programs help alot and give that proffesional touch. And how coud you forget 'google' the most famous online system, that everyone loves you can do just about anything with that page. So computers bad for society, think again and listen closely. blc computers have just benifited us more than ever. www.facebook.com, that is one of the most visited pages on the internet for all different ages, it deffinetly benefits you. Logging on and seeing your friends profile's newest updates on pictures, videos and life, you get every little detail using facebook. And I you don't have a phone, no. wornes, facebook has a chat system, so you and friends and relatives can talk, or maybe theirs a family party comingup you can get inboxed on all the information, and visit the relatives homepage and see how theyve been doing. @CAPS3 you haven't logged into facebook yet, you deffinetly will now! ""This project will be done on the computer,"" how many times do you hear a teacher says that, almost everytime youre given an assignement! @CAPS1 windows and @ORGANIZATION1 programs will really benefit you in your need for school help. Lets say you've been assigned a project to create a product commerical in computer class, you can hop right onto windows movie maker and get all the help you need, and you'll have the ability to create you project right on the program so it looks and sounds professional. One program you can always use throughout life for presentation is 'power ', In my history class we were assigned a famous person from the @DATE1's and were to do a presentation; @CAPS1 when I got my assignment I went right to powerpoint and got a great grade! lastly the known, @ORGANIZATION1 word! used for all kinds of projects or homeworks and espically writing papers or short stories, having spell check, youre garenteed a good grade! Google! Everyone knows it and everyone loves it. This web hit canbe used for just about anything. From searching pictures and information for a school projects, watching videos of songs, friends, or tv shows that you love or wonna check up on. to looking at websites. Some say the @CAPS2 holds people from exersising, but google can shows you videos of special work outs or websites on healthy eating or an on exercise group or fitness club, so now you see the internet benefits us tremendously! ""Have you change your mind? have you listened closely?"" @CAPS3 so your life just become a whole lot easier, by using facebook, for social ability, @ORGANIZATION1 and windows programs for school, and google for life and health, you have just benefitted from my writing and from using modern technology, the computer!",11
885,"Dear @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2, local paper @CAPS2 @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2 edioter of local @CAPS4 paper. I'm writing a letter to tell you about the effect of computer on people in a society. I think that computers help society learn and helps people to talks to others around the world. Computer help society learn about faraway areas of the world, to learn about the history of an area, and to study animals and habits unable to reach with out travel. Computer make @CAPS14 easier to learn about area that are hard to research like @PERSON1 and cliff of the @CAPS5 in @LOCATION1, @CAPS6 to learn about history of an area or cities of ancient @CAPS7 like @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION2 of @CAPS5. Help study animals species and the habits they could home like the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 or the hasin in @CAPS9 or the species call the @CAPS12 @CAPS13. Computer help society learn about all this. Computer also help people talk to other around world like you can hold a confeti on you computer when you are home, @CAPS14 is easier to talk and ask questin with others as you are on vacation, and you don't have to pay to travel to a place to have a confess with others. You can hold a confess on your computer from home when you can't make to @CAPS14. @CAPS14's easier to talk and ask question about something important to your business. You can go on your computer and talk with other people without spending money to travel there. This how computer help people talk with others around the world. This how computers help socity learn and talk to other around the world. @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2 edioter of local newspaper.",8
886,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The use of advanced computers have increased. You don't see kids outside as often. On the news, you hear about obesity. And you hear the crime rates go up. This does not benefit the socierty. Computers has a negative effect on people. Does your neighborhood seem to be locking children? It's not because their dead! They are now always inside on their computer. I know a thirteen year old named @ORGANIZATION1. She even admits that being on a computer is better than being outside with friends. Meeting people over technology, especially for miners, is a huge risk. You don't know the person. Soon, you would have no friends when it comes to being in the social life. You'd be the outsider. For @PERSON3, her family doesn't even know who she is anymore. Do you want your child to be the outsider? Being on a computer all the time is like being at a fastfood restaurant. You don't exercise, all you do is eat andt talk, but now all you do is eat and on the computer. I have met a obese child. @PERSON2. He weighs three-hundred pounds at the age fourteen. An eight grader, can you believe that? He tells me he has his laptop on his lap, surrounder by junk food. He never exercises or take a break. His report card is unbelievable. He used to be A @CAPS3 student. Now he's in a dump. @PERSON2 does not listen to his mom at all. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION2's, mom says ""he locks himself in his room, goes straight to his laptop, and starts eating. You can even hear him munching the junkfood."" And we wonder why our kids are getting obese there days. It used to be about jobs, but now it's about who you meet on a computer. Myspace, facebook, twitter, you name it, is how the crime rates are increasing now. The people behind these pictures and profiles @MONTH1 not be who you think they are. Especially, miners who lie about their age. They're the ones who fall for those perverted old men. That is one way our sex offenders get a way around. They can use someone's name and be underover. They tell these young girls to meet them places and that's how our young girls, and boys, gets kidnapped, rapped, and end-up killed. A computer holds millions of ways criminals can commit a crime. Do you want your child to be next? Computers these days, are used in the wrong ways, by the wrong people. Kids are never outside again. They are getting obese. And it's a way they get kidnapped. Don't allow this. Get your child(ren) away from their laptops now! Go on a family vacation, somewhere fun. And don't let these sick-minded people get to you or your kids. Take action now!",10
887,"Technology, such as computers are very big. I belive computers have a good effect on people. People that use computers mostly use it to connet with family do research, or to be neat and not write it on paper. I belive that people who don’t think computer make a good effect on people shouldn't bother wasting their time using one. @PERCENT1 of people only use computer to connect with family. Usually your family either lives far away or in another state and you dont get to see them very often. Thats why I think video chating on the computer is a good thing. Also is a family come up you could @CAPS1-mail @CAPS2 your family members instead of calling them because they would talk to you forever. Lastley if you use myspace, facebook or twitter you could connect with old friends and not just family members. ""@CAPS2 my teachers enjoy it when I use the computer to do my work, they said its alot neater"" said @CAPS3 romano from strong middle school. Teachers perfer it when you use the computers to do your work. When you are writing a book report or you are writing a story, you would want to use,icrosoft word of something to write out your paper so it is easer for teachers to read. Also if your in science class and you need to make the chart you would want to use exal to make the chart or graph look more professional. Lastly is you wanted to do a presintation on bloody @DATE1 or little @CAPS4 nine you would want to use a power point instaed of just reading from note cards. If people didn't have google or yahoo they wouldn't know what to do, computers are very good for research. If a student to do a presentation on something they would want to know more about it and look,the topic up. Also if your family was having a discusion at dinner and you had no idea what they were talking about you would look it up online, lastly if you just wanted to find lyrics to a song because you and a friend disagreed on something. Once again I belive that computers make a good effect on people, good for connecting with friends and family. Good for being neat and lastly good for reaserching anything!",9
888,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I think that people spend way too much time on the computer these days. They get less exercise. Don't get to enjoy the nature around them, and they don't get to interact with their family and friends! If people stop spending so much of their day on the computer, then they wouldn't be having too many issues. People need to spend less time on computers, and spending more time exercising! Computers all over the world do not involve much interaction with any part of your body other than your hands. You don't tend to want to get up or do anything else when you're on your computer, right? Well that needs to change. Often, peolple get cranky while they are using a computer or if they need to get off of one. Some people are so obsessed, they might even break down and have a fit! Nobody want's to see someone throw a fit because they have to get off the computer do they? If they don't get exercise anytime when you're not on a computer it can deffinately shows. Jimmy @CAPS2 syas, ""@CAPS3 @NUM1 kids are on their computers way to much! They never come out of their rooms, and if they ever do, then they are normally very cranky. They're getting fat! I can tell because all they eat is junk food. This needs to "" @CAPS4 can't even have a little of time with his children. They should go on a family trip and enjoy together! That brings us in next issue. We all need to enjoy nature more. Why would you spend your time on a computer looking of pictures of nature when you have it right there in your . It's because kids are too lazy to get off their lazy and go outisde. The best thing about nature is that if you are  about need to be alone or even just need to get , nature is always there for you anytime you need it. You can laways go otside with your friends and family too!. I'm sure that they would apreciate people getting off their computers to spend some quality time together. Yet again, our next and final issue. Computer obsessed teenagers and adults need to be with their family and friends. When talking to your friends why bother talking to them on the computer when you can just get together and go do something fun? ALso, when you spend time with your family, it brings them a lot closer toy ou. Nobody likes to not talk to the people you love and the people who reised you. When you're on a computer I just think of all the places you could , place you could be with. Nobody wants to be distant from their friends and family. Therefore, people should turn off their computers, go exercise, be around nature and have some quality time with their friends and family. Thank you",10
889,"Dear @CAPS1, don't you think that nature is better than spending way too much time in the computer? Well, generally speaking, I think it is and i'll give you only three reasons why. First of all, it's about the obesity percentage in @LOCATION1. Second, you can spend a lot more time with your family. Finally, you can enjoy what nature has to offer. I think that the great outdoors is the way to go because @LOCATION1 needs some exercise rather than spending time in the computer. Also because the obesity percentage rate is advancing up really high. In @DATE1, @PERCENT1 are obese or overweighted. Last year in @DATE2, it was @PERCENT2. Wow, the rate went went up like @PERCENT3 in each year. This info was online at www.tomatotalks.org. Another thing I would like to consider, spending more time with a family or even a friend is a good thing. All statistics show that spending time with your family anywhere especially at the dinner table is a great way to talk about your child's problem's in school, and also to learn their parent's mistakes too. Also share great laugh's. Finally the most important thing is what they will do for their future. Last, but not least, you can enjoy the greater outdoors, and also discover some of the most important creatures such as insects, reptiles, and mammals. These creatures are the most important things in our life to learn about. Also trees that gives us oxygen too. Mother nature has it's great benefits when your career is all about science. Computers are educational but nature is better!",8
890,"Yes, I believe that computers benefits society because you can talk to other people, it helps you learn and lastly compoters are apart of todays technology. First of all, computers have really progressed from the old type writer we used to have. Computers have helped todays life for a few different reasons. With computers, they help us learn or find things we didnt know. For example, if you have a project due on the @LOCATION1, then most likley you're probably not going to know much about it. If you go to the internet then you can find tons of things about it like who and what needs the @ORGANIZATION1 for water, how long the @LOCATION1 is, where its located or anything else abot it. Also, another reason why computers help us learn is that, say your going to a new job interview and you have no idea where it is or how even to get there. If you type in the adress and the internet will give you directions. Even if you dont know when your favorite to show is on tonight just type that in and the answer will be right in front of you. Secondly, why I believe that computers do benefits society is you can talk to other people from across the state, country, or world, or even just down the street. Facebook and @CAPS1 are very helpful as well, because one of my best friends moved away in second grade. Just before about christmas i found her on facebook and now we talk and catch up because we havent seen each other in years, @CAPS2 alone tak to her. Another reason why is that if someones mon or dad is away at war or oversea's then the kids and parents could talk to them by using email, skype, yahoo instant messenger, with the webcam or the telephone just @CAPS2 alone just typing back and fourth. You could also just use it for a job buisness to talk to your co-worker or one of your workers on webcam to see things are going with profit, stores, etc. Lastly, why I think computers actually do help us is technollogy has come a long way. For example if you had to type something up you would of have to used a type writer and those things are hard to use. Today you just have to go onto @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and type it out. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 also has spell check, you could email it to someone, or even change the font, color, size of the font and much more. Another reason why is with iphones or i touches now you dont have to be at home you could take out either one and just use the internet for whatever you want to. To find an app, find how long the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 is, or even just to order a pizza but technollogy has come a long way. So this is why I agree with that computers help benefit our society because you can talk to other people, it helps you learn new things you didnt knew before and finally computers have changed a lot and they are apart of our technology. ",11
891,"Dear newspaper, I heard you were discussing if more and more people using computers was a benefit to society. I believe that @CAPS4 has a negative affect on people. They get to interact with people who arent safe, they spend less time exercising and they get into more trouble thean before. Spending more time, online in chat rooms causes people to meet preditors. Take my friend @PERSON5 she was online one day when a man started to talk to her. She thought he seemed acceptable when he said he was @NUM1 and a model. She flirted with him on and on, day after day until one day her friend logged on and found out the man was really @NUM2 and a pervert. @PERSON5 @CAPS1 the only on that this has happened to @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people in chat rooms say they have been lied to like this. Website designer @PERSON2 say, ""More and more people everyday are falling for lies over the @CAPS5 and getting in sticky situations like getting asked to meet the person."" @CAPS1 the saying ""@CAPS2 talk to strangers?"" Spending all your time sitting down on the computer means less time outside exercising. At triputs, this girl @PERSON4 wasnt in shape enough to stay up with the players. Instead of being our practicing like the rest of us, she was in her house talking on facebook. She wasnt prepared when @CAPS4 came, time to show what you had so she didnt make the softball team. The next year she made captain because she was out training everyday before the big day. She's not the only one with a laziness problem. @NUM5 out of every @NUM6 americans are couch potatoes and choose to go online than to stay in shape. Nutritionalist, @PERSON1 says, ""This generation is worse than the last. They complain when they cant do something but thats because instead of going outside, they're on their butts watching @CAPS3 or online."" @CAPS4's a breath of fresh air, what do you have to loose? Kids seem to get in alot more trouble online then they ever have on the streets. They're out posting threats, dissing each other, sending personal messages or pictures and worst of all sometimes hurting someone so bad they commit suicide one year. The neighbor was more popular than this lady's daughter so she created this person online that the neighbor fell for. The online ""guy"" began trashing the teenage girl so bad she ended up hanging herself. People, including singer @ORGANIZATION1 have been caught in sexting. @CAPS4's embarrasing, innappropriate and against the law yet @CAPS4 still happens. These people are not alone. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people have gotten in big trouble through the @CAPS5. Governer, @PERSON3 says, ""@CAPS5 and phones are destroying this society. Theres too much real life drama already."" @CAPS6't you see something wrong with all of this? My opinion on @CAPS4 all is that we should use the computers less before we all start interacting with people that will scare us, become couch potatoes, and get into huge trouble. @CAPS4's really not worth the damage of getting scared, hurt, lazy, or taking your own life.",11
892,"Let's go back around @NUM1 years ago. Those were days when it could take weeks to communicate with out of state family. Days when knowledge was only found in books, and ofen found slowly. Those were days where everything was done with a lack of speed and precision. Computers change all that. With nothing but the tap of a finger, we can communicate with people worldwide, or sea the web for some knew information. @PERCENT1 of people's relatives live out of their state. I can relate, with @NUM2 cousins in @LOCATION2 and @NUM2 in @LOCATION1. Without these instant messages and emails, we would more than likely talk to them once, maybe twice a year! Some people say that computers make people spend less time interacting with family and friends. For me personally, and I know many others, interaction would be impossible without these modern manuals. With all the @LOCATION1 technology out there. Nothing has me as amazed as the webcam. You, with this tool, can talk face to face with someone on the other side of the world! The world is a better place when we can have a true connection to other cultures, and what better way than to talk to them. What people @NUM4 years ago would never think possible, we can use at a moments notice, and yet still, many people don't appreciate it. My @CAPS1 and my @CAPS2 have both used internet to reunite with old college buddies, or see how far away friends are. These are grown ups, using the tools available to improve their lives. Internet goes beyond teenagers on @CAPS3 and @CAPS4. What you can find online still amazes me. The information you could get out of @NUM2 non-function books, you could find in turn minutes on the internet. Any question, including personal, anything, can be answered. Years ago people would have killed for this power, for the common man to be able to access all he ever needed to. I see the point people make about needing excersize and they're right. But in five minutes on the web you could have an exersize routine planned out, with modern techniques and styles. The computer has anything for anyone. Looking for some place to enjoy nature & @ORGANIZATION1 it. In seconds there will be thousands thousands of results. Missing a dictionary? There are literaly hundreds of sites to find a definition online. People take these machines for granted and assume we could live without them, but I doubt they ever realize how much we really need them. The technology is there. Why not use it? I could never turn down an opportunity to talk to a distant cousin, or another kid from a different country. I couldn't pass up a chance to check up on some old buddies that moved away. Thanks to computers, I have that opportunity. I have that chance. I've been shown an open door to find out everything I could want. Man can't know everything. But these days, he can find out anything. I'm not sure if the omputer has changed the direction of advancing technology, but I can tell you, it has definitly offered the course.",10
893,"Although many people love to be on computer palying video games and have cyber chats, most of them don't know how bad a computer can be even though I experience a great time on the computer, I know how bad it is. Here is a short example. You can experience problems with your computer, if you stay on the computer for to long it can over heat and that can cause it to stop working. Another problem is side effects. you can get headaches from just staring at the screen for to long. Those headaches over time can become even worst. You @MONTH1 even get poor vision from a computer. Computers can also be addicting. Because of your addictition with computers you @MONTH1 become less close with family or friends, causing your social life to be very minimal. Also, because of the addiction, it @MONTH1 work its way to your daily routines causing you to have to play it daily and more thatn the average person does.

On a computere your child will probally be shown things like words to pornographic features. These are all things that should not be allowed to access on a computer.

895,"Dear local newspaper, I think computers are used way to much in this society! People spend more hours sitting the computer than exercising because people find it more thrilling spending more time with computers than trreadmills! People in this society think we are spending to much time on the computers, while others don't realize how long they've been staring at a screen for! I am one of those people who like using the computer a lot but I have relized changes.

I never really thought about how much I don't talk to them anymore because I'm to busy cyberly chatting with friends. Although, I don't think we should get the computer either. Online we can research almost everything in the world. I can even type my name in a research bar and find me and anybody else with the excel same name as me! The internet got for more technical in the past years. Without it, these days, just about everybody would be lost! The internet should be used less on blogging and chatting, and should be used more on things more useful like @CAPS1.com or @CAPS2.com. I hope you consider this.",7

My three topic's are they teach hand-eye coordination give people the ability to learn, and allow the people to communites. First, the computer's are'nt just for talking about! It gives them to learn hand-eye . If people were to belive that computers are just for fun. They would teach you how to type and take some lesson on typing without looking on the keyboard.

If theres a school closing a delay you don't know that you would like to get as a . people the ability is check-out on what's going on around the world or checking for the weather. These are my reason why i truly belive that people should be online atleast twice a week.",7
897,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 are several reason how computers have effect on people. My position is to convice the local newspaper why certain people @CAPS2't and @CAPS3 use computers. People getting caught up on the @CAPS4, or people not having enough money to explore the world, so they just be on the @CAPS4. In effect, people @CAPS2't waste their time on the @CAPS4 because you will get caught up. For example, my friend @PERSON1 stay on the computer more than @NUM1 hours. He tells me that his on a @CAPS5 line, hooking up with other people. He for gets about everybody. He's so on the @CAPS4. He stop going school, he gaining. Now he just a nobody. He just sit in front of his computer and do nothing. I feel like he just threw his life away just for some stupid @CAPS5 line. @CAPS8's not hard to find another in our city. @CAPS8's alot of beautiful young lady's out here to explore. Similary, people @CAPS2't waste their time on the @CAPS4 because you start losing time. For instance, you spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. People stop losing their focus on important, and start paying attention on other things like the, was a great person. She was so successful. She make tons of money. Until she start losing her her job. She stop cause she was so stock on facebook. Facebook is like a place for a friend @CAPS6 you could meet other people from different @CAPS7 you could just find people to date on that website. Facebook turn her life around. I remember her telling my mom how her life is so mess up now. How she got fired, how she don't pay her bill, and how she moving into a. Sometimes websites make lose focus on important thing in life. Consequently, certain people @CAPS3 use computer because the @CAPS4 help you with certain things. In summation, @CAPS8 help you find hotel or trip to go on with your friends or families. I love being on the @CAPS4. One time I sign up for this website that was called myspace. For moment I did got caught up on @CAPS8. Continue line.",9
898,"To whomever this @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 your life without a laptop or a desktop computer. It would be hectic right? How will you keep up with your email or type of the articles for this very newspaper? Even though some people @MONTH1 believe that computers are taking away from exercise, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends, computers do have a positive effect on us. The list of reasons why is endless but three that stand out are you can communicate with people in other states or countries, it's more interesting to learn from a website than a textbook, and eventually @CAPS2 will be computerized anyway. Am I right? Have your old teachers ever assigned you a pen pal in another state or country? If yes, didn't you have to, write letters? Then, you had to wait at least @NUM1 weeks before your pen pal wrote back. If you had used computers, you would've gotten a response back within days. I know many parents and other adults @MONTH1 think that e-mails are a waste of energy but actually they're faster than letters will ever be. Has your daughter or son ever told you that reading from a textbook is boring? Yes? No? That's where computers come in. It's much more interesting to use the internet than reading from a book. I understand that some students can read from a book and retain all of the facts that they've learned from that one book but various students learn differently than that. If a student learns from the internet, they're more likely to remember it because they won't be put to sleep by the boredom of a textbook. Many people have mentioned and some statistics show that by at least @DATE1, @CAPS2 will be computerized. Do you seriously want to be the last one left behind? I wouldn't I understand that you are a person who likes to keep up with the current events so why not use your computer more often? When they say @CAPS2, they mean @CAPS2. They even have @CAPS3 tools on computer. So I want you to take a survey of how many people find computers effective and you'll be surprised. Many people will say the same that I've said. The choice is yours, which side are you on? Thank you.",10
899,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers are a great invention! They allow you to do so many different things. They have alot of positive effects on people. Computers deal with all sorts of things, from hand-eye cordination, learning about faraway places and people, to talking online with anyone. Come on in to the wonderful world of computers. Computers have a super positive effect on people. They help teach hand eye cordination. You can look at the screen without having to look down at your hand to move the mouse. You can see where it's going just by looking at the screen. Doing this helps everyday skills like playing sports. If you can use your eyes and your hands at a you can hit a baseball or even.

And my last reson is it give you hand-eye coordination @CAPS3't you sick of haveng to go to the book stor and find a book to do a project? well now with the computers you don't have to.

901,Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: Computers have a negitive affect on people and their to connect with others because they always are on the computer and never outside. My first reason is that computers hurt your eyes after a long time sitting at them. People I know have complained of their eyes hurting after using the computer. Studys show taht @PERCENT1 of all people who use the computer after a long time are more likly to loose their eye sight than people who are outside all day. Another one of my reasons is people who are inside on electronics all day are less likly to have good people skills. If you don't have good people skills then you probibly wont have alot of friends and if you need them it would probibly be over the computer. And you never know what they could be like. Also if your inside all day then you will not get the proper excersize could be very bad you and others. My third and final reason is that people will makes fun of you if you sit inside all day don't come out because your on the computer. If you ar on the computer you are more likly to fail in school you don't do your homework or projects but instead your on the computer playing games. And your more likly to get into fights with your parents or guardians because your on the computer and they never see you or hear from you. Also they wont be able to go online and pay their bills witch could be bad for everyone. So these are just some of the reasons I think computers could be bad. Thank you.,8
902,"In my own opinion I think that people should get less time on computers more time exercising, enjoying, nature, and interacting with family and friends. If people spend time on computers they will not get off and be stuck on computers then spending time like going to the park, or the mall. For my second opinion that people should not get off of computers because it they ever leave somewhere far they are not to be able to contact you. If you on the computer you could get a computer that say's a free labtop then you could take it far like: On a airplane to north carolina, or virginia, or wasington @ORGANIZATION1, or a party, or a road trip, or on a ferry boat to the long island sound. For my third opinion that I agree people should not be off of computer because they might plan a trip to a far away place or a new house, or planing a anerveriry, or a new spot for a hunny moon a gorgest place like ona peek hill or at a hotel with a bed shape like a heart. For my fourth paragraph that I agree that people should not be off of computers that the count a location than person house or a location where they might be for that particular spot where that person is. For the fifth paragraph that I agree that people should not be able to get off of computers. I tell you why planning a birthday party for there child, or going to someone house for a visit like to tennessee. Or going to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to see a basketball team and @CAPS1.S a another team and they are call @CAPS2 @CAPS3 lakers us caverlars. My conclusion is that people should not to be able to get off of computer.",7
903,"Dear Newspaper, I believe comuputer have made a great effect on people in society. I believe this because they make you smarter, they help with entertainment needs, they also give you the option to socialize with websites, and online chatting. theese are things people need in every da life and heres now. One reason why I believe computers benefitt people in society, is with the simple fact that computers teach you things. I mean sure you can pick up a book, but why? with a computer you can quickly, and easily type in what you need to know and within seconeds you have @NUM1 million sites that can tell you what you need to know. Computers can also show you places that you've always wanted to see and learn about, the computer can tell you an exact location and information about the area. I know your thinking to yourself. ""wow how cool!!"" but that nothing wait untill you hear what else i have to say! Computers can give you instructions on how to build stuff, step by step instruction to create a work of art. My seconed reason is computers can give you entertainment like playing games, watching movies, and tv shows you missed because you were at work or doing something important. My last reason why computers benefit society is with entertainment, you can make friends or chat with the ones you have, with websites like facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, ect. Making friends or keeping up with the ones you have in a positive way help fight depression. If your always happy on the computer. Therefore you'll have nothing to be depressed about. Also if you have any questions at all that you have wondering in your @CAPS3 ask the computer and it will awnser your questions throughly, and leave you satisfied with an awnser. As you can see computers can do many great things, and what I said is only a few things computers are capible of just watch, computers will be apart of our lives more and more and if you can't use one you @MONTH1 have a hard time. please if you have a different opinion consider my decisons. Thank you for your time.",8
904,"Dear fellow citizens, @CAPS1 think if you had to get a book for every question you had. That would take a long time to even get the book let alone read it. Computers have helped the modern world with questions, long distance friends, and entertainment. Computers have helped us with more then those things the @CAPS2 is sucha universal thing that its hard to come up with all of the helpful things it does. For one the @CAPS2 helps us stay in contact with our friends that are far away without talking on the phone with them. Sites like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 allow us to communicate and/or play with them. @CAPS1 think is the only way to talk with a friend from a different place would be to pick up the phone and call them well your friendship would disappear very quickly. This would happen because no one ever usualy has the time to pick up the phone and talk to the person and do nothing else. Well when you talk to them on the @CAPS2 you can do other things. For example if I wanted to I could talk to someone and the @CAPS2 and clean my room. Further more computers allow us to play games or watch funny videos or any else that is entertaining. On the to do I when my brother would let me use the play again. I was but them I @CAPS1 went better A also play movies, @CAPS5 shows videos. If you ever miss a show to watched home of the show and watch it. This could save someone time and effort. Lastly, The computers much more efficient is looking yet things. IT is much faster then looking through the library and you don't have leave your I although people say that the @CAPS2 is taking away time from reading well it really isn't it. For everything you want you can read online or if you really want to you can have the @CAPS2 don't for you. Reading isn't a problem at all. @NUM1 of america believes that computers help greatly and how they have more time to do things is being upgraded every day and it keeps getting better and better. In conclusion I believe that computers are helping us and is not a bad thing. Computers are great for us and good for bussy people. Now go and get a @CAPS2 to.",10
905,"Dear local newspaper, I have some arguments to tell you how computers aren't all bad. One you can use them to get information for a project, talk to your friends, or learn about something you have never known before. My first argument is that most people use there computer to get information for a project they have to do for class. For example, they could need information for a country like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. There are many way you can get this information. So if you didn't have a computer where could you get all this information. If you get it from a it might not have what you are looking for your project. Had the computer here a bigger range of knowledge then a have. My second example, is you can talk to your friends you haven't seen or talked to in a long time. There are many ways you can do this On @CAPS1, @CAPS2, twitter, yahoo. You could always because it is always better to make new friends. Even better to a family member. I know it is alot better to talk to a family because they already know you. Finally, it is always better out something you never knew before or something you have been wondering about. But you could always go on google, ask or wikipedia. They can all help you you have been looking for. But that doesn't mean you can't find it in a book either. They are chalk full of answer and ideas that can help you. My conclusion, is that you can always find ways to get the answer you need. But that also doesn't mean that you should be sitting on the computer when you could be going outside, or playing with our friends. And nothing is better then spending your time outside. So use the time on the computer better. Then go out side and enjoy the outdoors.",8
906,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer at home? Right now, more than @PERCENT1 of the people have at least one or more computers at home. Computers are common by now, but people argue rather they are really needed on our society. Computers give negative effects on people, for example, lose eye sight, interacting with strangers online and lack of outdoor exercise. One out of five people wear glasses or contacts, these days. the rate of people wearing glasses are increasing rapidly as well. Children and adults are spending too much time on the computer, which causes to lose eye sight. When people use too much computers, their eyes start to hurt and lead to a headaches as well. These are sign of spending too much time, but people tend to ignore it because they want to get work done, or simply addicted to the online video games. this shows that computers give terrible effects on society. When a person is on the internet, there is no limitation to him or her. Once a person is online, there are endless amounts of site to access on that are not always trusted. Online, where anyone can go on, there are millions of people that are not connected or related. In other words, strangers, interacting with people they don't know is very dangerous. They can have devastating influence, no supremacy, what so ever unless they are a teacher of same sort. Unfortunatly, people can not trust anyone online because they don't know who it exactly is. For example facebook. People think they are private, but everything that is uploaded or posted is public. Also others will be able to view your profile even they are not friends with that person. this is not safe in any way. The rate of people getting addicted on the internet is increasing as well. These people tend to not go outside at all and stay home. These people get not enough exercises, which are very unhealthy they tend to get their meals done at fast foods which are unhealthy as well. For the reason, people on the computers get fat from the unbalanced meal and never interact with people outside and nature outside. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on society because, they increase the number of people wearing glasses and losing eye sight. Second, they are creating a unsafe environment. last it makes people have unbalanced meals and lose track of their diet. ",8
907,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you think that computers have bad effect on people today? I know I don't. Over @PERCENT1 of people today have a computer. On a computer you can find great things about a place and people. If you don't have the best handwriting then you can type it and computer can help you look stuff up. @CAPS1 you want to go and look you your favorite hockey player? Instead of going to the library and hoping that theres a book on him. You can just @ORGANIZATION1 his name and hundreds of different websites using will came. That will save a lot of your day and it will save a lot of you money. If you go on a family trip each year to the sum. Place you need a change? Then you can look up another place online that @MONTH1 has the same features but it @MONTH1 be way closer then going to @LOCATION1 each year. So, if you have a computer then you can look places you @MONTH1 want to travel to or look up cool facts about your future sport player. If you have messy handwriting and its getting harder and harder for your teacher to read then you can just learn how to type it up on the computer. At least @PERCENT2 of students in schools today are getting zero on homewrok or test because their teacher can't read their hand writing. If you type it up on a s computer then you will spelling or grammar as you ever you for sizes and color as pictures are make your grade high to the fact you little more work into you die. So, to all the people who think that computer help anyone well reasons why computer can help someone. Computers can help kids find something or can help them computer can also find video about your favorite player or about you favorite hockey players give warning not the playoffs. You can find all good stuff online. You can find your favorite song for your cellphone. Over @PERCENT3 of people get the song from the computer. Also the computer can play the favorite song on the computer. For example if your favorite band was drop kick murpheys then you can @ORGANIZATION1 that are you will find all of their songs. Alot of people think that computer are not good for us. But, I say they are wrong. You can find info about there future person they can look up there. If you have messy handwriting then you can go and type it up lastly you can songs, video, and much more when you browse the web. For example, @LOCATION2, @MONTH1 be there very own website. Computer can help kids find info better we type your paper sloppy.",9
908,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you ever just wanna go out side and play a game of football with the ones you love? Well I know I @CAPS2. I believe that almost @PERCENT1 of kid are on the computer @NUM1 because they have nothing to @CAPS2 or it is addicting. The reson that I belive in this strongly true stament. That people are consurnet about how much time people spend on the computer and not with ther familys. One important fact about kid being on the comuter is how dangours it can be. Now a days kids don't relize how dangours being online can be for example I rember a time when my cousin said that he went to the movies to meat up with some girl he meat on myspace but all he saw was a, balet hewdet, sex ofender. That told him he was the one talking to him online. That he wanted my cousin to go over his house and play x-box and my cousin screamed hell no and leaft to my house cause the movie theater wher closer to my house. Know being safe is important. Would you rater have your children safe with you or with some stranger? Computer can also be helpful at time when needed for school or you job. Only people would think its fun to home and go on the computer for no reason. Second of an dont you want to spend time with children before they go to college or some thing? Just the littlest thing like playing a game of football will affect them to create a better with you and you chiled. Some thing you can @CAPS2 to get them to go out side with you is take the computer away for a week and have fun with your child. Play some of his/her favorite sports. So with the computer computer. without a bond with you and you chiled. So the time has come to make a let your kid be lazy on the computer and get into or go have fun with them?",8
909,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. You can do lots of stuff with computers such as help people learn new things almost about everything. Also, there are some programs on the computer where they allow you to talk to other people. Also, for adults, they can take care of some finances and bills online and some taxes. I think computers definitely have a positive effect on people. A lot of people use their computers to learn new stuff about other things and people. Nine out of ten people go on the computer at least more than once a month to learn about something new. Also, kids in school use computers all the time for school work and to learn about new things. Kids in school use computers in school all the time for projects and experiments and they learn new stuff about people and things in the world. Computers definitely have a positive effect on people when they learn new things. Another great things about computers is that there are programs that allow you to talk to other people. Eight out of ten people talk to another person almost every day on the computer. This is a good thing because they’re able to talk to friends and family from a long distance and enjoy themselves. It is also a good thing because if family moves away you can still talk to them from a computer. Another positive effect computers have for you is that adults can pay bills and finances on the computer also. Seven out of ten adults pay bills online at their computer. This is a good thing because adults have to do it by hand, now they can just do it on the computer, which is definitely a positive effect on a person! I think computers definitely have a positive affect on people in many ways. They help people learn new stuff about things and. Also, they allow you to talk to friends and family over the internet. And finally, they allow you to do finances and pay the bills online instead of by hand. There are many ways still computers have a positive affect on people, I’ve only stated just a few of them. I hope you take my side about my opinion about computers and that they definitely have a positive affect on people.",8
910,"To whomever this @MONTH1 concern, @ORGANIZATION1, almost everyone has them. Computers can make it easier to find certain places by using search engines such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 they are also a way of communication. I believe people using computers does benifit society because scientists use computers every day, to make the plans to send a ship into space or to keep progress of an experiment. Computers help people stay organized. A lot of teens and kids use their computers to shop and stay in touch with friends. Some people belive people spend to much time on computers. That @MONTH1 be true, but also remember what its doing for society. When people spend less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends its a personal choice. Its not like their being obliged by the @ORGANIZATION1.",6
911,"Computers are great, they can help you with anything you need. You can shop on then, pay bills, even book a flight to go on vacation, but people are spending too much time on them. They should only spend a certain amount of time on them and not all day. Many people are spending more than enough time on the computer People ran often stay on the computer for hours and not even relize it, they stay up all @TIME1 doing work, or playing games. @TIME1 a while it will eventually take a toll on the body. Because @CAPS2 you are on the machine all day then you are using little to no energy at all. So then you spend @CAPS1 nights in bed tossing and turning. Then that leeds to feelings horrible in the @TIME2, @CAPS2 you do it @TIME1 it is going to have a bad effect on your body. I believe that people who spend all their time on the computer will eventually get overweight. @CAPS2 you are sitting in a chair all day then you get no exercise what so ever. Then when you eat you don't burn off the calories so that leeds to people gaining wait and becoming over wait from that your body becomes very unhealthy and will most likely leed to health issues. When people are on the computer they end up ignoring nature. They miss out on being in the wonderful warmth of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, or going out and playing in the snow and making @CAPS5, forts, or having a @CAPS6 fight. They even miss out on just going outside and talking a walk the reason is because they are @CAPS7 @CAPS8 inside their house with their fare glued to the computer. Being on the computer takes a lot out on the body. It can cause health problems and even problems in general. So people should just spend a part of their day on the computer. The other part of the day they should be outside, walking around, maybe playing with pets, children or friends. As long as they're out of there chair and not on the computer and getting some exercise.",9
912,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I do not believe that computers are very beneficial to our society. Computers donot benefit us because they are stoping many people @CAPS3 exercising and healthy life, playing sports, and enjoying the outdoors. Computers are stoping many people, particular the younger generations, @CAPS3 exercising. Now a days instead of bitting the gym many people are home on the computer talking to friends or playing computer games. As a result many people are not as healthy as they should be. It's also recorded that any person who is on the computer for large amounts of times are hurting thier eyes, resulting in an increase of people wearing glasses. If people were to go and start doing things besides the computer they will live a happier, healthier, and better life. Unfortunatly, many young people are not getting in to play sports. During this decade many sports games have come out for the computer. Now instead of pushing themselves to work hard for aspact, kids ethier play with no heart or dont play at all. The reason for this is because they can instead work extremly hard on thier custom @CAPS4 or @ORGANIZATION1 teams in @PERSON2 or @NUM1. Also the computer is not the only electronic stoping kids @CAPS3 playing sports, xbox, playstation, xbox @NUM2, psp, @NUM3, gamecube and gameboy are some of the few console systems that play games that distract kids. I myself, had been caught thinking more about on xbox game then @CAPS2 own hackey game! not olny are these electronics pulling kids in like magnets but the parents are they are alarming thier kids to play video games or stay on the computer for hours on end. Many of us dont know what its truly like to go outside and camp. do not to spend time with thier family. I came @CAPS3 on @CAPS5 family and many @CAPS5 families are very close, so its natural to be doing things with @CAPS2 father or brother or whole or cousin. However not to many families are as close as so they do not do something togther. If some fathers took thier sons fishing or camping, it would get them away @CAPS3 computers and the father/son band will become stronger. These are @CAPS2 reason sir and they should be thought over far quite sometime. Just remember that many people need to exercise, many play sports, and many families got to exprience the outdoors.",8
913,"Wouldn't you like to find a @NUM1-star hotel or resteraunt with a click of a button? I know I would like to. So should we keep using computers for the good of our society, or not use computers to exercise more? Computers are helpful to us by doing work that has to be done neatly. It also helps by accessing and surfing the internet to more useful stuff. A computer is very intelligent and not only can came in a boring, heavy, boxed shape. Computers are also in some electronics. If you go on vacation and forget to turn off the lights, you can use your hand held computer to turn it off. Communication is pretty easy on a computer. All you need is computer (of course), a microphone or headset, some speakers, and a special software. After you have all of these, you can connect with the rest of the world! Talk to loved ones or family members through your computer. If you want, you can also get a web cam. A video camera used on your computer. Then you can see others face to face! If you do not have anything what I just said, there is also texting. Just use your computer keyboard to type and send a message. Your computer can also a lot more things. You can play mindless video games! Your computer must have the right specifications to play it. Sure it might be pricey to",8
914,"@ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of the world say that computers are a good way to interact with people, learn about forgien people and places and also learn about where your family came from. So here I am going to inform you about the good reasons why computers should stay in our society. How do you meet people from different countries? One way is interacting with different people all over the world. I am saying this because the internet has a lot of benifits in meeting people. One way is to make a certain account where you can meet people who aim or a different account. Another way is go on a website where you can pen-pal someone from a different place in the world. The final way is to download something where they can send instant messages to people all over the world. Do you have a project where you to learn about another country or another explorer? Well you can use the computer to learn about the place or the person. I am saying this because that will helps us with all the work we do for school. Computers also help you with your school work by helping you with homework. I am saying this because with nobody home when nobody there when you come home from school who is going to help you with your homework you can use a website that helps you understand the material better. Do you know where your family comes from? A way you can find out with your family come from is use a website to find where your family comes from. For example, @LOCATION1 is a helpful website to learn who they really were in life, were they fight in a war. You can find this all out on the computer. Another way is you can ask your parents the name of someone and type there name in google.com. There are many reasons why we should could keep computers but here are some, interact with people, learn about other places and learn about family. I hope you understand this better.",8
915,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 a world without computers. Where would we get all of our information from? Would we have to religh on television or magaziens, where information can be changed? Or how would we ever get any reports done for work or home work? I know many people who don't write neat, how will any one read it? Basically, computers effect our lives so much in a good way that it would be chaos with out them. Computers allow people to learn how to type which can improve all around skills such as hand eye coordination, they let us connect with places we are not familiar with and see family members, and they allow people to have an online education which can help with the economy. Computers effect us in a very good way and they change our every day lives, @CAPS2 children these days cannot type. A recent study done at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT1 of kids older than @NUM1 already know how to type on a keyboard. Computers have such a big effect on us with so many skills that people don't ignoledge enough. Because all of thoes kids know how to type, they can spell better too. I remember one time when I was in the middle of writing a report online. I got @NUM2 a word I didn't know and had always had trubble spelling it. So I took my time and typed it out one letter at a time, and it was correct! This example shows that computers can effect everyones lifes, even younger kids. The way that we get information from computers is just like the way our hands get information from our brain to move. For example, when babies learn how to walk the religh on their brains show them how it's done. This is just like how when there is a natural disaster, such as the earthquake in @LOCATION1 we religh on our computers to show us and tell us what is going on and how something like this could happen. Computers can effect us this way because there are many things we might never know about our world without them. Computers effect families everyday lives by giving them online educations. My @NUM3 year old cusin told me that she was happy her mom could go back to college from home because then they could spend time together. I know you might think that computers can make families get further apart but they actually bring them closer together. There is only one choice and that is that computers effect all of us in a good way. They can help us learn how to type, connect us with our world and bring families closer together. Without computers we wouldn't be the same as we are today.",9
916,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are a huge thing now adays. Almost everyone has one that they use. But why do some people think that it is hurting our society. This isn't right because you need it for education, people aren't on all day, and a job. So how could those things be harmful to society. Your right they can't. Every single person has had some type of education. But how can you have an education with out a computer. If you rae working and you need to get another degree for your job. You can't go during the day so you can find a school that has online schooling, for at night. That way you don't miss work and you still get your schooling. Another reason why is that a school project or essay. You might need the computer to search up things for a project. Or cite your sorces. What if you need to type an essay what do you do then. No computers no education and you will go and works at @CAPS1 or something. Where you don't need an education. But people aren't on all day so what does that do to society. Nothing at all. Kids and adults go outside and have fun. They go on the computer to check e-mails, play games, look at facebooks/myspaces. But they have enough responcibility to go out and get fresh air. And if they sit in side then it isn't your problem because it is their life and they want to live it their way. Not the way everyone else wants them to. They can make choices for thier self and don't need others, to do it for them. So it really shouldn't effect you at all. What if at you job you need the internet. Most office people have a computer to talk to others by e-mail or to fix problems. People who work at about need the computer to access your account to get your money. People that estimate the cost of a building need it for adding something or keeping a record. The video games are a perfect example because the programers use a computer to porgram what you want to happening the game and thet takes hours to complete. So how are computers harmful to society because I still don't see it. Education, people aren't on all day and a job are really good reason that computers should becept. So everyone I strongly encourage you to reconsider what could happen without computers.",8
917,"I think that the advances of technology to the computer are great and more beneficial than bad. Say you struggle at school and need serious help, you can turn to a computer for help, say you have a dear friends that a week ago moved to florida, you can use the computer to contact them. And finally if you want to learn about the world, great! Google search places to learn about. These are just a few reasons why the computer is helpful as opposed to bad! School one of many students least favorite activities, yet you can use the internet to help you out, @CAPS1! say you are in geometry and it is kicking you're butt, got to @PERSON1 academy for informational videos. Maybe you are a third grade teacher and the little kids are driving you nuts, go to @LOCATION1, and educational and fun website. Maybe you just want to relax and learn, plug in earphones and listen to math help. These are merely a few ways that the internet helps with schooling. What if it is a really rainy rainy day and you are tired and want to learn about faraway places in a logical person's head, the internet pops into their head. Think of the computer as a big easy to acess library, type something into a search engine and it pops up. What if you are in germany and you are hungry, oh no! Everything is in @CAPS2! open your laptop for easy translation. All of these things support that the internet makes learning about foreign places easy. And finally, communication is really easy, with the internet because, there use emails, skypes, chatrooms etc. internet's middle name is communication. What if your phone is gone and there is an emergency, you can get the email! What if a burgalor cuts the phone lines and sneaking your house e-mail @NUM1. And finally internet can be used to call @PERSON2 and tell him, ""don't forget the red bull"" as he leaves. Those are some of the reasons the internet is good for communication. Go let's recap on this paper. Internet is great for communication. Also help with learning about far away places. And finally help with schooling. These are the reasons I think internet is valuable in this day in age. ",8
918,"Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1 you know that over half our nation own home computers? Recently, though, some experts have been concerned whether or not computers benefit society. I have been asked to state my opinion and I believe computers have a positive effect becuase, they are mandatory for work, allow online socialization, and expand traveling. After reading this, I am sure you will agree. Firstly, computers are mandatory to have for work and @ORGANIZATION1. Students keep their essays, study guides, and home work updates on files in the @CAPS5. Offices would not be able to function @CAPS8 computers; workers rely on the internet email system. An interviews with a student from @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""I use my @CAPS5 for everything; I would not survive the workload @CAPS8 @CAPS3."" @CAPS2 asked why, he replied, ""@CAPS3 keeps everything organized, and is an easier way to research topics."" A lawyer said, ""You can not support a client if you don't have the right tools, and a @CAPS5 is on @MONEY1 those tools."" @CAPS4, @CAPS8 computers offices would crumble and students grades would drop. Could you imagine writing a newspaper @CAPS8 a @CAPS5? Secondly internet access allows people to meet new people. Many websites such as '@CAPS6' and '@CAPS7' allow people to reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 the nation owns accounts on socializing websites, and @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 the nation says their friend groups have expanded to the groups (according to a poll taken). A psychologist explains, ""Some people are too shy to meet new friends in person; online bloom."" @CAPS8 internet, citizens @MONEY1 @LOCATION1 would know little about other countries' people. My next reason, however is even greater. Lastly, @CAPS8 internet, people would do for less traveling. Internet allows citizens to research places they would like to visit and buy transportation to their destination. @CAPS3 also is an easy and effective way @MONEY1 booking where the tourist shall stay. Apoll taken by @ORGANIZATION2 airports shows that @PERCENT3 @MONEY1 the travelers book their flights online and @CAPS8 online ticketing 'the wait to book your flights would be unbearabley long; or stop travelers completely' (quote from a worker). My people and I went to various airports and train stations across the country and interviewed @NUM1 people each. We inquired about how the bought their tickets and @PERCENT4 @MONEY1 them said online. ""@CAPS9 do you mean, how? On the internet @MONEY1 course! no one could get anywhere if we stood in lines all day!"" said a person interviewed. Airports make @MONEY1 for the @LOCATION2 government, and @CAPS8 internet less people would travel. There for, computers are mandatory. Computers have a positive effect on owners; since they allow easy organization and research, online socializing and better ways @MONEY1 booking transportation. @CAPS8 computers internet access, our business would crumble, then the economy would follow. I know you agree with me.",12
919,"@ORGANIZATION1, I would like to tell you computers are very helpful in our society today. Have you ever needed to know something about a state or a place that brought up nig news & you needed to get it? Were did you turn to? I know not a book, but to the computer. Without it how were you going to get your info. I think computers are benefitial to our society because it can help you learn and it could tell you when or where to sign up for activities. People interact with others different countries, states, & or continents. Next, is how computer could benefit our society. Computers could help us learn by searching up research for a paper or even expanding our general knowledge. For instance today my class & I are going to the @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1 to look up info on seat belts on buses. Without computers my class & I couldn't have get it done without the computers. If we had books, it wouldn't have been enough to give to us all & that would mean we would have to share. With sharing some kids @MONTH1 have hogged the books for a long time not allowing the other kid to get the info needed to do the paper, which would lead to a civil dispute in the classroom those two. With computers we have enough for each kid in the class. And, computers could help with gaining more general knowledge quicker. With gaining more general knowledge you become smarter. Next, computer can help set up activities. Computers could help go sign up for activities like baseball, football, basketball, or a gym. With the help from the computers you don't waste time going to the gym signing up, while you could do it at home. Maybe there's a waiting list to enter. You would've known that if you signed up online. For instance my little brother plays baseball & my parents signed him up online. All they had to do was to take him to the place to sign up & show that. I live in the town of @LOCATION1, while others had to sihn up, register, & pay. All of that could've been done online like my parents didnt with the understanding of why computers could be helpful to society by being able to gain knowledge & able to sign up for activities. Do you see why we need them for everyday life or just to get around? Computers are benefitial to our new up & coming society!",8
920,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 look at advances in technology over the years and can tell what an influence it has had on current day and people. The question is, are these advances for the better? Or will they take a turn for the worst? Today i will be talking to you about technology, and why i think its benefitting society poorly. With people spending less time excercising and enjoying nature, leaving ther social life behind by constanly being on the computer, they dont realize how much they're hurting themselves. The number of obese people especially in children, increases each day. This is caused by lack of excersize because some people are too busy responding to texts, talking on the phone and playing unneeded video games. Not only are they physically harming themselves, but they are definitley missing out on the wonderful aspects of mother nature! Why not get out for a little, escape the technology prison cell you've all been reeled into. The @ORGANIZATION1 is one of the most beautifuly countries in the world, take advantage that! Now, without proper excersize, your putting you heart at serious risks. Even doing smaller things, like jumping jacks or cuntups, can help make you and you heart healthy! Your parents, and even your parents parents, are who brought you into this world, faught for you in times of need, and would do anything to protect you. What would you say if i told you technology was pushing them away? Texting at the dinner table while they are trying to make conversation, never leaving you room because you playing ""fun"" games, hiding behind he face of technology all the things a vast number of people do instead of socializaing with the people who matter most: family and friends. Although your friends @MONTH1 be more easy going they still came that your too busy hanging out with you computer to come meet up with them @CAPS3 single person can live without a friend and that friend needs you! Make some time for the people who have a special place in you heart before they disapper. To sum it up, techology is corrupting the minds of human beings... and it need to stop! like i said be healthy and happy and spend enough time with the people you are about who knows, maybe they an make you happier than your electric companion. So, fellow citizens, leap off that desk chair, shut off your electronic devices, and jump back into the real world.",10
921,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 about what the world would be like without computers. Scary thought? I had the same reaction. A world without computers is a world of non-communicating people and no where to gather information independently. The benefits of having computers are that they are a way of communicating with friends and family that don't live in your area or that you just haven't talked to in a while. They also teach hand-eye coordination which is good for almost anything. Lastly, they give people the ability to learn about other things in the world. In conclusion, computers have outstanding effects on people. First of all, in my perspective, having a computer, allows me to communicate to people I've met on past vacations. I can email, them and talk to them on social networks such as facebook. This is benefical to anyone that has lost touch with friends or even family. Being able to talk to friends I haven't spoken to in a white, gives me and others the opportunity to catch up and reconnect. In conclusion, being able to communicate with others on a computer, is only I, of the many benefits a computer has! Second of all, not only does having a computer allow you to talk to others but it can teach you hand-eye coordination as well. Dereck was a channel @NUM1 news reporter, ""I can hit some far balls that take the cake for some of our games. I truely @CAPS1 it's because my mother teached me now to use a computer! ""@CAPS2 especially benefit from computers because they teach them hand-eye coordination which is great for those homeruns, or even touchdowns! Third of all computers allow students and many others to learn and look up things they don't know. @PERCENT1 of schools around the country benefit from having school computers for research. On the other hand, businessman, parents, and even teachers use the internet to learn about things around the world and to gather information to teach their classes. Overall, computers have many benefits such as they allow you to communicate with others, they teach you hand-eye coordination, and even allow you to learn about things and places around the world. As a whole, this intelligent invention of the computer is an incredible machine that seems to have all the answers and a success for realiable information!",8
922,"Dear @CAPS1 Have you ever wondered how much the world wide web has to offer? I would definetly agree that computers have a benificial effect on people. They teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and they give people the chance to recconnect or new people. The internet has so much to offer and is absolutley benifical. Studies done by @PERSON1, doctor at @ORGANIZATION1 stated that @PERCENT1 of people who are on the computer typing have better hand eye coordination than those who do not. You could be improving your coordination and not even know it! Intelligent people would agree that being on the computer is very helpful to you. There are many computer games are there that you have to react quickly to and call for fast reflex and hand eye coordination. I know personally that it has help us. Since @CAPS2 been on the computer more I have noticed that my reaction time off this block for has shockly improved! Yes, I know that some people should get outside and exercise, but you can excersize and improve your hand eye coordination, either way you can go wrong. As the massive sits in space like high take fascinating worlds it the computers. The technology of computers to learn about the far away places. Kevin, scientist that @PERCENT2 of our knowing about space come from computers! For example think about google earth; it allows the human eye to see clear pictures of anywhere in the world! I think you would agree that without computers we would a lot of knowledge about the wonderful world around us. Would you rather us not have computers and not know half the stuff about we live in? By these high tech computers we can learn about life outside like space, and other galaxies. Did you know that @NUM1 of the population use the computer to talk, and reconnect to friends and family. I know I do! I know that people shouldn't be to computer, talking to people. But its a great way to stay in touch with people. They have awesome websites like skype and oovo that allows you to chat with other people over. Friendly, educated people agree that this is a good way to catch up with old friends from highschool or even way back to grade school. Another great aspect of online communicating is long friendships can be created. Newly explain, now they not online and got so close they ! Personally I know that I go to @DATE1 camp every year and make new friends. Internet websites like facebook helped me keep in touch with her. Clearly this is a great source to use! The time has come to decide the choice of using computers would deffinetly be a wise one. Without a doubt it will certainly help you; hand eye coordination and keep you talk or recconect with people. Most importantly it gives people the ability to learn about the wonders of far away places. So dont make the wrong choice, and appreciate and use all this computers have to offer.",11
923,"Dear Newspaper, In think that computers are not good for the society. There are three reasons why I think this and these are the following; @CAPS1, people don't get to spend time with their family. Second, you can get misspell words using instant messenger. When your doing your homework you can get distrated by the computer. The @CAPS1 reason why computers are bad for the society is because people don't spend enough time with their family, I know I don't. I spend at least half my day staring at a screen when I could be outside walking my dog with friends. Furthermore, instant messenger is the most addicting. When I type something, I use abreveations for any word. The professor at @LOCATION1 says at least @PERCENT1 students spell abreveated words in tests. For example, if you wanted to spell ""what"" instead the @PERCENT1 would spell ""@CAPS2"". Finally, my last reason why I think computers are not good for society is because you can get distracted by it a lot. I know that because I am driven to the world of computers. When ever I do my homework. I can't keep my eyes off the screen. Therefore explains that computers are not good for society. In conclusion, computers keep you from spending time with your family, has students misspelling words, and distracting you from doing your homework. I hope you agree with me on this.",8
924,"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers are a great piece of technology. Computers are great for many reasons. Three of these reasons are pleasure, convienience, and education. I believe that these three reasons are the main reason we use computers today. One reason we use computers is for pleasure. On certain websites, you can talk to friends, see what your friends are doing, you can even video chat with them. Also, you can watch movies, @CAPS4 episodes, and videos. In addition, you can listen to music, play games, and check sports scores. I strongly beleive that pleasure is one of the main reasons we use computers today. Another reason why we use computers is convienience. Most people in @LOCATION1 have a computer in their home. Computers are convienient because you pay bills on the internet. You email co-workers about jobs. In addition, computers can help people create websites so their their buisness is more noticeable. As you can see, computers are a very convienient piece of technology. The final reason why we use computers is education. On a computer, you can learn just about anything. You can learn about @CAPS5 history, sports, you can learn about current events in the world. Computers can help you study, take notes, and helps do your homework. When I have a project, I always use the computer to find important information about the topic. As you can see, education is the most important reason why we use computers. Now, I think you understand how computers are important in @LOCATION1's education, pleasure and convienience. I hope you listened to my opinion on computers and I also hope you continue to tell people how great and important computers are.",8
925,"The effects that i have on computers are good. I will be talkin about things that help the human nature with one technology computers. How people can learn about faraway palces. Helps them with school, and taxes. How to communicate with people that arnt with you. and my conclusion with all three reasons. The effects of computers on me are very good. Because they help people learn about faraway places. Lets say a family is planning a vocation to @LOCATION1. And they dont no anthing about it so they go on a computer and they could book a reserucition for a hotel. My second opinion on computer is that. you have a project for school and you need the right information. Thats not in books go on a computer. Lets say you have to do taxes online because your cripplede (@CAPS1) so you might wanna @NUM1 www. turbotax.com. and you hale your taxes infront of your eyes. My hold opinion on computers is. @NUM2 you have a friend or family member you lost contact with. Go on the computer and find them and then you guyz can plan a day were you guyz could catch up/ @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 guardians have issues about there child. They can confront the situation about three child. and last ley my last conclusion. Thats what i feel about computer. That we need them to communicate to other people. To do assignments for a job or school. Or to learn about places that you never been to before or would like to vacation to. And the reason why i feel like that is because i passion for computer. And i hope you like what i wrote. I hope i persuaded you to like computers more.",8
926,"To the editor of the @ORGANIZATION2, I am writing to state my opinion as to whether computers benefit or harm society. I believe that computers are a great tool for several reason. First, computers are a learning resource, and a way people stay updated with the world around them. Also, computers keep us connected with friends and family more easily. Clearly, computers are more helpful to people than they are harmful. Life as we know it today would be greatly altered without the advances in computer technology that have been made over the past few decades. Today if I need to know something, whether it be for @ORGANIZATION1 or my own reason I can almost instantly look it up and get answers from many different sources. This helps people to be more educated and updated with the world around them. Dr. @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 recently preformed a study on high @ORGANIZATION1 teenagers and concluded that, ""@CAPS1 with access to computers scored signficantly better on standard testing due to background information they have accquired while on line"". Along with the internet, there are programs such as @ORGANIZATION4, and @ORGANIZATION3, which help people to learn a new language, or write on the computer. Also, computers keep us updated with events that are happening in the world. For example, when the earthquake devestated @LOCATION1, I first saw it on the news, but got very few details. I the looked it up on line and imediatly get the death toll, the aid that was being given, and ways I could help donate. Without computers, I would have known none of this. Another reason as to why computers are so helpful to society is that they are tools that help us to keep in touch with others. With things like facebook and @CAPS2, I can chat with people, invite friends over, and even plan parties. Without computers, I would need to call each person individualy, but with computers I can write one message and send it to everyone all at once. This gives me more time to do things like play outside and exercize. Also, things like @CAPS3 and face book help people to stay in touch with old and distant friends. Studies done by @ORGANIZATION5 show that @PERCENT1 of people with some type of social networking account have a more active social life than those who do not according to doctor @PERSON1 this means that these people will have an easier time adapting to different social situations than these who do not. Clearly, this is a great benefit. In conclusion, the computer helps society a great deal more than it hinders it. It easily allows people to stay educated, updated, and connected. It helps people stay aware of the world around them and educated about everything. It makes things that would other wise take lots of time very quick, giving people the chance to do other things such as playing outside. It keeps people socialy capable and active, and allows people to connect with others. Without a doubt, computers are a very good thing.",10
927,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, The @NUM1's ware the beginning of a new age, computers had just come out and were mezmericing people with its intelet. But now more and more people think it’s a waste of time. I for do want think this within these lives you will see my opinion take shape for the following reasons it's an information high lets artists expand their craft and engenirs are now able to plan buildings and bridges on their @CAPS1 to the internet student's and people are of knowledge each day the internet is essenicial to people writting an essay in fact the super intendent of schools in @LOCATION1 has stated that over @PERCENT1 of students will use the internet to help them write an essay. We also don't have to go to the library any were to do research because we have a whole library of information at our house (the computer) another thing is that people are now able to communicate all over the world which will allow us to learn about other staight from the source. Artists are now able to do things were now a new art form of video games has out artists do you like to express yourself do! Music mixing has became my and it is over the will sometimes add additional and lapse other tracks it they don't have to use a typing machine any just jump on the computer type a keyboard. You can use spell check and edit undo instead of having to throw away idea that you didn't like. Artists have been by computers, And lastly are how able to plan out how a building or bridge might look, (which also with the video game making) @CAPS2 can make the house of their when you plan buildings and bridges on computer you can which makes them stronger, before you even start building them with the new soft ware available today how certain structural under natural disasters so they can pick the has the abillity of becoming have way. I hope you can see using way eyes and agree that computers are thely an amazing they that lets got information also help",10
928,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that people are spending to much time on computers, and I agree because people spend so much time on computers that @CAPS2 gets addicting, people don’t get enough exersize, and eyesite gots worse. So please keep reading my letter and I will tell you the side effects of the computer. Most of all @CAPS2 gets really adicting for a lot of people that they dont spend time with thie familys or sibleings and some kid get so adicted that they come from school and start useing the computer all day and dont study for a test or do home work. Now people spend so much time on the computer that they dont exersize or play sports with thier friends and just sit all day and get lazy and fat just because of the computer. We just need the computer just to chek @CAPS3 and facebook like I do but I just check my facebook and the go play basket ball. One of the biggist problem that I think is when you sit on the computer to long and get a head ache and ruins your ey site. So thank you for reading my letter and hope you agree with me.",6
929,"My oponion is computers should be used for many different purpuses. One reason is chating online with friends and family. Another reason is that if you are going far away and you know someone that can give you directions to where you are going then you can chat with them as they give you directions to where them as they give you directions to where your heading. Another reason is if you have family that does not live with you and you can't go an see them then you can chat with them. Another rwson is that of your going somewhere and you don't know the weather for the next day then you can go online and find out what's the weather for that day. Also if people really want to exercise then they can go on there computer and go to youtube and od exercise from there computer. Also if you want to see the @CAPS1 then you can search it on your computer to see what's going on. Lastly if you don't think it's rite for people to have computers then you should try to get one to see how much stuff you can do with it. You will be amazed. This is my reason why people should have computers to enjoy while chating, watching @CAPS1 and many other stuff that you can't probably imagine. Also, maybe kids should not have computers but they can get one when they get older. Also, if kids need to search from school then they can also do that there are many reasons why people should get computers. That my my opinion about why people should have computers.",7
930,"Dear, Local Newspaper @CAPS1 here to inform you that the time we spend on computers is needed because it helps you with information, it helps you to become smarter and it helps you with hand-eye coordination. I will now explain to you why the time we spend on computers is needed by stating these three reason. My first reason I'll like to state that will convince you with the time we spend on computer's are needed is it helps us with information and it teaches stuff about place's, people, culture and more it teaches us useful information which takes a while to learn so the time we spend on computeres is needed to learn new information. My second reason I'll like to state that will convince you with. The time we spend on computer's are needed is it helps us to become smarter. Say if you needed help with fractions you can go on a math site it helps you with it. Computers make you become become smarter. And at the end of the day it's about who's smarter not who does more excerise. My third and final reason which contribute to why we spend the time we spend on computer are needed because it teaches you good hand-eye coordination because it help with typing and become more faster to do essay's and when you have good hand-eye coordination you dont make a lot of mistake's typing. So I have come to my conclusion why a lot of computer time is needed because it helps with information, you become smarter, and it teaches good hand-eye coordination this is why a lot of computer time is needed probably even more computer time is needed. A lot of computer time is needed because you get smarter plus it beneifts society.",8
931,"Dear @CAPS1, I think that people I should they to excersize more than they go on the computer. Computer are one of the main reasons of our nations obessed rate being as big as it is now including junk foods like mcdoanld. I'm a big fan of computers myself don't get me wrong. I would on the computer all night if I could but I don't want my body out. I go to bed at @NUM1 I usally stay on the computer for an hour or two depends if I'm doing a project. Also goign on the computer less could make your life more fun instead of sitting inside go outside and play some sports like football, hang out with your friends have a @CAPS2 with your family. Do something else than be on . Conclesively, if people just puxh them selves to stay on the computer for an @NUM2 hour and a half the obessed! will go down. It could also help save our planet by saving the energy.",6
932,"Dear @CAPS1 of my local newspaper, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. These boxes can be harmful to their users' eyes. In addition, they lead to less interaction with “real” people. Finally, they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. Computers are harmful to our society. For starters, computers are harmful because they are very bad for our eyes. Between the @DATE1 @DATE2 and @DATE3, doctors saw nearly a @PERCENT1 increase in eye problems that resulted in either surgery, glasses, or contacts. This can be directly associated with the overuse of personal computers. Also, studies have shown that common citizens who use these cootraptions for over four hours each day end up with an extremely deteriorated vision by the age of @NUM1. Finally, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 stated that overuse of computers have led to a very negative affect on the eyesight of their workers. It can be seen, how work gets done faster, however the cost of medical treatments actually surpasses the little extra profit gained by modernizing. Secondly, computers are harmful because they lead to less time being with “real” people. To begin with, studies have shown that people simply don’t learn as much about their peers by talking to them through a box. Also, a study by the @ORGANIZATION1 has shown that there are roughly @PERCENT2 fewer conversations at social gatherings than just @DATE1. This is alarming because at that rate people @MONTH1 never get to know each other and the world @MONTH1 become an electronically based workspace. Finally @PERSON1, social relations professional, stated that people end up with a lack of understanding when they can’t feel the emotion a person has when he/she is speaking. Sure, you can video chat, but that still does not convey the real feeling behind a person’s words. Finally, computers are harmful because they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. To begin with, the lack of fresh air obtained by sitting indoors all day is very bad for lungs and can lead to premature breathing problems. Also, average people get @PERCENT3 fewer workouts, according to @CAPS4’s @CAPS5, which was not likely directly influenced by overuse of computers. Finally the obesity rate has risen from next to nothing to over @NUM2 in the past ten @DATE1. Research showed that the majority of the obese patients spent excessive time on their little boxes of ten. While you might feel that this is not completely due to computers, it has been proven time and time again that these machines are the main reason behind the world’s currently unhealthy lifestyle. Personal computers have a very negative effect toward the society of today. This technology has resulted in very poor eyesight in the general public. In addition, they lead to a much lower amount of social interaction. Finally, they end up forcing people into an unhealthy lifestyle. So, let the word out that computers are bad for society, and try to make the world a better place to live.",12
933,"Dear to whom this @MONTH1 concern I know everybody that dont uses computers are why are people effect by the computers. Well i think computer is better then newspaper, on news papers you could find the news, well of course but wheather, houses for sale, tv casting, jobs and others just the same way as @CAPS1 but instead it like virtual. It benefits society for certain reasons it depends. some times computerscan be a negative effects on people but it also teach people how to read, write, type, learn and other. What I about we can talk to others we can see pictures of people whom we no we can google into about things we need to no, it helps when they need to find they way around the mapquest. A negative issue with having computers with internet, certain websites that are not age able. Kids be on website thier parents dont bout, looking up with boys they meet over the @CAPS1, People dying making plans with someone the next day the person is gone missing. I think if experts take away computers must kids well be mad and upset and there will be nothing more to do but play video games and go outside and these are my opinions.",7
934,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Are you aware that more than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 families have ownership to a computer? Maybe so, but, were you informed that at least half of that @PERCENT1 have family issues or such related The issue in bond is if computers have a possitive effect or negetive effect on mankind. In @CAPS4 opinion, I feel that this invention @MONTH1 be is taking a negetive toll on society. I say this because now-a-days there are inappropriate websites that children should veiw, and it takes away time with family. But mainly because of the recent @CAPS3 issue. Without a doubt, youngsters such as are expertly and a website, we'll just do as we were told and on maybe we could find one by an accident. Who knows? All I know is, there too many to count adult websites that children from the ages of @DATE1 log on to everyday. This is unacceptable on a person why we should be prohibited in computers. No responsible parent would be caught dead with a @NUM1 year old on an adult website and computers make it harder such parents to do so. With such experience computers take away time with and when I had @CAPS4 computer, @CAPS4 always now we never spent time with her. She said the other day do I peel bananas,"" if i never got out on the computer, you would be right now,"" she was right. Whenever @CAPS4 brother and I got on the computer we'll stay in the all day. But every we've been together much @CAPS4 now and I feel that computers have a negetive effect on society is because of the recent @CAPS3 I was called to the office one day to be informed that a crew on @CAPS3 com had befriended me and they were using boys and girls for drugs and prostitution. People take advantage of computers and end reading peoples infos. This could have been prevented but it wasnt. Now it's your chance, I hope you will feel the same way as me when it comes to the negetives and positives of computers. But remember, computers have keep more websites that aren't good for young kids, it takes away time from family, but mainly because of the recent @CAPS3 issue.",9
935,"The question is does computers have a positive effect on society? Yes computers definetly have a positive effect on society. Computers teach hand-eye coordiantion, give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places and allows people to talk to other people online. Computers put a positive effect of people. First, Computers teach people hand-eye coordination. I mean, computers help people learn how to use there eyes and hands t the same time. A survey conducted by @PERSON3 shows that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people have better hand-eye coordiantion that use computers them that don't. Proffessor @PERSON1 says ""people that use a computer are much more coordinated than any othe person, it is a great discovery."" You @MONTH1 be thinking that s computer would make you less coordianted BUT, computers really help hand-eye coordination in people. In conclusion the more you get to learn hot to use a computer the better hand-eye coordinated you will be. Second, computers allow people to be able to learn about far away places and people. i mean that a computer can help you learn about a faraway @CAPS3 without paying a fortune in money to go the @CAPS3. I remember the time @CAPS4 my mom and dad was going to go to @CAPS1 to see a lot of the landmarks and my uncle came to my house with a brand new computer and my parents ended up staying home and saved themselves a large amount op money. Famous explorer @CAPS2 smome says ""before I go anywhere I always google it on my computer to learn about life, climent, etc, on the @CAPS3. I know you @MONTH1 be thinking that it would be a better experience to go to the @CAPS3 but, it is really expensive to go to very faraway countries. In conclusion, computer can help you save money and help you learn. Third, computers lets people talk to other people online. i mean people go to special websites just to talk to friends. A survey done by @ORGANIZATION1. Shows that @PERCENT1 of people talk to other people over those websites. aAmous social worker @PERSON2 says ""@CAPS4 people use these websites it helps them with their vocabulary and social abilities."" I know you @MONTH1 be thinking those websites are dangerous is at, viris software can prevent danger. In conclusion social abilities are up with computers. Lastly, computers teach people about faraway places, help social abilities and learn hand-eye coordination. Computers can help society and learning so help the growth technology today!!!",8
936,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2: The effects computers have on people are bad because they are getting too addicted, the computers is a dangerous site to go on, and their brain is smarter then the @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION1, they are getting too addicting because computers @MONTH1 have a benefit of you being able to serf the internet but you'll get hooked on it too much. For example, youtube is an internet siting that about @NUM1 people go on and barely get off. The people don't turn off their computers to just go get some exercise but just sit there staring at the @CAPS5 and messing up their eyesite. These people need to learn have the will power to get off the @CAPS5. Second, the @CAPS5 is a dangerous site to go on because some people in the @LOCATION1 give somebody their @CAPS3 on the @CAPS5 to somebody they don't know about. Almost @PERCENT2 of teens get kidnapped because od giving their @CAPS3 a way to stranger and @PERCENT3 of those teens don't get found. The @CAPS5 is also a place of where a child or teen @MONTH1 get cyber bullied. Cyberbullying is harrassing children or teens on the internet, when children under or over @NUM2 get cyberbullied they sometimes suffer through a deppression and don't tell their parents about it. Six months ago at my old @CAPS4, there was a volunteer at my @CAPS4 talking about cyberbullying and how he got so depressed because of the harrassment, that he commited suicide. The @CAPS5 is not always a safe place to be on. Finally, your brain more smarter than the @CAPS5.People can have the ability to depend more on their brains than on the their computers because your brains are like computers. About @PERCENT1 of people use their brain more often than computers and they have been successful through life. The brain is like a @CAPS5 because you can store information and nobody can hack into it. So therefore, computers have bad effects on people because they are getting to addicting, the @CAPS5 is a dangerous site to go on, and your brain is smarter than tha @CAPS5.",8
937,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers do not have a positive effect on people. Thanks to computers people arn’t being active as much, enjoying nature, or interacting with family and friends. One reason this is true is because people are not exercising, they're too busy playing on the computers. People are gaining weight, which is already a problem in the @LOCATION1 because of unnecissary technology. There are plenty of sports that could be done, such as soccer, baseball, football, and so many more. People seemed to manage fine without computers and were a lot more active before them. Another reason computers don't have a positive effect on people is because they don't go out and enjoy nature. People spend too much time looking up beautiful place and animals when they could easily go explore around outside! Take a walk by the forest or in a local park, even by the beach and you'll see loads of animals. Not to mention, the immense amount of different plants and flowers they have never noticed right behind their very own home! No computers and people could quickly start enjoying nature more often. Thirdly, a reason why computers arn't positive on people is because they're not interacting with other people. Some people are too busy on facebook or myspace, e-mailing or @CAPS3-ing each other. Sometimes they arn't even talking to who they believed they were, it not only dangerous but unhealthy also. Whats wrong with giving someone far away a call? You can actually hear their voice and know its them on the other line! Its rediculous how people will e-mail a friend thats down the street. It would be much simpler and healthier to just walk over to their house. The two of you can chat and take a walk, or play a game, not just sit infront of a screen the whole day. Computers make interacting with other people, in person, a lot more difficult. With computers people are not active enough, don't enjoy nature often, or interact with others as much. They simply are not a positive effect on people. You should also agree and let computers stay to perfessionals.",9
938,"To begin with, The learning ability people get from it has improved. The @CAPS1 source is very helpful to many people. The communication is much easier than talking on the phone. I believe that computers benefit the society in many different ways. First of all, children and people at home and at school use computers for learning purposes. In some grades at school there is a special typing program that helps improve typing skills. There are also hard drive discs that you can play with to help you enhance on your reading skills. It is just a way to make learning fun for young kids. Another great way to learn online is going to websites that have sample math problem and print the sheet out to practice. They are great ways to help learning. Secondly, the computer has many more ways to benifit someone. They are helpful for getting your local weather. In the winter you can see if your school has cancelled in seconds. Often I get projects where it calls for me to do research on a specific topic and it is very easy to look up simple information. The computer also has different links that are helpful for writing a paper, making a power point presentation, and excel spread sheet. All of those resources can either help graphing results for science class or even typing up a paper for @CAPS2. They are useful ways to make life easier. Lastly, computers tend to make communication a little easier. For me, when I'm out sick from school I like to tell my teachers by emailing them and even asking if I can make up any work using facebook, aim, myspace, and skype are all fun and fast ways to communicate with friends. All of the websites pretty much do the same thing but different people like diffrent sites that their friends are on you can email friends and family who live far away and even close. It's a way to get back and forth to eachother. In conclusion, you have heard the different ideas and I consider computers as a benifit. It helps learn, communicate, and most of all do the important things that we need.",10
939,"Dear editor, @CAPS1 do you do all day? The answer to that would probably be sit down in front @ORGANIZATION1 a computer all day. My friends say that this is very unhealthy, research as proven it and my mom has had experience with the computers. This just isn't healthy for our envierment and people. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 my friends say that computers are a waste @ORGANIZATION1 time. Most people who interact on the computer all day don't have a stable diet or even a good excersice ruinte. They say that all the junk kids and grown-ups acumulate in their daily life is unhealthy and will never go away unless they get up. They also say that without excersice our country will be filled with over weight people. Dr. @ORGANIZATION1 has done extensive research and has proven that computers are bad for you. @PERSON1 has gone all over the country to talk to people, and he specifically stresses that more people should get out and enjoy the nature but, no their sitting in front @ORGANIZATION1 a computer which is not good for them. He's taught people that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 the time if you get out and have fresh air your life will be so much better. My mom has had experience with computers and asures me that when she was younger you couldn't just sit there and not get out. She says that it's important to interact with your family and friends so you keep a stable relationship. Talking to your family will keep them intact with @CAPS1's going on in your life and hanging out with your friends will help with having more @ORGANIZATION1 a life without your household. She says any kid who does sit in front @ORGANIZATION1 a computer all day should be disappointed @ORGANIZATION1 themsleves. Editor you've done a wonderful job since you've taken the job! So, I feel that if you stress the point in your next newspaper about not having computers all the time you should always excersice like my friends say, the research as taught to enjoy your nature and my mother says to interact with your family and friends. I'm sure your next article will be a wonderful dream to people stating facts.",8
940,"Dear Newspaper editor, Have you ever been working on a paper, or reading something and theres that word you've never heard before? And you just cant figure it at? There where a computer can help you. Yes, some people do waste all their time, online but they have issues. Computers help us with all of our school projects and get research. You can @CAPS3 reconnect woth old friends that you havent sen in years, learned many good things with the internet and computers. First off we would not be able to do some of the things we do without computers. @CAPS1 us school projects, I use @ORGANIZATION1 word and powerpoint all the time. Our teachers prefer us to do that instead of handwriting evert thing. Getting information on the computer is so much faster and easier I mean the time it would take, you to look up the word ""elephants"" the encyclopedia is probably @NUM1 times more that it takes to it in can google. Plus there about @NUM2 1/@NUM2 seconds google call all up millions of websites just what ""elephants"". Another reason way computers are very beneficial is you can reconnect the old friends you havent seen or talked for a years. You can @CAPS3 meet new @CAPS1 us dating and facebook especially is three things and theres websites like twitter where you can follow celebrities and @CAPS2, computers are internet gives great information people. Some kids take online @CAPS3 @CAPS4 that does recieves around computers to do really have a choice. So in conclusion, computers can be very beneficial to lets of people I know its not a good thing to sit there all day and play cmputer games, but we lets of things accomplished, like school projects, or any project really. Its @CAPS3 nice to meet up with someone you havent talked to in a while sometimes. We have learned many great things from the internet. I hopre you consider my opinion.",8
941,"Did you know that @PERCENT2 out of @PERCENT1 children today, prefer to play games on the computer than do other activities? My opinion about this topic is that it is more important for children to do things other than sit on the computer all day. The reasons why I feel this way is because it is important to exercise, children tend to be addicted to playing on the computer, and if someone's life revolves around the computer than they most likely, won't be able to live on the ""real world"". When a child sits at the computer all day, they are not getting exercise. Today, obesity is a major problem. If people stay on the computer less and exercise more than this situation could decrease. Also, it is important for children to get fresh air. When someone plays on the computer they are not getting as much fresh air as you would outdoors. Lastly, who realize the importance of exercise tend to participate in sports, to stay active and have fun. Once you begin to play games on the computer, there is not turning back. In today's society, children of all ages, become addicted to the computer. Children who are addicted pay no attention to their surroundings. Also, some of these games might be inappropriate for younger players. Lastly, if children become addicted, they could do poorly in school for refusing to do homework. If a child is constantly on the computer than they have a chance of not being prepared for the ""real world."" In the ""real world,"" you can't rely on computer games. Also, games won't teach you things that you can only learn during school. Later in life, when you want to get a job, you won't be able to be accepted because you will not sound knowledgable. Lastly, when you are writing your application to go to a college, they will look at your records of sports and activities you've done in middle school. When they don't find anything, they will reject you because of your lack of participation. So when you are sitting at the computer screen, remember all the possibilities you have other than the computer. For example, it is important for you to exercise, playing games on the computer could make you addicted and you won't be prepared for te ""real world"". What is your opinion?",9
942,"Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer at home you enjoy? Computers are a big thing now in life, they help with many things. Such as staying organized, studies, and even entertainment. These are the three topics I will focus on, because I @CAPS1 believe that computers are useful and people use them a help to make life a lot more easy. Let me start by saying: ""I am a man who enjoys computers, as a way to talk to friends, listen and search music, watch videos on youtube, get school work done, and much more! Although, on main point is it helps me stay orginized. I can make many folders to store my work in, rather then losing or spilling something on the paper if I wrote it out. I can have my music, homework, projects, does work, videos, pictures, and much more saved and orginized so I know where it is everytime I go to find it. There can be no more, ""my dog ate my homework"" excuse. Moving on to the next topic. As I mentioned you can save work onto your computer, you can add without earasing as well, the work becomes neat and perfect everytime. So when you teacher is grading on neatness no worry. You can also look up information on any topic you are working on in class witch alows you to get. More information, the better the grade. Spelling is not a factor now, because your computer tells you when a word is spelt wrong. It even gives you suggestions on how to spell the word by underlining it with a red squigle line. This really helps because a lot of people have hard times with spelling. You can even get @CAPS2 to play a book you are reading, witch helps you learn new words that you @MONTH1 not have knew how to sound out. Teachers can even post notes on school websites of homework, when projects are @CAPS1, ext. No more, ""I didn't know/remember what was homework/project due. Lastly, entertainment is the biggest thing with computers. People go on every day uploading videos, pictures, blogs, and just about what ever they want. Games are played on computers by younger kids, just learning, while older kids are enjoying playing maze, driving, shooting, adventure, and much more types of games. Just about everyone using a computer knows of some chat website in witch they use to communicate with any one. Myspace, facebook, twitter, and so much more are used by people to talk, express how they feel to everyone/to just let it out), show love to someone, send birthday wishes, to @CAPS1 what ever. Those are endless possibilities at entertainment on a computer. Without a dobt, no more, ""I'm bored"". @CAPS1 you use your computer to @CAPS1 anything like this? If so you must enjoy it. People use computer for every thing from work to expressing feelings. Now what side are you at?",11
943,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 is a lot of positive things about technology, especially computers. Computers gives you a chance to communicate with people from all around the world; also computers gives you the opportunity to go on educating websites, and last makes it easier to shop and pay bills. Talking to people from around the world can be interesting. Computers help you do that, using the internet. You can learn almost different people and their cultural background, or even talk to your friends and families that live in other cities, states, or maybe even countries. Yes, some people might say they cost too much, but that's really only a one ime price. Computers can be very helpful to students as well as teachers. That reason is because students can get homework help on educating websites. On the other hand it helpful for teachers because they can put their students grades online and won't have kids bugging you about what's their average in a certain class. Yes, I know their are bad unappropriate websites, but their are a lot of ways to block them. For an example I had a @CAPS2 in @CAPS3 and I needed a lot of help, and my teacher told me about a website called studyisland and by going on that everyday boosted my grade up to a @CAPS4. Computers give you a chance to get your bills paid and do some shopping for a cheaper price. Their are ways that your things that you buy online could come a few days late; but think about how much time and money your saving because you ordered offline instead of going to the store. But it's also very helpful to people with disability. They're are a lot of positive things about computers. They give you a chance to communicate with people across the world, and gives you a chance to go on educating websites, and last helps you pay bills and go shopping. Local Newspaper computers are a big benefit too society, and without them a lot of things would'nt be possible.",8
944,"Dear @CAPS1, I feel as though computers have good effects on people. Throughout these next paragraphs I will be giving you all of my reasons on the things that computers help people do. I will be talking about how computers give people good typing skills, how they give information to people, and how they allow us to socialize. Over ninety four percent of people today own a computer ad feel as though they have learned many things from it. I bet you didn't know that! First off I will be telling you about how computers help people type. The @CAPS2 on a computer doesn't go alphabetically. This means that you have to practice more to get better in typing. I remember the first time I tried to use the @CAPS2 it difficult but as I tried more I got better. Once I got better I realize where the keys were and soon I don't even have to look up the computer and all of it's parts help people by teaching them skills that they @MONTH1 used in the. These skills @MONTH1 be needed in their job field. Computers are helpful device. The next thing I will be telling you about is how computers have information that is useful to and its where a child is working know a lot about the. It holds information and has website when the internet they. The computer. My final reason why computers have good effect. If you need to talk to a friend but dont feel like calling them you can just go on to a website and chat with them. There are so many that you just can't choose! Did you know what they are over one million of these kinds of websites? There is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 just to name a few. This also gives people the chance to socialize with people from all over the world. This in return causes people to have better social skills. Maybe they will become ore friendly and become more outgoing. This is all because of one little thing and that little things is the computer! So as you can see computers have many wonderful effects on people. They help people get better at typing give lots of information that people want to know and get better social skill cant you just learning and I dont know about not I can get a pretty clear image of that in my mind. Thanks for reading this and taking I say information.",10
945,"I think computers work @CAPS4 because it helps people with there own work. but computers do make people addicted because you mostly could do anything but mostly computers were able to use for help like work, maps, friend to find ot problems like for school it helps htem with math, science, social studies and @CAPS4 of more things. But people abuse it like ther @CAPS2 games and their dont even go outside they don't talk to there friends or even see ther friends its mostly not haven a life. And people dont feel like going to school because their over and there tired and ther just want to use the computer all day with not stopping. And so i think that people are just to addicted to compulers they dont use it for the fright reasons. Had then people get sick they could get hoadaks or they feel like puking. And they dont get to see that of things like go to the @CAPS1, @CAPS2 football, soccer, @CAPS3, valleyball or even take there own dog for a walk at the @CAPS1. @CAPS4 of people buy computers for games and @CAPS4 or muture people buy computer for there work and find were places are so the computer helps @CAPS4 but it addicted @CAPS4 of people. And computers do really break @CAPS4 because people could download a game or something and then it gives it virus. So you mostly spend about @NUM1 $ or @NUM2$ as fix it. And there new computers come and its like @NUM3$ and @NUM4$ and there different just from beand and ther go aboutmore faster. And whne people's computer break some go crazy and feel like doing some cordy stuff. Ther does feel like they does friends they only stay at the room for every they never down out at all and if they do come out the room they instly dont respect there parents they do whatever they feel like doing and they they act into troubles with the . So computers do help out sometimes they dont but maybe should make different changes.",7
946,"Dear @CAPS1 of society I am writing this letter to you to explain the many benefits towards computers. My first reason will explain the many ways computers help you @CAPS2 beleive that people using computers is a very good idea. They beleive this because computers make you really focus and pay attention. This gives you really great eye sight and amazing hand eye cordonation. A important ability that computers have is they are able to teach you about far away places depending on were you live. The reason people would probobility want to visit one of these places on a website would probobility be for vacational purposes. My third reason to why I feel we should keep computers is. There is a lot of websites you can join so that you can speak to your friends as long as there online. IAM, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 exc. These are all great uses for computers. Also people who own a well paying email system on these computer that tells them who wants to sell a piece of machinary, or anything that involves buisness ethics. Now you know my three very important reasons to why computers are a great way to get hand eye cordonation. A great way to learn about other states. And so you can talk to friends and have a email for buisness purposes. I hope you have enjoyed reading this and hope to see you on my side toward this topic.",7
947,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people. With a computer you could do so many things! They provide plenty of information, communication, and even entertainment. The only reason some find it to be unhealthy or negative is because some people abuse their ""computer-time"". Ever used the popular website ww.google.com? Sites like this, and many more, are great when you need information. Your practically just type in a word and automatically have hundreds or thousands of links, containing information on that word, to choose from! How could so much knowledge be named unhealthy, or have a negative effect on people? Computers have dictionaries, references, translators, encyclopedias, or even history pages that hold massive informatiion. So go ahead and expand your knowledge! If you log onto one of the most famous and well-used social networking websites, such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, you will find a new way to communicate with friends and family. Equipped with tools and various settings to keep you safe, you can find long-lost friends or out-of-touch family members and instantly catch up. Again, many people abuse those websites, putting up harmful words, inappropriate things, but that problem can be easily solved if you ""report' them to the website manager or to an adult. You just have to know how to be safe online, if not, the computer can be a very negative object for you. If you know how to use it right, you'll enjoy messages from family or instant messages from friends. There is a wide variety of entertainment on your computer. From video-sharing websites like www.youtube.com. to gaming websites like www.onemorelevel.com. These sites provide games and many videos, or even learning aids. There are sites where you can purchase music ang movies, or even clothes and furniature. Many stores have online websites wher you can purchase items and have them shipped to your front door. How could that possibly be regroup? Also, there are video games that are specially created for the computer, that you can buy, and have installed for isntant entetainment. I mean, who doesn't like to play games or shop, without having to go through the trouble of finding time to go out and do it? I know my aunts do. So you see, computers aren't negative, unless you abuse your ""computer-time"" and waste countless hours for no reason. You need to have a limit. Without it, it's just plain weird spending all day on a computer. So have fun! Learn, communicate, entertain youself.",11
948,"@ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people surveyed in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 agree that the use of computers benefits society. I personally concern with these @NUM1 people, computers have a positive effect on people. There are multiple reasons why I think the use of computers really benefits society, including it can teach good hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn abour faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Once again I do believe computers can have a positive effect on people. First of all, its's a proven fact that most sports on physical exercise to involve hand-eye coordination to some extent. The computer can help reach people from a very young age good hand-eye coordination. When a person uses a computer they have to keep an eye on the screen but still be able to use the mouse or keyboard. This takes alot of coordination if you think about why don't even love to look at the mouse on keyboard when they are typing, they just know where everything is. People disagree with what I'm saying often use the excuse that when people spend to much time on the computers they aren't getting enough exercise. However, I believe that is not true. The hand-eye coordiantion people learn on the computer help to improve their skill and coordiantion in sports, for example in baseball a person has to be looking at the ball to catch it, but at the samee time they have to move their arm to catch it. That is were the hand-eye coordiantion helps. This proves that computers can benefit society through teaching people hand-eye coordiantion. In addition to this @PERCENT1 of teachers at @ORGANIZATION2 believe that computers can be used as a great tool to help students learn. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. They give people acess to information about a foreign place or people be available in or other resources areas. On the computer one can go to a search sight and type in my place in the whole world. Then all they have to do is search and they have dozens of with information of that place and pictures, @CAPS2 are a society that is advencing in technology people are learnings learn and they can wtih great the of a button. In addition is think it's also a tool in schools. Teachers can have students do projects about different countries on people and the student can easily that the information on the computer. Computer benefit society in the way that they can teach about different loaction and people. Computers can help people become interested in these different topics and @MONTH1 be even inspire some people to go to these faraway places or hack different people. Finally, @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people asked had some kind of way to contact with people online, whether it was through email or facebook. Computers allow people to take online with other people. In our modern society it is very important that a person has friends, are great why to keep in with friends, if live very far away from you on it haven't to them in a while connecting them on the computer is a great way to keep i touch. Those who disagree with my opinion believe that spending time on the computer means less time with family and friends. I believe taht is just the opposite. Since @CAPS2 are living in modern ages families understand that kid leaves to college they might be going far away or even across the country. Having computer allows that family to chat an easy way to keep in contact talk with each other. People talking each other on line is just another way how computers benefit society. Its now or never! Computers can have benefit society. They reach people hand-eye coordiantion can be use all through our life. Most importantly they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Lastly they allow people to talk online with others. @CAPS2 are living a modern time, society is advancing everyday and computers are a huge part of it! They are having a positive effect on people.",9
949,"Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you know long of time spent on technology could result in cancer? ever since they were invented, computers have been advanced more and more even years. People, especially children, forget the risks of physical health. Family and friends and even mental health. Obesity rate is over to @LOCATION1, the highest it has ever People wouldn't even know technology is to blame. @CAPS2 you know the average @CAPS3 teenager spends at least @NUM1 hours on the computers? Think off all the calories that build up without exercise. If people could limit their at risk for diabetes. Diabetis is one of the most common disease involved with technology besides obesity. @NUM2 @CAPS4 are diabetic which means we are not at a safe health rate. If you limit computer use to @NUM3 hour a day, and work out atleast @NUM4 minutes a day, think of how healthy you will be you will have more healthy you will be you will have more energy, and mental focus, sleep wont be an issue, and you will be more physically attractive. Computers also lead friendship torn apart. cyber bullying is also a problem. @NUM4 of students are cyber bullies. This means that friendship will wont see each other if they spend all day on the mental health when they turn on the computer. @CAPS2 you know some forms of cancer are caused by the radiation of technological devices? Radiation eats away the brain causing altsimers, and other mental disease that snew at old age. Young adults in school also got used to texting. @PERCENT1 of students text and @PERCENT2 get used to terrible spelling, thats @PERCENT3 who accidentally write ""thru, lazy, or even native @CAPS5 during school."" This is the mental if of technology taking over. So as you can tell computers affect health, socializing, and even mentality. So don't be part of the problem, please, stop overuse of technology.",10
950,"Dear Newspaper; I bileve that computers are good for our society. There are maney resons as to why I beleve this. One reson is that it makes life easior, it also helps us understand what is going on in our lives today. If we didn't have computers how would we talk with people without phones and spred news. Computers make life easior by maney ways. For example, if you needed a docters permition to play a sport, it would be alot easior to send him/her an email telling him/her to send you can email saying you can you can show it to the sports team and they will alow you to play. We can also lirn things about our world today by using the computer. We can go on the internet and go to a news website and look at the wether so we can make plans for the day. We can find the newest technology ""I phone"" or ""@CAPS1 "". There are some people in the world that don't but have a computer. For example, my uncle is in the airfore and the only way we can get to talk to him is through the computer because they don't alow phones. Also if there is a pirson with good news and they want tell a lot of people send an email and forward it to everyone. I hope you understand why I beleve computers are a good thing to have in new society. I have that they make life easyor. It also helps us understand our life today and it helps us talk to people around the world. I hope you agree on my topic.",8
951,"Dear trained @ORGANIZATION1 reader, @CAPS1! Ah, I love hearing my computer thunk on when I wake up. Such a lovely sound. Some people feel the need to disagree and say computers are bad for people. But, I feel the computer is a magnificent invention. All that @CAPS2 will help improve hand-eye cordination, you can look up anything in the world, and you can even meet new people and keep in touch with faraway friends. The world is just a click away! What's this? You need to write a paper on how to play baseball and improve your pitching skills at the same time? No need to worry, you can just type that paper up on the computer! This is one of the many perks of owning a computer. @CAPS2 a paper is so much faster than writing @CAPS3 by hand. Studies show that @CAPS2 a paper is @PERCENT1 faster than writing @CAPS3 out. Even @PERSON1, and handwriting enthusiest, says ""@CAPS2 is so much easier than having to write! I type all my books proper handwriting."" @CAPS3's been said by officials that most hand-writen lovers are converting to @CAPS2 for better hand-eye cordination. If @CAPS3's used by the people that oppose @CAPS3, @CAPS3's gotta be great! Let's say your doing a project on panda bears, but you don't know anything about them. What do you do? Search @CAPS3 up on @CAPS4.com of course! @CAPS4.com is a bounty of information, serving up marsels of links for any-and every-topic. I remember this one time I had a big report to write but I didn't know anything about the subject. So what solved my problem? @CAPS4! @CAPS3's been proven that @PERCENT2 of information found on @CAPS4 is true. You know what else on the computer can help you with information? Just about any domain name on the web. Just type what your looking for, add .com at the end and @CAPS5! all the information you could need. Hm, what else can the computer help with? I know. Your friend that moved away, you can send her a message and get back in touch. Or, if you don't like your friend that moved away, you can meet new people. For example, @LOCATION1 is a sight designed to match people up for romantic relations. So maybe you don't like computers. Oh well, all I can tell you is that your missing a lot. Great hand-eye cordination, magnificent information, and colorful people like I said, the world is just a click away!",10
952,"My opinion about the effects of computers is that computers do help you but people should not us the computer to lot because people should exercise, interacting with family and enjoy nature. Exercising is more important than a computers because it will make you health, you will not be sick so much. Interacting with family is more important than a computers because the @MONTH1 help you have friend but not a family's help you when you help and maybe that friend in the computer is maybe not real that is why it is important to interacting with family. And the last thing that is more important than a computers is enjoying nature. It is fun because you are not bored. You be outside, you will not think about the computer because you will be enjoying so much. My opinion is that computers should only be us to see your mail or to learn something you want to find out in the computer.",6
953,"I don't think that computers is the most positive effect. Because most computer's are not like that the computers are not the smartest but it does help you when you need to do something like a project when you have to look for pictures and when you need help with math you can use the calculator on the computer but the computer does not help you on all your subject's the computer only help's you on a couple of your subject's that is the main reason I use the computer. Sometimes when I'm doing homework I let the computer do it for me so it is eaiser for me to do and I look for website's on it they give you really good website's that is why mostly everyone use's the computer they mostly use the comptuer to look for job's, car's, or a house that is what they mainly use the computer for most people do not like useing the internet because they think it's cheating to use the computer.",6
954,"Lately, a technology buzz has hit all over the world. Where ever you look, be it at home, at school, at work, or on the streets, you see people texting, talking on phones, blogging, and other computer related things. This concerns some people. They believe that these generations are relying too much on computers and not spending enough time exercising outside or socializing. But here is where they go wrong. These experts are judging computers too harshly, for it's not like everyone is zoning out in front of a glass screen, sucked into the world beyond. @CAPS9, most of these ""computer geeks"" are using the computer for useful things, while they are also used for entertainment, computers also help society to reconnect with long-lost friends or even get directions to a well-know resuraunt. As you can plainly see, computers are not turning us all into zombies. Computers are sometimes seen as a nusence. Parents complain about the many times they have to drag their sons and daughters from the screen for dinner or a soccer game that started @NUM1 minutes ago. But you see, this doesn't mean its bad. Everyone goes on the computer. ""Even though my father complains that I'm on @CAPS1 too much,"" @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1, says. ""@CAPS2 forgets that @CAPS2 has one of his own."" This is an example not unlike many other student's parents. About @PERCENT1 of adults confess that they too have fallen into the new fads such as @CAPS1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. So why do we need these things? What seems to make them so important to us? The answer is simple, it makes us feel connected. Then again, if you think about it, maybe not so simple. Many people have different opinions on why the computer is so important to them, but most agree that friends is one big factor. ""Everyone is already online."" @PERSON2, computer technician, informs. ""@CAPS6 all your friends are in something, wouldn't you want to as well?"" @CAPS7, as the famous saying, @CAPS8 your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?, flashes through your mind let me answer that for you - @CAPS9. Being connected and diving off the deep ends are too different concepts. As you find friends from highschool or just friends from school, your glad that @CAPS7 you can talk to them face to face - or computer screen to computer screen - again. Last, but certainly not least, the computer is a great resource. While some people complain, others are using what it has to offer by looking up directions to events or facts for your next report. This is how websites like @ORGANIZATION2 make billions from the words being typed into the search engine. The facts and places that arise from the computr are like gems waiting to be found. In conclusion, its easy to see why the computer and its resources are so loved. Everyone uses it for different things and different hobbies. Whilesome for pure entertainment, others for information, and another for reconnection. My personal favorite finiding the true treasure of hidden bands, the fantastic ones, that @CAPS9 one even knows. And so, this is why I'm convinced the computer is a positive impact on the world.",12
955,"Imagine standing outside, the warm sun dancing on your back, jumping into the pool and feeling the cool water flow around you. But no, that won't happen. Because children and their parents are spending way to much time on their computers. People aren't getting enough excercise, it can be very dangerous and families are spending less time with each other without computers, so its worse with them. I think people need to realize that computers are over the humans. Humans especially children, need exercise. But with computers that isn't really possible. More and more children are becoming obese by the year. Computers are making that happen quicker. Instead of sitting at the computer eating potato chips, children should be outside on their bikes, or swimming, or playing sports with their friends. If it is winter, the least kids could do is go sledding. Children need to expirience nature, not the screen of a computer. The computer can also be very dangerous. @NUM1 year olds are making facebooks! You can find @NUM2 year old on the internet now. Naive teenagers go find ""friends"" in chatrooms or on @CAPS2, and their ""friends"" lie to them, about their age, another indentity. Many teenagers go and meet someone they met online and end up getting raped or killed. There are many sick people in the world, and many of them use the internet to find people. Lots of teenagers give out personal information like their last name, cellphone number, or where they live, and thats an easy way for predators to find them. It puts them, and their whole family in danger. Computers are breaking up families, and friends. Things like @CAPS1, @CAPS2,@CAPS3, farmpring, @CAPS4, etc. are turning people against each other. Some families even eat dinner at the computer. When friends go over other friend's houses, they just sit on the computer. Why is it so fun to just look at the computer screen? Families need to do something together like eat dinner together, go out for ice cream, go shopping, something, anything but going on the computer all day. I'll admit, I am a little addicted to the computer. But I don't go on it @NUM3, like some people. Instead of eating dinner at the computer, go out to dinner as a family. Instead of online shopping, go shopping with your friends. It isn't hard to at back @NUM4 or @NUM5 hours of going on the computer. Am I the only teenager who thinks this? Maybe. But I know that I am benefitting myself by cutting back on the computer. We don't get enough exercise, it can become really dangerous, and family and friends should start spending more time together. Computers can do everything more than humans can, and we need to stop it.",10
956,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know, more and more people are starting to use computers. In my opinion, I think the computer does benefit society in many ways. One positive effect it has on people is that they can communicate. Through the computer, people are able to send messages to each other. If someone doesn't have a phone or car, they can simply go online, write a message, and click the send button. This is an easy way to communicate with someone who lives half way around the world @CAPS2 well. If you have family members who live far away, you can also send them pictures of yourself, friends/family, and places you've been to. They can receive them and also send pictures back. Another positive effect computers have on people is that they can learn new things. The internet allows you search different topics and basically has everything and anything you could ever think of. If you go on @ORGANIZATION1 and type in a word like 'dog,' you'll see a bunch of websites that will take you to other websites that are just about dogs. You can find a list naming types of dogs, how old a dog can live up to, where most dogs are found, how to care for them well, etc. The internet lets you explore new things and help find ideas. You name it; they got it. The computer also cames in handy when you have nothing to do. If you're bored and can't play outside because the weather is bad or you broke your leg, you can play computer games, listen to music online, or write your own story on a word document. Playing computer games can teach you techniques to help play a game better, @CAPS2 well @CAPS2 keep you busy. If you want to listen to music to keep yourself entertained, you can go on @CAPS3 or other sites and find any song you want to hear. It's better than listening to the radio because sometimes you don't like the song that's giving. If you're also in the mood to write a story, you can open a word document or if you just want to type whats on your mind. @CAPS2 you can see, I think the computer is a facinating tool to use. You can communicate, learn new things, and keep yourself entertained if you're not able to do something active. Just remember, whenever you can, go out and play or hang out with friends and family.",10
957,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 are so many people that addicted to computers. They think that computer can help them but yes to others it helps them to their work and education. Most children are addicted to computer games. @CAPS1 are @PERCENT1 of children who are addicted to computers. For some reason, computers had a lot of effects on people. It might affect children's education or it might be the cause why your bills of electricity went higher. The worst of having computer at home, it can be a reason for millions of teenagers that got killed for always talking online with people they don't know. Computers are sometimes dangerous for people. Do people still need computer? Having computer at home is not good specially to children. This is because computers can affect their education. Parents don't want that to happen to their children. A lots of uneducated children that stay home or do drugs in the street. Yes computer can help them for their studies or computer can help them for their studies or projects but other children in the computer because they just want to play games. That's why a lot of them didn't learn anything at school but they learn a lot in the computer games. They should stop the computer games. Also, having computers at home can be the cause of people's electricity bills that went higher than they had @DATE1 when they didn't have computers. Other people think that computers can't give you any problem but computers works with electricity and pay for the electricity bills. If you have @MONEY1 for your electricity bill @DATE1 year when you didn't have computer, it might go high to @MONEY2 for your bill that now you have the computer. It's a big problem for you. Nevertheless, computers are dangerous. Computers can be good or bad. Without a doubt, @PERCENT2 of teenagers have been killed because of talking online with strangers people. Most website like @CAPS2 is now in danger. @DATE1 @DATE1 months, husband and wife got killed because of @CAPS2. The husband killed his wife because of being ""single"" in her relationship status on her @CAPS2. She got shot by her husband. However, her husband killed himself. They're both got shot! Talking online and meeting up with strangers people you don't know can be a reason of your lost. Parents should not have computers at home unless they will use it but it needs to be at their room where children can't use it. Now is the time to agree! Do we need computers at home? Can we live without the computer? We don't need computers at home and yes we can live without the computer. We can do any activities with our family, exercise for our health, go picnic with friends or we have fun go on vacation with the whole family. Local newspaper, I want you to tell the people to stop the computer and tell them to go out with their family and have fun doing activities or go on vacation.",8
958,"Dear local newspaper- I understand that computers are becoming more of a ""must have"" in peoples everyday life. I believe this is a great thing! If you're on the computer you type which helps improve peoples hand-eye coordination. Also, you can learn more about people, places, cultures and much more. Lastly, you can communicate online with other friends or even meet new people. To begin, I think having computers is a good idea because it helps people improve on their handeye coordination. My cousin @PERSON3, who is a big time baseball player, used to have trouble catching the when he was younger. He kept trying over and over again and never gave up. Then, for his birthday his parents bought him a computer! He was so excited, but when it came to typing papers, he wasn't the best. Not only did he practice baseball but also typing. His family realized that buying him that computer was of the best ideas. It improved his baseball career (by throwing and catching the ball) and increased his grades in school. However, @PERSON3 is not the only one that has gained hand eye coordination from computers. A recent study from yale college shows that @PERCENT1 of people that use the computer for atleast a month gains some sort of hand eye coordination. @PERSON1, a teacher of the computer class at high school states, ""@CAPS1 freshman that I get in my class tells me that computers have made their sports careers easier because they now have better hand eye coordination."" Computers have two things in one, you learn to type and help your hand eye coordination. Do you want you @CAPS3 to be lacking that positive ability in life? In addition, computers help you learn more about people, places and cultures. I heard a couple nights ago that @ORGANIZATION2 had an earthquake. I also learned about the powerplant explosion in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. How do I know all of this you ask? The front page on @CAPS2.com! But, i'm not the only one who has gained this knowledge from the internet, so many more have too. @ORGANIZATION1 took a poll about how many @CAPS3 use the computer to do research and @PERCENT2 answered that they did. Does the society really want to take away @CAPS3 knowledge of whats going on around us and our history? In conclusion, people can communicate with friends and relatives. This is great if you haven't seen them recently, or if you want to just stay in touch. For example, @PERSON4, mycousin, just found me on facebook. I haven't seen her for eight years abut now I talk to her all the time. We talk about visiting each other and how our family's are doing. But, you can also talk to your friends too. Studies show that @PERCENT3 of @CAPS3 between the ages of eleven and eighteen talk to their friends over facebook on a daily basis. Dr. @PERSON2, a teen psychiatrist, says ""I think this is a great idea for @CAPS3 to communicate with other @CAPS3 through the computer. It gives them the chance to interact in a different way."" @CAPS3 have such a good lifestyle for them, do you want to feel guilty for ruining that? Finally, people have perfect opportunities right in front of them. Computers help improve hand eye coordination and helps you learn. It also lets people interact with others in a different way. Do you think that these golden ideas are bad for our society?",9
959,"Dear Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you imagine life without your computer? No? Well that's what I am trying to change. Millions of @CAPS2 spend countless hours with their eyes glued to '@ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3 and @CAPS3 monitor screens. Spending that much time sitting in one space isn't healthy, not only do people not get enough exercise but they don't get the chance to apperiate the natural world around them that is ever changing. Teens and even small children get lost in cyberworld and don't use their after school time wisely to study or do homework. The internet is also a dangerous place and the growing computer use with maximize the problem. To begin, the obesity rate in @LOCATION1 is growing rapidly, a recent study done by the @LOCATION2. goverment shows that @NUM1 people are over weight and @NUM2 people are on the of obesity. We @CAPS4 could decrease the obesity rate and be healthier and happier by exersicing and getting out more. Spending all your time glued to a computer screen will only increase your chances of becoming over weight. Secondly, the more time you spend cooped up inside the less time you get to enjoy nature. The natural world is ever changing, and you will miss out on a lot of amazing opportunities if you hardly ever step foot outside your front door. Execive comouter use will wear them out quicker than normal, where does your old word out computer go when you get the @ORGANIZATION2? A landfill! The more your use your computer the faster you will trash it. If every @CAPS5 threwout one computer a year their would be over @NUM3 million discarded dells, gateways, macs, we would be living in trash. @CAPS1 exesive computer use ruins the environment, and hurts your health! What are you waiting for? Go run outside! Ride a bike! Give your computer a break. Finally, the growing computer use increases the amount of internet predetors, and the odds that you or your child could be tougeled skyrocket. With more and more kids on the computer each okey the, internet saftey level drops. Not only could these children be watching inappopriate videos on youtube or cyber bulling on @CAPS6, they could be giving personal information out to people they don't even know without realizing it on myspace and facebook, @PERCENT1 of kiddnappings are possible because of information found on the computer. Do you want any thing like that ever to happen to you or your family? I didn't think so. Get up off of your comfy computer chairs and take a walk. Limit your internet and computer use, all it does is hurt you, theres no gain. Thank you for reading and don't support rapid advances in computer technology.",10
960,"Dear Newspaper writers, I belev that difrent web sites have difrent effeks on people. For exam pull @ORGANIZATION1 has news about what is going on in the world. Other websites all difrent types of games on it could be bad for some people because some of the games are not vary apropreit. Most edicatinal web sites are ment fo help people learn. One person can learn so much with a computer. You can buy and sell a iturn that you own an get many all on one web site. A computer can be used for many difrent perpests.",5
961,"Dear, local Newspaper, I hear that you think computers have an effect on people. Will I disagree with what you say. I think computer will help us learn, and do things faster. Haveing computers helps the community learn more. My first, reason I think we should keep computers because it helps people with there hand eyes coordination for jobs. With the skills of typing you can work at places like the city of @LOCATION1 where they type every day and work hard. They also learn more and more facts about the sociatis. Without knowing how to type you @MONTH1 not get any top class jobs. My second, reason telling us that computers are helpful is that it helps your children do better in school by learning how to type for high school, and learning math, sce, social studies and language arts. Computers also helps kids at young age do math and other with their character, like dora, @ORGANIZATION1, elmo, and others. So learning on computer can help you learn and have fun at the same time. Which i know your parents would like. Even new born babys can learn how to read, write and do math and grow up and can be president one day. My third, reason is that it helps send things all over the world. Without computers we would have to do it old fashion style. Also with computers you can talk to family member that live far away from you (In state or country) and you have not see them in a long time. Or you can chat with old school friends from back in the day. You can also buy thing off the computer. In my conclution I told you that computers can not effect people by telling you that your child can do better learning and parents also. I also add that it helps you get jobs and help you with your hand and eye cordination in school and out. So computer help the community.",8
962,"Dear @CAPS1, You use a computer a lot right? Good if you @CAPS7 because @CAPS7 you beleive that experts are questioning why @CAPS5 use them a lot? Well I think people need them because its how @CAPS5 know whats going on in the world, its how @CAPS5 know how the weather is like so accidents can be avoided, and you you can flip on your @CAPS2.V., but than you have to wait for what you want to go on. So you decide @ORGANIZATION1, should @CAPS5 be outside more? Don’@CAPS2 you need to know whats going on too? Of course you @CAPS7, everyone does. I think that it is important that @CAPS5 know @CAPS4 a meteor is about to strike the world no? President @PERSON2 even says the computer is where @PERCENT2 of the world gets info. On whats going on. Are you just going to sit there and not listen to the president of the @LOCATION1? Don’@CAPS2 think so. Im @PERCENT1 sure that @ORGANIZATION1 doesn’@CAPS2 want to be known as the accident State. Well thats why @CAPS5 need the computer! For people to know if I will snow, sleet, or if there is bad traffic than @CAPS5 need to go to the internet to find out @CAPS4 and where and what time. CEO of @CAPS3, @PERSON1, says “@CAPS4 someone says ‘@CAPS5 might be getting some snow or rain’ than they usually go right to the internet ” You you can turn on your @CAPS2.V. to find out whats going on, but not all of it you will want/need to know. So you will have to wait. The internet just does it right on the spot. No waiting involved! (unless you have a bad internet connection) @CAPS7 you think these reasons are making a good argument? I @CAPS7. @CAPS7 you use your computer for finding out whats going on, what the weather is like, and instead of the @LOCATION2? If so I think you would aggree with me.",9
963,"Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1 opinion's on what effect's do computer's have on people is without the computer we couldn't research important people and event's. Also we couldn't type important paper's. Last we can talk to other people. Now that @CAPS1 first opinion is without the computer we couldn't research important people and events. This is one of @CAPS1 reason's because if people didn't know anything about an important person they could look them up. For an example who is harry @PERSON1. He was the @NUM1 president. I didn't know who he was or what he did until I looked him up on the internet. @CAPS1 second opinion is we wouldn't be able to type important paper's. I say this because people that have @CAPS3's mostly have to type paper's. And without the computers everything would have to be hand-writen. Also some people have bad hand writing. @CAPS1 last opinion is we can type to people that are online and offline. I say this because if you have to tell a family member, or a friend something important but, you phone is dead or broken you can e-mail them. Or if you have a facebook you can tell them on that. Last you can I.M them. Now that you know three opinion's on what effects computer's have, people can alway's excrise around there house or around there block.",8
964,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 glad to see that you have a debate if computers are good or bad for human society. Well I would like to state my opinion if that is good with you. In my letter @CAPS2 going to tell the bad stuff about computer and why there not good for society. Well I dont think computer are good for society because you dont work-out as much as you use to. I can say that a fact because I use to work-out then a computer games came out and I spent @NUM1 hours a day playing it I had no time to spend with my family, I had no outside commaction it was like it topic over my life. Plus I know a lot people who feel the same way. The computer is like a addiction. I say this because once you hit the power button you cant get off. All the commution website are hard to get off because there starting to put games on so you wont log off as fast. THe have different website that play video of things that are funny. Like once you find it you click and a of things so when you look you on same thing else. Dont get me wrong you can see and talk to family members you dont see but you dont have ime to go to the park and have fun and enjoy nature it like you looked up. I dont think we should get rede of computers but we should spend least tine as we do know. I know people are going to be upset by waht I say but we as a society are addicted to the computer. Every were you look theres a computer. I going to leave on one not would you pick computers or life? ",8
965,"Dear @LOCATION1 news paper I have over heard this debate on weather computers are good influinces on people or not. I am sending you this message to state my opinion on the matter and in my opinion I think the computer has very good efects on people. Not only dose it have a good effect on people it also effects companies places and governments. There are many reasons why it has a good effect on people but the first and maybe one of the most important is it is an amaizing learning tool. When people are on the internet they could learn just about anything they want to on the giant mass of information we call the internet. It not only dose this but people learn how to do things through simulators from flying a plane to driveing a car. There is even more learning ability on the internet because a lot of people get home schooled on it through the internet and this @MONTH1 be an important part of their education because they might not be able to go to school because they are alway on the road or they move a lot of whatever their reason is. The computer is an important part in the invancement of the people's education. Not only can people use the computer in education but it is used as a tool in many ways, lets say your making a movie and need special effects they will use of photo shop or you need to collect and store changing information like lets say you want to stack you can always or down on a computer. Even if you were a construction worker you could your blue prints with pinpoint accuracy. Another less important thing about the computer is it gives many people entertainment. Lets you come home your bored you have nothing to do play a video game look around on the internet, it is also an important way of getting their music and or videos. This also effects many buissness and if the buissness go under becaus people werent moving ther stuff a lot of jobs will be lost and that is the last thing we need. The government also relies highly on the internet. They need it to make plans, save soldiers, and comunicate with other countries. And last but not the least we have the fitness and wellfare of the people useing computers. All I can really say to that is it is their decision. If they get off they can and if they won to sit there and waste or ",9
966,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you can see, about @PERCENT1 of our population over use the computer. They should be out getting fresh air and spending time with their family and friends. On the other hand, the computer can come with much use. For many people. Family lives quite a distance away, @CAPS1 well @CAPS1 some friends and getting out of touch is a possibility. You can also learn about far away places, like @LOCATION1. The computer is often used for projects essays which is important. You can learn quite a bit with a computer. The computer can be used in many ways. One way is to keep in contact. Sure you can just go to the park and spend time there but not everybody live that close. For people who have relatives or even good friends who live quite a distance, a computer is what you @CAPS2. It is a great way to keep in contact. You can keep everyday updated at all times. For example, my cousin recently went out of the country for college she will be there for a few months so she has her own blog on the computer to keep everybody update and stay in contact. The phone is not always an option. To learn about far away places is great. Online you can learn about the history of specific places. You can see the towns and so much more. You can even see pictures. Maybe one day you will even get to see those specific places in person. How cool would that be? School is a big thing now-a-days. Students have project after project assay after essay and its a lot of work. @CAPS1 you grow older it becomes more work and with a computer, you will have less weight on your shoulders. With essays you can type them, and fix your mistakes without it looking sloppy. Projects are easy to fix to: so messing up isn't a big deal. On the other hand, more americans now than ever before are over weight. The computer has a lot to do with that. Most people will come home and sit on the computer for the rest of the evening. They don't realize what a big effect a computer can make on a person. More people should be out exercising. Spending time with family. Computers can be negative thing or positive. It can be more helpful than you could imagine. But, yet it can make a huge negative effect on people. It can help keep contact with people to learn about far away places, or even school work. Let it be benificial, use it when you @CAPS2 it.",9
967,"Dear newspaper editor, I think we should have internet, or computers at our houses. We should have it because we can chat with our friends and family, noone would get bored doing nothing and we learn new things from different websites. We should be able to communicate to our friends and family @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in our school think having a computer is good. For example my friend moved to @LOCATION1, we couldn't talk on the phone. It was long distance I talk to her over facebook. There are a lot of websites you can talk on like facebook, twitter or even myspace you can even skype. skype is when you have a webcam and you talk threw it. My mom said that most of her friends chat online with her. It doesn't matter how old are you. Anyone can learn important things. There are a lot of websites that are educational @PERCENT1 things on the computer are worth having. If you are old and you can't go to school just go to google and type any math term, science, @CAPS1, or even learning a new language. Everytime I have to do my social studies homework I go online trust me it's really helpful. Some things on the computer are very fun. You won't get bored on the type of games they have. A lot of parents complain that their children are doing bad things in the streets. The do there kind of things, because are bored @NUM3 people think that statement is true. If they had a computer, and playing games, or talking to friends, they would be like they are. @STATE1 and @PERSON1 are two state that have more people that go on the computer than any others states. Remember it's not only fun. Everyone enjoys having a computer. I think we should have internet access because we can do a lot of things some people think it's bad, but not everything is. We should have a computer, because, we can chat with friends, we can learn important and interestings things and we won't get bored. I hope you made up your mind and decided that all internet access is not a waste of time. I'm not the only one that thinks that "" a computer is what keeps or alive"".",9
968,In my opinion i think that computers help people. It helps them with imformation that they @MONTH1 need. It can also help learn a lot of things.,2
969,"@PERCENT1 of people agree that computers make life less complicated. I also agree with this. Using computers teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and lets people talk online with other people. I think that these are all very important. Why wouldn't you want to have strong hand-eye coordination? I think this a very important skill. Computers help teach hand-eye coordination and they keep it strong. While you're looking at the screen your hand is moving the mouse where you want it to go. Good hand-eye coordination is used for a lot of things; mostly everything. If you play some sports like baseball, hand-eye is one of the most important elements. Why not make that stronger off of the feild? Also, hand-eye can be used to @ORGANIZATION1 while taking notes. Hand-eye is involved with almost everything you do. you can't have a poor hand-eye coordination or else you won't be able to function properly. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors agree that hand-eye very important for healthy living. I love to travel, but I want to know about the place I'm going to before I get on the phone to go there."" said @PERSON1, a science teacher at @ORGANIZATION1. He feels the way, I'm sure, a lot of people feel. They want to know about the place they are going to and they want it to be current. The computer has plenty information about a lot of different places in the world. Some books don't offer as much information or they need to be updated. Computers are also very good for learning about other cultures and traditions. No one wants to be ignorant right? People want to know what's going on in the world quick and easy. The computer does this. I remember when I was about @NUM2, our phone broke in our house. We couldn't go out and get one right away either. The only way we were able to communicate with our family and friends was by computer. The computer made it easier to e-mail everyone and tell them why we weren't answering our house phone. This happens more often than you think. People need to communicate through computer a lot. At work, if you need to talk to an employee or co-worker and you can't leave your desk, you can just e-mail the information to them. @NUM4 out of @NUM2 employees say that it is much faster and easier to e-mail information as opposed to talking them on the phone or in person. A lot of people agree that computer make life a lot easier. Computers teach hand-eye coordination and they let you communicate with other people. The most critical reason is that computers let people learn about faraway places and people. You can make a difference in the way people feel about computers. Write to your local newspaper. It's now or never!""",10
970,"Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordiantion. You can also learn about different people and places. But it also allows us to communicate with the people online. Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordination. Because it's rely important to have hand-eye. And when your out in the world you rely need to be able to look at something and pick it up or say if you get into a altercation with someone. So it's rely important to have hand-eye. Another reason why I feel computers have a posative effect on people is because you could learn about diffrent stuff over the internet. Like learning about far away places and people. So the internet is giving you a great opportunity to learn more about or earth, other than your back yard. So technacally it's preparing you for life. My final reason why I think the computer has a posotive effect on people is because it allows people to talk to other people who are online. Like say you dont have a phone but you have a computer and you need to tell something very important to someone; you could do it online. And people say it's one of the fastest pieces of technology known to mankind to people who need it. Those were my three reasons why I believe the computer has a posotive effect on people.

971,"Dear editors of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 morning, my sister wakes me up to go to school. She uses her cell phone to set an alarm. A few years ago, my mom would come in and tell us it was time to get up. Now, we have one small device that we carry around with us to do our work. Most everyone has cellphone now, and it does much more than allow people to talk to one another from two different places. Now we can play games, go on the. These advances in the technology are making us very selfish. I, for one, do not approve. For starters, all of these new and improved gadgets are time consuming. With all the things to do in the world, we could all be doing something helpful, fun, or productive. Don't you agree? I mean, if you consider the idea that we all could be hitting the gym or studying for school tests and quizzes, then most teenagers would be in much better shape, physicly, and mentaly, @CAPS2. @PERSON1, my aunt an former physisist, said. The rate at which most students and kids grow increasingly more obese, @CAPS3 because of these new ideas involving phones and i-pods are completely sickening. The more time we spend using these items, the more we oppose the idea of being active? You can clearly see how we are growing less energetic, and much more careless of our time. Furthermore, the advances in today's society are pushing on the boundries at internet safety. Sure, people might claim that they can block out other people, but sometimes when someone posts something on the web, they don't always hide it well enough. They could have blackmailed one of your friend into commiting a crime, right? That happened to one of my cousins, @CAPS3 last year. The police took a long time to find her after she had been kidnapped, because the person who kidnapped her hid the evidence by a chain of blackmails. Do you see how important it is to spend less time on these silly computers? It sucks us into a virtual world that is sometimes 'bloody' or 'war-like? My brother learned swearing from the new & advanced game of @CAPS5. It's a fighting game (@CAPS6!) I implore your company to make the righty decision and write to help pull us off of our butts and get us up and going strong again. I hope you take my advice, and i thank you for your extremely valuable time and effort.",10
972,"Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper: @CAPS1 you really think computers are that good? Computers are so helpful today almost everyone has one. Computers are wonderful they are great ways to find information, they connect people from all over the world, and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 opportunities, hopefully at the end of this letter you will agree with me. Firstly, they help people find information. Computers are great ways to find information with google and other programs like it the whole world is at your fingertips. In my school surveys show @PERCENT1 of all students use the computer to help them research for school projects and asignments with computers you can view many diffrent websites from all around the world about a topic and you can even find online books that you can use, this is one way computers are a great thing out there are two other great reasons. Secondly, with computers the wole world becomes smaller as people begin to know more and more people through the computer. More than @PERCENT2 of people email, @CAPS2, or videochat on a daily baes. Isnt it great when you mnake a great friend in collage but you find out he/she lives halfway around the world, to know that you can still keep in touch with the computer, did you know that many people in the in the military use videochat to keep in touch with their loved one back home? Computers are great because they connect people and allow them to be together even when they cannot be together, but there is still one even better reason why computers are good. Finally, computers ofter many opportunities like education and jobs. Today there are many single parrents more than in any other time according to @ORGANIZATION1 and the number is still drastickly increasing with this economy some of those parrents could really use a better education to help them bring in more money for their familys, but when can they find time to go to school with work and then the kids? Now there are many online collage courses you can take to get the education you have always wanted with kraigslist and other online adds many people can post job ofering while others can email those people their resume to try to get the job, but by seeing adds posted online people can apply easier from farther away. Computers open many great oppertunities for people. Computers are very cool machines that many people take fergranted, they help give people information, as well as connect people from around the world and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 oppertunities. So @LOCATION1 Newspaper I hope you can try to understand my view on why computers are so great.",9
973,"Do you like your computer? Does it benifit you and the around you? People are saying that computers dont benifit people. I am writing to prove them wrong, and state why computers benifit us. It helps us with things like learning, communication, and even money or economic problems. First, learning is a very important in a lifetime and computers can help you increase that one hand-eye coordnation is very helpful in different sports like tennis, golf, and hackey too. When you go on the computer, you learn that skill. For example, last @DATE1 i went to tennis with mom and shes never on the computer. She missed every ball thrown to her. Thru computers all around the world, and going on the computer can open you to the whole world. You can see places like @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and even @LOCATION3. Overal, has the least computers out of the whole world. Finnaly, computers let you learn typing. In america, there are jobs that are for you to type. If you to type, then you a good job. If you get a good job, then you can be succesful in life. Computers definetly benifit your learning. Second, when. Computers open you up met new friends. One, when you go to school, more with other student. Computers let you talk your you right. According to facebook magazine, @PERCENT1 of all the students in a school chat and talk online to other person. Two, the computer can help you communicate with your family too for instance.

974,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion about computers is good. I think that they can help people with what they need. People can also also contact other people. All computers are helpful and not always something negative when someone uses it. Computers help teachers, students, employees, and parents. They aren't always for just helping. Computers can also be used for amusement. Games, music, and videos are always on the internet. Contacting other people is also a great reason why computers aren't bad. People can always have an e-mail for business and friends. Myspace, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 are all websites that people can contact others. Having a computer isn't always bad. When you do a story for the newspaper does it come out hand written? You also use the computer to do work. Computers aren't always bad. People have to learn to just limit their time. They can always be a positive affect on people when they need something. Information on anything is always on the internet. Computers have been used for decades and I think they will be used for many many more. Back then people used computers mostly for work. Now people of all ages can use it for all different kinds of things.",6
975,"@DATE1 @CAPS1 The @CAPS2, I believe that computers in today's society have a possitve affect on people. I believe this because if people use it for education purposes to chat, email, or to reasearch it does make a difference in peoples lives. If you use the computer for educational purposes like games, you could really learn a lot. For example, I help my sister with her multiplication on a math game we have. Also, I learned to type with type to learn @CAPS3. on my desktop computer at home. Many other people use it for these reasons too. They also might use it for typing a project or making a presentation. Others might only use it for chat and e-mail. These things can still benefit our society though. Using the computer for chat, such as, facebook, myspace, and twitter can also benefit our society today. These websites benefit us because we can meet new people, catch up with old friends, or even talk with carrent friends. also on @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION1, or @ORGANIZATION3 we can e-mail people instead of instant messaging them. For example, if you have something really big to say to someone you might want to write on email. If you just want to say hello you could use facebook, myspace, or twitter if you have an account. Computers do benefit our society today. All of the reasons in my letter support my position on wether or not computers benefit our society.",8
976,"Dear @LOCATION2, @CAPS1's the dillemant @CAPS2 that people are supporting computer technology and others are not. I firmly believe that having computers generally has a positive effect. This is because many jobs are using them everyday and it is very efficiant for them. Also, having computers allows people to connect with other people, edit things that other technology cannot, and play fun games, @CAPS3 effect that computers have is educational websites; games, and articals. This helps many kids find a good education and adults find a comfortable and happy job. Primarily. computers have a positive effect on people because jobs are using them frequently. Jobs such as @ORGANIZATION1 and any type of police work provide sarely for people all around the united states and other parts of the world. My father always told me, ""Computers save people everyday"". Even schools use computers! They provide educational information about the students in schools, and my school, @LOCATION1 school, uses them quite often. For example, I see my teacherm. Mr, @CAPS4 his computer every single movning in homeroom. Nearly @PERCENT1 of all jobs involve a computer by storing information or any other purposed fealuired. Would you want all those people to lose ther job because of their skills and techniques towards computer technology? I know I wouldn't, @CAPS5 keep in mind computers provide a safe and healthy life for many people. In addition, computers have a positive effect on people because they can do many things that nothing else can do. This is things like staying in town with someone far away, or editing photos. Even playing a game on the computer could ne relaxing to almost anyone. @CAPS6 is an example of keeping in town with someone else. For me, @CAPS6 is a life-saver. It allowed me to talk to my brother white he was at his chaotic college. In fact, nearly @PERCENT2 of people have an account on a computer of a public website live @CAPS7, @CAPS6, or @CAPS9. Computers keep photos saved that can be edited and even just saved to be admired. I don't want my pictures and my @CAPS6 deleted because nothing else competes with the mighty computer since it me have an enjoyable time and entertains me well. Thirdly, computers have a positive effect on people because they give aduts and kids tree access to education. I remenber my old elementery school used to play many amusing math games. These were @CAPS5 my education grew greatly dae to this game. Games as these are used frecquently thoughout the world. In addition jobs have been lost from this had economy. However, jobs we hering found more and more everyday from adults trying to find a decent job online. Computer saved people from losing their house because of the money they made with the help of computers, computers are a good idea To conclude. I imploor you that computer technology has a strong positive effect on people. Computers are like a pencil to a student. for they are very important. Jobs use them everyday, connections are made by people, and education grows because of them. That's why the technology or computers effects people in a good way.",11
977,"Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 well @CAPS1 many others, i believe computers are not only good, but beneficial. Computers are advanced our world little by little every day. We all use them for communication, entertainment, and knowledge. Computers are like people with fun to do and things to learn. Computers are beneficial to everyone worldwide. Computers gradually advance communication more and more everyday. It used to be old letters by mail, then it became e-mails, twitter, and facebook. These websites upgrage communication today. Long distance friends can view photos, information, videos, and chat from far away. Some site like @ORGANIZATION2 allow you to instant message your friends. Lastly, video chatting is a new improved way to see a live video of the other person. According to @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1 more user signed up for web-cams since the beggining of @DATE1. Communication is positively affected by computers. I know you @MONTH1 have fun with sports or nature, but sometimes it is great to get great entertainment for yourself instantly. Computer games only cost about @MONEY1 and are instant access. Also, surfing the web for news or funny videos is fun sometimes. Almost everyone who has a @CAPS2 gets a blast surfing the internet. Do you ever wonder how to hear the song you like when it's not on the radio? Itunes stores, organize, and plays music in a virtual library for permanent access. What also happens is youtube allows you to watch music videos or hear songs for free. Now thats why computers are straight entertainment. Finally, computers provide you with so much knowledge and is great for education. Certain websites let you access tons of knowledge. Wikipedia and diccionary.com are great for learning.",10
978,"Dear local newspaper, I'm writing because I've heard that some people think that computers are very useful and some people think their know good because people spend to much time on them, I think that there are good to have because, its ways to keep in touch with friends, to research the things your curious without going to the library having to look for the book you need. The computers are good to have because they can online that they dont have as a place to walk into or if they do its . I think it good to have computers because when your younger and no more friends you @MONTH1 have been really to them but you with them. You can email each other or search thru up online, to try to get in contact with them. Also if your family member is far away and you really cant talk on the phone of the money, then you can im them so you can talk without having to spend money. I also think its good to because if there's any problem with one to get to the library you can scan it up online. Also the computer is available all the time. The computer is good for doing homework you cant then always . I also think its good to have a computer if you need something but you cant afford it, usually if you go online you can find it and buy it save money, also some they have online aren't really an actual .

979,"Dear newspaper, I've read your article about peoples opinion on the affects of computers. I believe that having computers are a very good thing. With them we can talk to others from far away, and fast. You can learn a lot too. It also teaches hand-eye coordination. My first reason why they are good is because you ran talk to others. Without computers it would be almost impossible to meet people from far away and talk to them so easily. They even have webcams so you can see each other. You can use @CAPS1, @CAPS2, webcams, or even a simple comment on facebook or myspace. @CAPS2 or webcams are the quichest and maybe even coolest way. Secondly you can learn Computers have so many websites that give out alot of information and resent too. It's muchn easier to get on the internet and type something in then look threw a bunch of books.The internet has dictionaries, news stations, weather, history and where you can find things. With all that you dont even need books. They even have maps and you can print out directions. My final reason is because it teaches hand-eye coordination. When you first start using computers your normally pretty young, and sometimes you don't always type the fastest. Computers have become so advanced that there are even touch-screen and wireless mases. So when you first start you normaly look down to see what your writing, later, adults want you to look at the screen when that becames easy you know that your hand-eye coordination has grown alot better then when you stated. In conclusion I think that computers are a good part of everyday life and that there not bad. They are an easy communication between people, help you learn, and teach good and fast hand-eye coordination in kids.",8
980,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 @MONTH1 be true that computers @MONTH1 make people exercise less, enjoy nature less, and spend time with family and friends less but computers do benefit the society in many ways. Computers help students with homework and projects and they help communicate with other people. Besides the telephone, computers do have some bad things about them, too. Students need computers to help them complete homework and class projects. They help students create good presentations and students can use the internet for research. Having computers will help raise a students grades and help them have a more successful life in the future. Parents and kids can communicate long-distance friends and/or relatives and they can talk to co-workers, bosses, teachers of their kids, and with their own children/parents, too. Having computers would create more communication with some people and help keep in touch with family members. Besides all of the good things, computers do have bad qualities, too. They can lead to children seeing inapropriate sites, and maybe even a virus that crashes your computer! Most of the programs to get rid of viruses block children and adults from seeing inapropriate sites (like gambling, pornography, etc). We need a computer that is pre-installed with the best up-to-date virus protection system, that helps protect children, teens, and adults from viruses, inapropriate sites, and cyber-bullies. Having these will make a computer almost perfect! The computers everyone needs should help students learn, keep raising communication between people and be pre-uploaded with programs to protect people from viruses, bad websites, and cyber-bullies. Computers are needed, and without them, our lives would be extremely miserable.",8
981,"Can you imagine how difficult life would be without a computer? I can I believe computers are helpful. Computers help us do research they keep us connected with friends and family and they are required to be used at some @CAPS1. The internet is a easy way to do research. All you have to do is search what you want information on and millions of articles will be at the click of mouse. Using the internet on a computer is much easier than going through books looking for something. That could waste a lot of time. The internet can quickly and directly answer your questions. Computers are a great way to keep connected. Almost everyone has a email now. All you have to do is type a few letters and you'll be reaqquainted with a old friends. When you call someone you can't be sure if they are busy or not. When using email the person recieving the email can reply when they howe free time. Computers are used at many @CAPS1. Sometimes you're even required to use it. Computers organize data by keeping documents in different files computers also have valuable programs that could help you in your career. Such as @ORGANIZATION1 word. Using a computer would aid you financialy. Some of you might think computers have misleading information. The internet isnt always a honest place. By spending a few minutes double-checking your information on other websites, your still spending less time than it would take to find the fact in a book. The computer is one of the greatest inventions created. It makes research connecting with friends, and your @CAPS3 easy! Use a computers @DATE1 and your life will be changed for the better. ",8
982,"Dear editor, I understand that some children and adults love going on the computer, but they don’t know what the bad effects are. When your at a young age, anything can happen, while your on the computer, even worse things can happen. You could do bad things over the internet, won't exercise, or have time for your family. First of all, what I mean by bad things I mean, your child can go on bad websites, talk to strangers, or get harassed. When a child first gets, for example, a facebook account, most of the times the people who request them as a friend are unregistered child molesters and or sex offenders. They would probably act friendly to get the kid comfortable then they would end up kidnapping them. Also you could harass people or get harrassed yourself. And you can go on inapropriate websites. Secondly, you act enough generation child I go outside basically, it all kids. Lastly, your child won't have family time. Now with more technology coming out like cellphones, and laptops; kids would rather hang out with their friends and not with the families. I could understand the whole cellphone thing but you need to make more time for your family. The reason I think going on the computers all the times not good because you can do bad things by talking to strangers, harrassment, and you can go on inappropriate websites. you won't get enough exercise and you can suffer from diabetes, high and childhood obesity. Lastly, you won't have enough family times mainly because of all of the new technology that has come out such as cellphones and laptops.",9
983,"Dear @CAPS1, A recent study by scientists shows that too much sitting down, especially in front of computers is dagerous to health. This is only one reason why I think that, although they are useful, computers are not entirely beneficial to our society. The hinder us from excersising, interacting with nature, and spending time with family and friends. Excercising, as we all know, is necessary to remain as a fit and health human being. But how is this possible with some people going to work everyday and getting shut in their offices at their computers all day. Too much computer time even for kids, can lead to obesity and overweightness. Also, like I mentioned before scientists have concluded asked, that too much sitting is bad for you. It isn't how the body was built to work. If you have seen wave, one of @ORGANIZATION1's most recent movies, undertaking is easy. The humans in that movie, after relying on computers for so long, became obese and fat and had no muscle. This is an of course, but minor visions of this are going around the world. Going out do instead of sitting a computer is a sure way to healthy. The next thing that computers restrict us in is our ability to experience nature. Even simulations don't cut it. If you wanted to see a frog or of some other animal, can't just @ORGANIZATION2 it, look for it in the real. Developing a connection to nature can really nurture the use of that is and ill. Instead of exploring a computer, explore the world as we know it until it's or you're too old. Learn how to do somthing by. Instead of hiring someone to make at, make it yourself. Do it to learn it, sit at a computer website to hire someone! Get up and get outside! As you become more dependent on your computer, you become less dependent on family and friends. It causes there to be a lift between family members. Your family might not be able to help you when you're in need. If you're an adult, and you're on the computer all the time for something other than work, then your not supporting your family, you have no income, no life, and no future. Why would anyone do this to themselves? Imagine this!:You have nothing except your laptop. You're a , on and have family relations. Nobody wants to be that kind of loser living on the streets! You have nobody and nothing except for your computer, and you've wasted your life away. Too much time on your computer means that everyone suffers. To sum it all up, computers maybe, but every single cloud has a dark lining. Computers stop us from exercising, interacting with nature, and being with our families. So get outside!",10
984,"Dear: @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think computer are one of the most @CAPS3 inventions ever. They help education make everything @CAPS4 and traveling is @CAPS4. It helps education because @CAPS5 always use computers to help kids learn important information. for example if we have to study for something there are websites specialy made for studing. Also there are sites to teach little kids how to read or write. Allmost all @CAPS5 have computers these days. Some @CAPS5 even give computers to kids so they can use it to study. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 in the @CAPS7.S use computers more than textbooks and get high test scores. Thats why computers help education. A second reason is it generally makes everything @CAPS4. For example instead of writing an essay for school and having it take hours than your hand is and to findout its filled with miss-spelled words. Instead you can type it quick and use spell check. I have never heard one person say that the computer hasn't make life @CAPS4. Another example is if you had to find some information on you new dog. Instead of goind to your library spending minutes.You can simply open up you internet and then search it and find the info you need in seconds. That's why the computer make every thing @CAPS4. The last reason is that one. Traveling is such a without a computer With out it you have to go to to buy tickets. In fact I don't even remember what it was like to not @CAPS9 online with a computer all you have to do is go to the parts websites and then but it from there its so easy areselfs to places but traveling mail to each other also. I haven't sent a @CAPS8 card in years. Instead I @CAPS9 email. It quicker, @CAPS4 and more reliable. That is why traviling people and mail is @CAPS4. Over all the computer is one of the most helpful things ever and with technology upgraing daily soon it will be even @CAPS4 to do things. While too much computer is bad and people souldn't @CAPS9 interact with internet. The computer games in handy almost all the time. That is why i think the computer is @CAPS3.",8
985,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 the men and women who write everyday for a living, I would like @CAPS2 you were to write rection on computers. They teach @LOCATION3 faraway places, help build hand-eye coordination, and let @LOCATION3 talk online. Computers are part of everyday life and needs to be told about. First, computer let @LOCATION3 learn about faraway places without leaving the rooms. One of my mom's friends, They decide to move to @LOCATION2 she didn't like computer so didn't look at @LOCATION2's laws saying, I'll find out when I got there. ""@CAPS2 did find out the laws she didn't find enough cause cause she was arrested multiple times in her first few years. A few monthes after her last arrest she came back to the @LOCATION3 where she could deal with the laws. @LOCATION2 is a buetifull country and all of arrests were accidents because she didn't know the laws. Ten minutes on computer searching the laws in @LOCATION2 could have kept her in @LOCATION1. Next, comptures improve hand-eye coordination. From a survey @PERCENT1 of children that spend more time on computers are better at tennis, and at baseball then others. @PERSON3, a gym teacher at the @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""@CAPS3 of these kids that spend time on the compture are weak and need to get some exercise.Dear local newpaper: @CAPS1 you being the local newspaper, you have the power to say how you feel about the effects computers give to people. I believe that computers give great effects to people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it allows you to talk to people. In all, @PERCENT2 of people agree with my idea about computers. Firstly, using computers teaches people about hand-eye coordination. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. In all, computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more. Secondly, computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places. @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 quotes, ""I always use computers for my work because it helps me learn about many new things. @CAPS5, it lets my wife and I search details about a trip we want to go on."" @CAPS5, the people agree with what @PERSON2 stated. However, people @MONTH1 say that computers give the wrong information many times, but @CAPS2 you find a wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirly, @CAPS2 you use computers it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because @CAPS2 you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then video chat. It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way. @CAPS5, instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes, go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat. Lastly, taking to people and being active in other peoples life is important. In conclusion, you will have great eye coordination, you will be able to research faraway places, and you will always be allowed to video chat or talk to family online. @CAPS5, I want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem. Lastly, you will have the best feeling ever @CAPS2 you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot! From so many students having greater hand-eye cooridination they will enjoy what their good at like tennis. @PERSON1, a professor of the human body at @ORGANIZATION1 states ""Technology helps hand-eye. Many who use computers more than others to be greater at @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and games along those lines."" This shows how hand-eye and exercise is linked to computer. Furthermore, computers help @LOCATION3 talk with other people. When a child goes to college they will still be able to email their famlies and talk to them. Talking with others by computers makes the world go round. World business need computers to contact eachother to decuss plans on how to move toward economicly. Lastly, computers are useful and should be useful more. They teach @LOCATION3 of faraway places, improve hand-eye coordnation, and let @LOCATION3 talk to other people. @CAPS2 an article is made to show the pros or computers, more people will experience the wonders of them.",10
986,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 society should have computers because it teaches you things that a school or job will never teach you, and it allows you to be in contact with your friends and family that you don't see a lot. I would like for you to appreciate my concern on how @CAPS1 society should have computers. First, we should have computers because it teaches us things that we might not have been taught before. I say this because if you wanna know about the @LOCATION1 more and the school or job doesn't teach you as much as you wanna know, then all you have to do is look up on the internet and theres a chance you gonna find it. @NUM1 people would rather have computers to look up things instead of not knowing that much about something at all. Next, we should have computers for @CAPS1 society because we could contact people online that we heven't spoke to. My opinion is that if you haven't to a friend or family member in a while you can talk to them online. Also, if they don't have a phone or if they do but it's long distance and you can't talk to long distance on your phone, you can tlak to them on or email each other, etc. Sample say if your phone isn't working and the only thing that's working is your computer you to it in contact with somebody. All you gotta do is talk to them online. Would you rather talk on the phone or computer. In conclusion, @CAPS1 society should have computers because we could learn about things more and we could chat with people. I would like for you to aprreciate my concern on having computers in @CAPS1 society.",7
987,"Dear @STATE1 news, Computers are a great machine to use. People can research, learn about any topic or subject and let people talk to friends online I think that computers have a good effect on people. Computers are one of the great inventions we have. They are very helpul in our everyday life. When people need to write a paper for school or do a project you can research what you need if you need to know some thing about, a topic that you don't know about, you can look up questions you have about it on the internet. If your writing a paper and need an answer its all on the internet. Suppose you want to go on a family vacation to california you can plan your whole trip right on your computer, you can book a flight, get a hotel room and even see what there is to do you can see the whole world right from your computer. If you want to learn another language you can learn an entire language on your computer. Also if your to busy to go to collage or want to take another class there are even schools online. The computer is a great way to learn about new things. Finally you can talk to friends online websites like facebook and myspace are great ways to keep in touch with your friends. naother positive way is @CAPS1 you can instant message friends and family without having to wait so long for a response back. If you want your friends you can just message them. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. They are helpul in many ways such as people can do research, learn about new things and talk to friends I hope, you see my point at view they are samething everyone should have.",8
988,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you see, owning a computer can effect you. Having a computer can make you have lazy behavier, can @CAPS2 you from being indoors, and can @CAPS2 you inside so you dont hang out with family and friends. Everyone loves having a computer, but have you ever thought what it can do to you? Spending all day or even half your day on the computer will make you lazy. When your lazy or becoming lazy you dont want to do anything, and without doing anything you can become overweight. So, you need exersize because it's good for you and exersizing can protect you from health problems such @CAPS1 diebities. Get off your computer, and go for a walk. Why would anyone want to be indoors on a computer when you can go enjoy what nature posses. Being so drawn to your computer can @CAPS2 you indoors instead of breathing fresh, clean air which is outside. Being outside can be lots of fun too. You can go swimming or even have a picnic in your local park. When your outside you can also see all the breathtaking scenery, wild animals, and exotic plants and flowers that live among us. If you just go outside for atleast an hour a day you'll see fore sure how much better it is than being on a computer. Staying on the computer for too long can @CAPS2 you from what realy matters, your friends and family. Why talk on the internet to a friend when you can meet up with them and do something fun? Friends and family are realy important and if you don't spend time with them they can become upset. Being with friends and family are supposed to be the best moments of your life, so dont spend them on the computer. Go call up a friend and do something fun, I hope by now you understand that being on the computer or having one is not the best idea. Having a computer can make you lazy, @CAPS2 you from enjoying nature, and can have you not spend time with family and friends. If everyone got off the computer for at least a hour a day they'll live a happier, healthier life. So, turn off your computer get off your couch, and enjoy your life.",8
989,"Dear local newspaper, People spend to much time on the computer. Instead of exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with real people they sit down and play games and watch music or movies on the computer. There fore I do not agree with people who say computers benifit the society. @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1. A lot of peoples skin is jiggily and fat because of computers. @CAPS5 you @MONTH1 ask? People sit in front of there computers all day when they could spend that time exercising, my dad got extremly over weight when we got a new computer. All he did was sit and play games like @CAPS1 wars or @CAPS2. I couldn't beleive @CAPS5 fat he got so my mom told him and now instead of playing on the computer he goes to the gym. You wouldn't beleive @CAPS5 much weight he lost. Also did you know that america is one of the fatist countrys because people don't exercize and just play on ther laptops and computers. So it would help america alot to stop playing softwear and start exersizing. So many people miss out on the butiful works of nature. The cool relaxing air at the beach is much nicer than a dark stuffy room with just the glow of a computer. There's so much to discover so much to be explored. So yes you could find the gisers in yellow stone online but it's nothing like seeing in real life. If there were computers back in the early @DATE1's people would never had the earge to find new land, you don't hear of many great explorers now do you? I bet if every one took a break from computer new spicies would be found or maybe even a cure for canser. Who knows what you can do if you step out of the box and into the buitful part of nature. ""@CAPS3 come down and talk to your grand parents."" ""@CAPS4 mom I'm playing on the computer!"" @CAPS5 many times has this happend to you?

I know a kid named @PERSON2 who was playing on the computer when his friend called and invited him over. @PERSON2 said @CAPS4. His friend was so disiponded and angry. I would be too. Whould you like to have a friend pick computer over you? I'd hope not. There fore computers hurt and are not as good as real people. In conclusion qualiy time with people, nature, and exercize is more important than a glowing box. I hope you agree the computers do not always help society.",10
990,"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that people should stay with computers. I have three reasons for this issue and they are @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. I think these reasons woul'd be a good for this issue because every human being can do these three this on a computer. One of the reasons why I think people should stay to computers is because they can learn. People can learn by using computers because if a child is in something like animals. They can go on the internet and look up what they need to find children can also learn on the computer by putting their jump stat first grade give in the drive. children can learn like this. My second reason why people should use stay to computers us @CAPS2. I think @CAPS2 because you can talk to your friends about. They can also talk about if they want to go some fun. For example same good exercise. Another reason why I think @CAPS2 is if your friend is explaining something to you, that your. I also think @CAPS2 can be had for other to a and. The last reason why I believe people should stick to computer is because people can discover different things on there these things can be had and some can be good. For example a good thing that I can discover is that if there is something wrong with my computer and I figure out how to fix this that would be good. And I will know about computers and man what to do. A bad thing about @CAPS3 the computer I can do is bringing up a virus. That know matter what I do I can't make it go away and the computer ends up being broken. Conclusion, Local newspaper this is why I believe that we should keep our computers. Because many people even young children can learn and they will end up remembering the things that they learn.",8
991,"I believe computers aren't having a positive effect on people in this time period for some people they’ve really taken over their lives. There are many health concerns that take place in a generation full of computers. Also there is less time in your schedule for more important things when you're adicted to facebook. Also money will always be less when computers come along! Computers can really be dangerous to you health! For example all that typing can lead to arthritis in the hands and fingers in the long run. Did you know, more seizure are induced by compexors than epileptics? Dr. @LOCATION1 is as saying ""People don't cause obesity, computers do"" @CAPS1 also thinks that the majority of the obeisity is caused by an addiction to computer games. Ever been depressed than taken a long nature walk, and felt great? Well a lot of people tell on rely on thier computer when they're down. Computers usually make things worse. When on twitter, facebook, google and you tube all the time its hard to find time for even the most important things. For example if you're a parent your child might feel abandonned if you start caring about the computer more than very little time spent together could turn them to alchohol or smoking. I let you never of a computer like that! Computer can be good way to wind down but they can also become an addiction there when youre addicted to sitting on a computer you forget about the beauty of nature! Money can also contribute to the addiction. For example shopping addictions are a good way to blow money because it's so easy. All you have to do is type in a credit card number which gives you the illusion that youre not spending money, until the bill comes! Another thing is kids websites like webking which you need to pay for you also need to pay for internet and the electricity bill. It's clear to see that computers cause nothing but health problems, less time in your daily schedule and the money out of you pocket. To me computers are just a trouble in our lives.",9
992,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 have come very far with technology. Computers and other gadgets have helped us go farther. But the computer is one gadget that does not benefit society. My reasons for this are when you are on a computer you could be cyber bullied. My next reason is that when you stay on too long you miss out on stuff like being with family. The last reason why computers do not benefit society is when you type on a computer the spell check on @CAPS3 checks spelling and puncuation and grammar so you don't learn from your mistakes. These reasons support me in saying computers haven't really benefited society. Firstly, my first reason for saying that computers have not benefited society is you can get cyberbullied. For instance somebody goes home and checks their email. They get threatening emails. They are scared what do they do. Cyber bulling, being induced by computers, is the easiest way to bully somebody. You can make them feel bad without doing anything besides typing a message. All you really have to do is find out somebodys email. Also cyber bulling could be anybody. Some one you knkow or someone you don't. computers haven't helped in society by inducing more crimes. Next my reason is if you stay on too long you miss out on life. Between checking email accounts and updating @CAPS4 the average person spends @PERCENT1 of their day on the computer. People who spend that much time on the computer miss things. My sister always come, out asking questions in the middle of the conversation because she's following and updating on @CAPS4 while @CAPS2 are having a conversation. People miss things while on the computer. Lastly, when you are typeing an essay or something you don't learn anything about grammar or spelling because spellcheck checks it for you. Most teenagers in @LOCATION1 when texting don't use proper grammar or spelling. So they can write an essay in text language and when typing it over students choose what they mean from spellcheck and move on. This is unacceptable because students must learn proper grammar and spelling. This is reducing students thinking levels just above read and click the awnser. If computers did everything for us @CAPS2 would be mindless slugs quick. In conclusion I think computers have not benefited society. Computers inducieng cyberbulling. When you type spellcheck corrects your mistakes so you don't learn and people miss stuff when on the computer. Computers have not helped society for all of these reasons and more. Computers should be used less.",8
993,"Dear Local Newspaper, I am awair that more people use computers everyday. I think that computers does have a positive effect on adults and their children. Computes help us by giving information about things in othe contries, states, and towns. It also can help children with school homework. Last thing is that it helps you communicate with friends and family members that live to far of a distance where you cant see them. Computers gives information about the latest and most recient things that happen in other towns contries, and states. If you needed to find out something that happened about @NUM1 years ago or more you wouldn'@CAPS1 see it on @CAPS1.V., you would be able to find it on the internet. Without the internet you wouldn'@CAPS1 find the things you was looking for. Another thing that computers is very useful for is helping kids with homework and school work. If your work is typed then your work is neater and more understandable. I can understand why some parents wouldnt want their kids on the computer doing homework. They might start doing something else or get answers for something they can do without the computer. But using the computer with homework and school work will make it where you can make sure your work is correct. Last, computers can help you correct with friends and family members. If you have friends and family that you want to reconnect with the computer can help you find information about where they are located. That @MONTH1 not be good for people who are trying to stalk or abuse someone. But in other cases like be unite with family can be very helpful. This can make families keep in touch and friend close. What are some of your feelings about computers. Some people @MONTH1 dislike them but they have good reasons why. More family time can be but I think you can make time for the computer and other things like family time and exercising. Well my time is up here. Hope you liked what I said here and you'll have a passion for computers.",9
994,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 personal experience, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Many people enjoy their time on the computer because, with today's technology so many things can be done and quicker too. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have a computer at home. I do and its just great. I got most things done and in a matter of time. I think computers have a positive effect on people because today you can do almost anything. For example, I have family in @LOCATION2; @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION4, and instead of calling them on the phone, I could video chat with them and it feels like you're actually there. Also, now you can pay your bills online, and instead of sending a letter through mail and waiting when it will arrive and having to buy stamps that are extremely expensive, you could just simply send on e-mail-free of charge. Most college students do their homework on the computer. They type essays, or while doing research on someone or something, they could just save it and take notes on it later. So basically a computer is almost a part of everyone's life and it can be entertaining, fun, and used for more important things. What I'm trying to say is computers are a part of every teenagers routine during the day. We like to interact with our friends and listen to music and bond with family and other realtives who you don't usually contact all on one piece of technology. Some people even go to school over the computer and get a degree in something. Computers are important, a computer will scan this test of mine and give me a score, so I think now you will agree with me now when I say computers have had and always will have a positive effect on people. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my opinion and I hope you agree.",9
995,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1? Are you there?"" ""@CAPS2 you hear me?"" You never have that issue with computers. It has come to my understanding that there is a dispute about the benefits of computers - should we have them and advance them, or not? Well, I believe that computers are a necesity to an average person. Computers help everyone, and make life easier! Sure, there are cellphones and other helpful electronics, but @CAPS2 they always prove trustworthy? Computers are alwasy reliable - whether it's for homework or another reason! Computers provide easy interaction without breakups, they make it easier to learn, and if you are smart then they are safe. Without computers, who knows where our society would be? To begin, computers allow people to have conversations with others...that are halfway across the world! There are a variety of applications that you @CAPS2 choose from, and they are all easy to use. My personaly preffered option is @ORGANIZATION2 email. I myself have family in @LOCATION1, which is a whole continent away! Sure, I could call them, but my phone bill would be through the roof! How else am I supposed to keep intact with my loved ones? Do you know how many others face the same problem? Through a recent study, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 families in @LOCATION2 say they have relatives that are far away. That is @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's population! Imagine there was no computer for them to use. Phone companies would be in money and regular families would be living on the streets. Or worse - they would lose any relationship with their famly. Do you want that? Computers are easy to access, and you @CAPS2 interact with loved ones, friends, or new people. It doesn't get any better than that! So, which would you choose - losing your family relations or keeping in touch via email and computer applications? If that isn't enough, computers make it easy to learn new things and accomplish tasks. I know that as a student of @PERSON1, other students and I need to type our homework at least three times a week! Just yesterday I had to type up a response, a free writing choice, and an entry for a history project. Imagine if we had to go back to using typewriters. Either homework wouldn't be done or everyone would have a major lack of sleep. Both options are unacceptable. Plus, computers are great for research. If you have to look up a new country, look at far away colleges or find out about the world, why not visit your handy computer? You could learn which college is right for you without leaving your house. You could visit a new country without leaving town! Sure, you could read a newspaper, but answer me this where does the paper come from? Yup, trees are killed for them. Computers are the easy, environment friendly alternative for you. If those two reasons didn't convince you, maybe this one will. Most people think computers are unsafe, and that @MONTH1 be partly true. But if you are smart or listen in school like me, you will know that isn't always the case. In our school, we are taught about the risks of computers, and how to prevent any possible @CAPS3. I'm sure most schools do. In fact, nine out of ten students say that when it comes to safety, computers are rated an A+. Everyone knows about hackers, and so we avoid them. My parents even say that for over thirty years they have never had a single issue or risk of safety when using a computer, and neither have I. ""@CAPS3 are only powerful if you let them be, and let them take control,"" says @CAPS4, an expert on the subject. So, if it's safety you are worried about, then don't. The kids of today, and tomorrow, know what is out there, and how to stop the minor @CAPS3. So, why don't we recap what we learned today. Are computers helpful and the best way to go for communication? Yes, they are. What is the best way to learn now things easily? I believe the correct answer is computers. What are safe even if some don't agree. It wasn't phones... no, not television... oh yes computers! I see why you might think no, they should be outside, well let me tell you, cellphones and t.v. will keep them from that anyway. At least computers don't rot your brain. Well, I have done my part. I support computers, and their advancement. But it isn't up to me, is it? No, it's not. So please do your part by spreading the word. It's the right thing to do. You know that you want to!""",12
996,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 you think the computers don't help you with research? Well, if you really think about it computers @CAPS1 help you. You can't always gain wait by just looking or staying on a computer. And you can defenetly still talk with kids, friends, and family members on computer. @CAPS1 you no if books have all the information you need for school project, or your own family history. Maybe books have our history of wars and of our heros. Try and see if you can find the first ancestor of your family. The computer are the reasons why we no our history and know about actors, slaves, sergents, and much more. Have you gain weight just from staying on the computer for too long. I haven't gain a pound or an ounce since I've been on computer. Not only can you gain weight or lose weight just by being on the computer. How @CAPS1 you know if the person on the computer is not looking for diet foods or fat free things? Or if the person is eating while being on the computer. @CAPS1 you get large phone bills just for a two minute long distance call? Why @CAPS1 you think we have enternet websites such as myspace, facebook, twitter, msn and lots more. Most of my family members life in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4, and @LOCATION2 and just for a call its like ten dollars for a minute. While you can be on the internet for about day to night and still pay the same price. So what @CAPS1 you choose pay over thirty dollars just for a long distance call or stay on the computer. Or get bad grades for doing the bad research. Its you chooce, choose now if either talk with family and friends on phone and pay over your bill money or stay on web chat for how long you want and still get the same bill price.",8
997,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I believe it is true many people use computers and that many more will use them in the future. Computers are a standard of the buissnes world and are hevily depended on. People are even needing internet access on cellphones to stay up to date on stocks, shipments and important emails. Some computers are also just for at home use and are used to contact family members and find information that you @MONTH1 need instantly or wouldn't be able to find any were. Computers are still developing and are becoming faster and better day after day and most likely will never be put out of use but then does not mean they will permanently restrict you from othere activeties. It is true some people do spend to much time on computer but not everyone does, some people work from home computer and can not help being on it because it is their job. I implore you to consider the resonse computers are used so much and to understand that computers are used to help not hurt people. Computers are very helpfull in simplying things and are very useful for information. I stand strong with the use of computers and strongly disagree that they negatively affect hte way of human life. Computers do th things people would normaly not do for example someone would not go and look up every thing he or she needs to know in a look because there be only certain facts there looking for and it would also be easy to compare and contrast information on a computer rather than reading several diferent books. So if you truly think about it computers save us a tremendus amount of time with the things we do. Once again I say ""computers better owe life not hurt it.""",8

999,My experience with commputer's is good because I can play games or do my homework. I can install my own music on my commputer and do my homework at the same time. I can also go on the internet with commputer's. On commputer's I can also do things quicker and easyer. I can also get more things done faster by getting the internet and going on it because I can do reaserch and copie and past stuff off the internet. I now have a labtop and it is preaty much portble commputer. On my labtop and it is preaty much poratble commputer. On my labtop I can make data tables and graph's and write papers and use dial up connection. Dial up connection is what I can use to get free internet by putting a presons phone number in the place were the phone number goes the labtop will call up the motem if the phone line is connected to the motem. On my labtop I also have a place to put a floppy disc in and a place for a @CAPS1-@CAPS2 to go in to. I also have a calculator on my labtop. some labtop's also have a mouse that looks like a little pad like mine dose. As you can see commputer's and labtop's are realy good to own.,6
1000,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, it has come to my attention that more and more people use computer, but not everyone agrees that this benefits the society. I strongly believe that computers do benefit society for three reasons. First, computers are a great source to do school work on. Computers let you learn more information. In addition, computers are a great way to keep in touch with friends and family. Clearly you can see why computers have positive effects on people and society. My first reason why I believe computers benefit society is because computers are a great source to use do school work with. An example of this would be if a science teacher gave their class an assainnment to do that had to be typed. Its impossible to type an essay without a computer. Further more, if the project or assignment needs to have information looked up and their is no time in your day to go to a library, the computer is a great source. Now doesn't that make sense? Computers don't just help you with homework, but many people go to college online also. My parents don't have enough money to afford me to go to college, ""says @NUM1-year old @PERSON1,"" so I take free course online and they work great! ""@CAPS1 it obvious that computers have a good effect on people? In addition to schoolwork, computers are a great place to look when you need information. For example, you have just bought a new house and want to know more about that area. The computer is an great place to look at updated pictures, and learn about your new hometown. Sixty-nine percent of people use information from the computer to buy a home. People @MONTH1 also want to learn basic information about bears or bees is my belief that the computer is a great source to do learn infromation obviously, computers have a great effect on people and it benefit society. Lastly, computers are helpful ways to keep in touch with family and friends. ""I have my whole mom's side of the family living in @LOCATION1. When I get to use the computer to keep in touch with them. I feel closer and part to keep in touch with them. i feel closer and part of one big happy family,"" @PERSON2 of @STATE1, @NUM2, says. People who have family living in other states, countries and even other countries, don't get to see eachother every day of the year @CAPS2 is why computers can help, the people keep in touch. Another example would be if your mom or dad went away for a few days, weeks or months and you wanted to talk to them of ten. A good way to do that would be using email or instant messaging. Therefore, i strongly believe that computers are great for people and do benefit the society. to sum it all up, computers benefits society and have possitive effects on people. Computers are great sources to do school work, they give you information your looking for, and are great ways to keep in touch with family and friends. Clearly you can see why I strongly believe that computers have a strong and possitive effect on people and benefit the society. Thank you!",10
1001,"Dear Local Newspaper, my opinion on the effects computers have on people is that I think the computer is good for people not great but its good for many reasons, for now I have three reason why its good, my reasons are, search new places meet new people, when people have nothing to do, and teenagers that cant be without the computer. My first reason is about searching new places and meeting new people. People that have computers can go on google and search for a place they want to go and there they meet new people and that way they dont have to be on the computer that much they will be too busy with their new friends. My second reason is when people have nothing to do. If people have nothing to do they can always invite friends over and on the computer they watch movies without going to the movie theater and they dont have to pay. All you could do is download it. And also thre are many websites of movies. My last reasong is about how teenagers cants be without the computer. teenagers are teenagers they must have technology. If yu take the computer away from them they went do enything else. That will be even worse because if you tell them to go outside they wont do it same will. Maybe what you can do is let them use the computer but they can use it outside only if its a laptop. This is my opion on the effects computers have on people.",8
1002,"Although most people would say the invention of a computer is a good thing, I dissagree. There are many bad things about the invention of computers, they give access to the internet. The internet has innappriate pictures and writing, unclear identification, and games. The worst of all is that on the internet, there is always unclear indentification. Although something on a social website such as @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 might say a person is fourteen years old, @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 might be someone that had just been released from prison and is actually fourty years old. There is never a way to know if its safe to talk to other people on the internet. Games on the internet are also very bad. Games are one of the causes or obesity in america. Also, games on the internet cause kids to be drawn away from their families. Another reason of why games are bad is because you can become addicted to them, and stare at a computer screeen so long you get eye-strain. There are also innapropriate pictures and writing on the internet. There is bomb making websites and illegal music downloading websites. Overell, computers are for researching but aren't reliable in safety and cause obesity nad family aruements.",7
1003,"I think that the computers are good to be used because anybody can use them at anytime or go on it whenever they want to. The reason why I think it is good is because you can contact someone that you know and talk to them whenever you want. Another reason is because you can play games or look for something or even make a research on stuff that you want to know or about something that you were always curious about. A computer is also usefull for better things like using it for when going to work or when a kid in school needs to do a report of project and needs to do it in typing and also to save stuff that you don't want nobody to use. Computers can sometimes be helpfull to people that really need it and that actually need to use it, but it can also be a fun activity to do if anybody doesnt have nothing to do. I think that the computer is awsome because anybody enough can open up their own website and create something what. A lot of people can go on the internet and open an account on a website; for example a @CAPS1 or a @CAPS2 or a @CAPS3 for that what to have an account. These are a lot of people that use the computer in a good way and use it for things that it can actually be used for. So I think that the computers are avery helpfull to people that like seaching for stuff that there curious about or to have to use it for good needs.",7
1004,"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 in your newspaper, I read an article that sparked my interest. The article was about the negative effects computers have on the community. I couldn't help but disagree with the article, @PERSON1 because, in my opinion, computers are a step in the right direction for modern technology. I believe computers are a benefit to society because they premote hand-eye coordination, you can learn about almost anything, and you can talk online to other people. How do computers help with hand-eye coordination, you ask? When you are typing on the computer your eyes are on the screen while your hands are typing and strengthening at an incredible rate! A study made by students at @ORGANIZATION1 shows that the chances of developing arthritis by the time you are @NUM1 dropped almost @PERCENT1 in people that use computers often. Also, the hand-eye coordination you get from typing, goes a long way in sports such as tennis and baseball. So if someone needs to build up their hand eye coordination I suggest that they take a computer class, like the ones that are offered in many schools all over the country. Secondly, using the internet on computers makes finding information on a variety of subjects much easier. Say you wanted to go on vacation with your family. Instead of calling a number, why not go online and plan your entire trip from your computer. There are so many websites that make it fast and easy. In addition, sites can teaching people how to clothings are always nearby. If you wanted to learn how to knit, just type in ""how to knit"" in your favorite search engine and there are over @NUM2 sites to help you, making it easy to learn to make a great or fix a bike. In addition to learning about new things the internet allows you to friends. After camp, I would always say ""oh we will keep in touch,"" but I never would be able to keep any promise. Once I found an instant messager or webcam application on the internet, it was very easy to talk to my friends. Every once in a while I talk to my friend who now lives in @LOCATION1! Also, my dad is always stressed about meetings with other countries, but now that he can use webcams to talk to his other international bosses, he is so excited about his meetings. He always says that the computers nowadays are very easy to use for talking to people. In conclusion, I believe that computers are a benefit to the world because they help with hand-eye coordination, make it easy to get information, and talk to people.",11
1005,"School, family, and sports is @CAPS5 my always tells me. Kids now a days live on the computer. @PERCENT1 of students get out of school and go straight to the computer. Students should spend more time with their families, they should exercise more, and lastly focus more on their grades in school. My initial reason why I agree is because most kids never spend time with their families. All kids like to came home and sit on the computer all day. This is terrible because kids never get to spend time with family and do not show appreciation for @CAPS5 their parents do for them. For example I just want to ask young kids do they thank their parents everyday? The reason I want to ask that is because they should be doing that everyday. In addition my second reason on why I agree is because students need to put more time and effort into school. Kids need to stop spending hours on facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Instead of going on those websites they should be on a website such as @ORGANIZATION1 do research. @PERCENT2 of students that go to school either have facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. For example everyday I walk the halls I over hear students talking about @CAPS5 happen of the computer @TIME1. It's ridiculous how many student do not complet their homework and hand it in late. Lastly my third and final reason on why I agree is because student absolutely do not exercise. A famous baseball player once said ""you don not have to be strong, but you have to be fit and athletic."" @CAPS5 this meant was that you had to be in shape. @PERCENT3 of students are not at their weight they should be at because they are obeast and do not exercise. The only exercise students get now a days is their @CAPS6.E. class. Even then students get tired quick and get out of breathe because they are lazy and always on the computer. They need to get off the computer and do push ups, sit ups, and just exercise. For example everyday I get out of school I do my homework and I go run a mile. To add on to the students need to pass there @CAPS6.E. class. In conclusion students should not spend so many hours on the computer and spend time with their family, as well as focusing on their school grades, and lastly they need to get off the computer and exercise more and stay healthy!",9
1006,"In my opinion having computer is good to have. Therefore I think having computers are a good thing because nowadays computers are very useful. Also a lot of people are using the for there businesses. My there reasons are to look up information, home work, and to talk to friends and family online. My first reason is to look up information on the computer. If you have thred reports to do it will best to use a computer to look up the information because it will be easier and faster to do. For an example using the internent will be faster then looking for it in a book. For that it will take at least @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes for the interenant if you were to lookingit in a book it can take at least @NUM3 to @NUM4 minutes. My second reason is to you could talk to your friends and family online like if one of your relatives live long distance like in @LOCATION2 then you can talk to them on your telephone or cellphone because the bill will outragouse. Or if you talk to your friends online so can ask them a question on homework or whats the homework? Like if you have a that to like @LOCATION1 you can to online and you can talk to them. My third reason is that you can even do your homework on the computer. If you have history you can go on a website for an online book instead of bringing a book to school and back to home. Also it will be easier for that you would not have to worry about bringing your history book with to home. For the example it will take less time using the interneat the using a book it will take like @NUM5 to @NUM2 minutes using the computer then using the book for @NUM5 to @NUM8 minutes. In my conclusion using a computer is very useful and very important nowadays. My three reasons are to look up information, homework and talking online to friends and family. Even though people don't like computers or don't like to use them.",8
1007,"Dear @CAPS1 news editors, @CAPS2, my name is @PERSON1, and I would like you to write an article on the effects computers have on people. Computers have been the technological item to have over the past @NUM1 or so years. They allow people to learn many new skills, get important work done, and even socialize! However some experts believe that people spend to much time on computers, and that people are not as active or healthy because of it, and. Everyone wants to be healthy. While computers are fun and useful, could they have a negative effect on society? @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are employed as of @DATE1, and with that number dropping people need to get more work done to keep their jobs, or even keep their businesses open. With computers available at work (or school) much more work can be done, with programs like @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 people can type reports, and with programs like @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2, and iCalculator, workers can calculate taxes faster, so they have more time to work. Some people are working with stocks, and these days, the stocks could be good or bad, so you need to keep up! You can go to the stock websites and control what you buy and sell, without raising you phone bill from calling the brokers. Laptops make work possible on the go to! Computers teach many skills you need to know for jobs, and other skills you @MONTH1 need times in life. You can learn typing, work programs, and programing which are all needed in some lines of work. Computers increase math skills and hand eye coordination to! And you can read your favorite books via online scans!, now you @MONTH1 be wondering why not pick up a real book? Well, you can’t online scans, and some are free! Not only do computers teach skills and work, they are very fun too! Between @CAPS6, twitter, email, googleBUZZ, mySpace, ooVoo, skype and gamesradar, there are lots of ways to talk to friends and meet new people. On @CAPS6 I can have up to @NUM2 people talk to whenever I want! Why not talk to real people? you ask, well the answer is simple, maybe it is a lazy @DATE2 and nobody wants to go out anywhere, or maybe your friends want to talk right before bed time. Talking to real people is important, but can’t be done all the time! Online gaming has become an sensation!, and not only an @NUM3, @NUM4 and @CAPS8, @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 can “game” too! So many people are gaming now, that if your not, you are missing out on an amazing experience. Some people think gaming is a waste of time, but the same can be said for any indoor leisure activity, everybody needs a fun activity they can do anytime! Besides everybody likes having fun! Some people believe the ludicrous notion that technology is making @LOCATION1 into fat, lifeless losers, but, it is opposite, you can socialize online and meet new people. People (like myself) can balance computers and games, with exercize and sports. With computers you can efficently complete work and learn new skills! Computers are posotive if used correctly. I hope you like this artice, thanks for reading.",12
1008,"I am writing this article to inform you on how most people are spending their time an computers. In this article I am going to tell you about computers and what people are doing with them these days. Some people use their computers for business of work related. But then again these are people that use them for entertainment and other social things. These are the people that just sit on the computer all day. What they could be doing is enjoying life. Going outside and getting fresh air. But no they want to sit inside all day long on the computer. Now is why do people want to stay inside all day long on the computer some people are constantly on their social websites. Such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. They are obsessed so thoes are teo websites that are very addicting to some people. and then these are the people who just like looking things up. Then lastly just get off, go spend time with your family the computer will always be there. And use the computer only when you need to. Yeah its fun to go look up things for your entertainment. But all things are good in moderation. So I hope you will listen and also agree with me I think I made my point about how much you should use computers. So thank you for listening.",6
1009,"Dear @PERSON1, The use of computers is not beneficial to our society. I fear that many kids will suffer from child hood obeasity, this is because of the inactiveness of so many teenagers my age. They @CAPS1 could be enjoying life outdoors and staying active, but they choose to sit infront of a screen all day, everyday. Researchers have proven inactiveness is at large due to many, facebook, mysape and twitter users. These websites are nothing but trouble, other than being unhealthy, teenagers all over are being cyber bullied, to the verge of suicide. Many are not aware of the several pedifiles and creepos these sights carry, which can lead to abduction, rape or worse. By staying active and being outdoors with your friends could save you from these dangers. Go outside run a little, you would be amazed how much a little exercise can help you. Also I firmly believe time should be spent with your family, doing family activities and eating dinner with your parents. By doing this you become closer as a family, and it could help you make healthier choices keep exercise. I believe by following these simple steps, staying active, staying off the computer and spending time with the family. Is much more beneficial than learning how to type, or talking to your friends. Using the computer leads to cyber bulling, and dangerous people, living healthy is the way to be.",7
1010,"Dear editor, @CAPS1 you think that people spending a lot of time on the computer is good, I don't. People should get more exercize. Also they don't get enough fresh air. Finnaly they don't spend enough time with family and friends. Now we have to determin weather people should spend a lot of time on the computers. Those people who spend alot of time on the computer could be going outside everyday to get exersize. Some parents got their kids hooked on playing on the computer all day instead of going out side to get exersize. They could ride bikes, scooters, play basket ball, wiffle ball. They can also go swimming play, sports, and go to a play ground. Finnally they could go for a long walk on the beach. People need to get fresh air instead of being on the computer all day. They can go sit on the beach for awile, go outside to watch their kids play or watch their games like baseball or basket ball, or they can go outside just to be outsides. They can go sit on their porch to wait for their kids to get off the bus from school. Those people who love to play on the computor don't spend enough time with their family or friends. They could go visit their family more often, go out for lunch with their frinds. Also they can spend more time doing things with their kids. Even though there is a chat on the computer it is nice to talk to your friends in person. The time has come to decide weather people spending a lot of time on the computer is a bad thing or not. They don't ge enough exersize every day. They also don't get enough freshair. Finally they spend time with their friends and family. So now you need to write a letter to your local newspaper telling them which you are choosing.",8
1011,"Being a teen myself, my computer is something I don't think I would be able to live without. But is it holding me back from more important things? I think so. I feel that not having computers will in a way educate people more so than now. For example with school research papers we imediatly go to the computers in order to find information when we could be using books and magazeens. With having the use of computers many people don't properly know how to use and find information in books. Also being around computers and using them so much is pulling families further apart and stopping humans from being more interactive with nature and the environment. For many people using a computer is a life style, it's something we tend to use more than religiously and that @MONTH1 not be the best thing. Children, teens and even adults get extremly addicted to computers. Teens and children use laptops and @CAPS1's everyday in order to do their school work, and to talk with friends. As well as parents/adults, they use it to get their work done and use it as a easy communication with co-workers. To this very day people have become very addicted to computers. I know for certain that in my family, my mother, nor my father, nor my brother, nor I could go through a day without using a computer. As I mentioned before computers are also pulling families further apart. There is less family time and comunication between family members these days, due to computers. Insead of spending time with the family, teens prefer spending time on the computer chatting with their friends. I bet if there was a poll was taken on how much family time has been taken away in households because of computers I almost garentee it would be quite a large amount. I know the only true family time some families have without computers is dinner and that isn't much. Lastly many humans are not as connected to nature and as involved as they used to be. Using computer keeps people inside and not exposed to nature. Though there many advertisements and pop ups on the computer that inform us about how to take care of the earth properly, we so easily ignore them and remain playing on the computer than going outside and doing something to help make the world a better, clearer place. Not only is it just taking care of our earth, but it is also the fact that not many people these days go out and get the fresh air they need as much as they really should. Most likely not all of that is due to the use of computers, but I bet a great deal of it is. Like I said before it is super hard to imagine a day without a computer, I mean how would we communicate or do our work? But there are trulthfully other ways to do them that we just aren't very used to because of the fact that we are so attatched to them. I never really noticed till now that it is possible to live without a computer, and that so many people are missing increadable things such as family and nature because we are so addicted to the computers.",11
1012,"Dear, @CAPS1 paper edattor we should stop because people arent doing anything their just staying home using the computer. Making there life worser they should make a day whith out computors and every one goes out side and gets exsesise. Wo could mapse the world better the more you. Exersise the stronger you get people livse computers because they could there frends play games thats but some time we have to go outside. Some times i like using the computer but a littile to much land that i dont get that mach exesersise and i hope i could stop from that and go out side and exersise more. We would have computers but we wont use it like for along time then spend more outside. We should only olw kids for only two or three hours a day. When there using the computer they use over like hours thats not good they should go out side thats why.",6
1013,"Do Computers benfit the society? Yes, computers benefit the society. Computers give kids so much knowledge about things they would not be able to do or go in real life. Another thing is computers give kids a positive ego or entertainment. Also computers let other kids interact with each other like facebook, or @CAPS1. There are many good details why computers are good for the society. First, when most kids dont know an answer to question they can go on google to fing the answer. Which helps in most cases. Also when on google, or any ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"" it gives kids the chance to @CAPS2 anything and most likly get arreasonable answer. Kids can @CAPS2 up facts about other countries, famous people, and even types of pets! Another benefit of having computers is most kids on the internet go to have fun or entertain themselves, which could lead to a positive ego or better self-convidence. Just because kids arent going outside to have fun, doesnt mean they cant have fun inside either. Third, parents or any gauriden always talk about there kids or would like to see them with friends. Well having thing such as facebook and @CAPS1 or @CAPS5 you can make new friend around the town or even other @CAPS6. The internet can do all of those things. Finally do computers benefits society? Yes computers do benefits society, they can give you alot of knowledge, make new friends and to just let kids be kids. As you can see computers do benefit the society.",8
1014,"People think that useing computers is a good thing, I think so to because there are alot of other people in this country that speak different languages and the computers can teach them insted of a person that just speaks our language. This for some people is their lives even alot of people use computers for their work. Kids also use the internet not for things such as, facebook, myspace, gmail, and alot of other web pages, I also use the internet but not as much anymore but I used to go on gaming pages like, @NUM1.com or even /cup/coffee but I dont go on those anymore that much because I have xbox live and that is a thing that the internet also comes in and you can talk to your friends. Some of my friends just fo on the computer and dont get any exercise at all but alot of my friends go on it but play alot of sports so there not just getting fat all the time. So people in the world basically have a computer but not everyone in @LOCATION2 of @LOCATION1, I think that our country should write a big pay check to those poor country and so they can get computers and so if they come here they can speak our language, or we ship that of computers to their countrys and so they dont buy any crappy computers. Also when your on a computer you can buy a webcam or it is already placed into your computer and you can talk to your friends or even show them that what you made or something like that. So I think that computers are the best thing that we ever invented or who ever do.",7
1015,"Dear,newspaper I think that people should have computers I think that because kids play game to help them learn like math game or read and grown ups can go on websites and watch work out videos and they could pay there bills on the computer to and they dont have it in the store of kids need to do there homework computers are good for that buy thet also have bad stuff like kids say they are doing there homework but they are on youtube myspace or facebook. or other stuff but computers have more good stuff about them they bad things so that? Why I think we should have computers.",5
1016,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 experts are concerned about today's population's computer usage. With this I agre, as many children and adults are counted and labeled as obese, or overweigt. Technology has advanced as enough to having machines do everyday tasks, proving how lazy some @CAPS3 are now-a-days. People sit at home standing at a computer screen, forgetting about spending time exercising, enjoying nature, or being out and having fun with friends and family. Having a computer clearly interferes with one's @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in real @CAPS5, not the ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" of chatting with others over internet. Having applications released that connect people over the computer devastates the reason to leave your house. Now with video, you virtually meet the other person, showing how lonely and individually separate you can of from others. While your friends are having a party. You'll be absent, as I'm sure they won't have a webcame there. Another reason why a computer is not needed is many people neglect pure nature. When surrounded by new digital age. The beauty of the outdoors become forgotten. Sure you can watch videos, and look at pictures of nature, but is that really anything compared to the crisp, clean aid against your hair or the once in a lifetime animal actions you @MONTH1 see? Plus, nature and the fact of being outside @MONTH1 inspire you to continue a diet, or begin one, seeing how healthy and perfect the outdoor can be. It also serves as a great place to exercise. As we all know, obesity is a factor in the @LOCATION1 and around the world. But now, being oevrweight is at an all time high, claiming lives and causing many into depression. in my opinion, I believe this is highly realted to computer usage. Especially with fast food playing a role. People have not realized the need to exercise more often. In conclusion, you can see how computer usage has affected us as a nation, and in a negative way. Computer using @MONTH1 be ""ok"" when used in moderation, like sweets or oily foods. it does serve as a way to pass time, for a while, but so does exercise... Which one would you think would end as a believe solution? Obviously, we must stop relying on technology to help, and begin activities ourselves again.",9
1017,"In my opinion I agree that it benefits society. The reasons that support my decision are lots of buisnesses use computers to work, fast food resturants use computers, and schools use computers. Computers are all needed just for those reasons. My first reason is buisneses use computers to work. Workers use computers for designing, filing peoples names, and to type papers, and essays. People in the designing industry don't use paper and pencil anymore, because they use designing softwares to work. Instead of filing in a cabinet people and workers use computers to put their patients, clients, and workers. Computers can hold more information and files than cabinets can. People also type papers and essays for work. For example, news reporters have to write a report and type it for their company in order to get it to publish. If workers in buesness were to need to use computers to file, type, and design clothes and games. My second reason is that fast food resrurants or even resturants use computers, instead of using cash registers. For example @ORGANIZATION2 or @ORGANIZATION1 use technology to type in peoples orders, and amount they pay. Back then they used to use cash registers, in order to get money out they need to click a button, but now the have all locked up using computers. Every resturant has at least a touch screen computer in it to use. So resturants need computers to survive the world. My third reason is schools need computers for students and teachers to write reports, file the students name and grades into it. Students in classes write reports for projects or even for class work. Teachers need computers to file the students name, grades, and information, instead of using a cabinet. Teachers also use computers to make homework pages and they need to print stuff off of word. So schools use and need computers for students and teachers use. In conclusion I agree that computers benefit society, because buisnesses need them to work, design, and file, and fast food resturants so they can take peoples orders and to use in schools for students and teachers use. So thats why it benefits the society.",8
1018,"Dear local Newspaper A lot more people uses computers daily but not everyone agrees that it benefits society. Those people who supports advsnces in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on the people and I agree on some circumstances but looking at the situation cleary I dont agree due to the fact that its better not spending to much time on the computers. First because its way better excercising, @CAPS1 enjoying nature and lastly interacting with family. @CAPS2 why I dont agree that people should be in ther computer more their doing things better in life. First, becacuse it's useful to exercise. Talking a walk around the nieghborhood of just going for a hike with people you know. Even better going to the gym its such a better way to spend your evening instead sitting infront of a computer doing nothing but to look at a screen all day and plus exercising makes you stay in perfect fit, healthy and strong for as long as you live. A computer can just kill you not in reality but sitting all day only on the computer eating when you feel like it and no exercise that is whats going to kill you and make you become so lazy to do nothing. I know nobody would want that for sure. @CAPS1, enjoy nature live life the way it needs to. Gods creations of nature is the must beautiful thing in this world dont let it go all to waist. Jump off a waterfall or go to the park let the wind hit your face. Make imaginations become real and just enjoy what natures about. Third and last, interact with your family and friends. Spend time with them and watch movies or any sports channels. Go with them for some ice cream. Dont let them feel left out or unloved. The mall is a great way to spend time with your friends or family also going to water parks like six flag or lake compound of place like nomads or chuckie cheese its a great way places to spend and interact with your family and friends it also can bring closer as well. This is why I think sitting infront of a computer screen all day, first its a waist of time when you go do some exercise or @CAPS1 enjoy nature or lastly interact with your family and friends, @CAPS2 why sitting infront of a computer as a waist of time and negative why to spend your days of living life. Technology holds you back from the real things in life. Thank you for reading my letter and hope you take it in consideration. Good day!",10
1019,"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON2 and I am here to give you @CAPS1 opinions about computers. Computers are fun and educational. They have lots of websites for games. Such as portaportal, @NUM1.com, they have safe fun games for kids under @NUM2. They also have educational websites that help you with your work. Such as google. Ask your question.com these websites have all the info on things you need help with. They also have @CAPS2, facebook. Yes I know there has been rumors about people threatening over chats. But other than that your able to chat with your friends instead of waiting for your mom to get off the phone. @CAPS2 lets you meet new people without having to tell them who you are. @CAPS1 opinion is that computers are safe in different occassions but are also very fun & educational.",6
1020,"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I am against that computers benefit society in anyway. Yes computers are a great way to learn about things all over the world, but people have to worry about what is right in front of them. Being on the computer all the time gives less time of exercising, no sight of enjoying nature, and gives less time of interacting with family and friends. Computers don't benefit everyone because it gives less time of exercising. When people don't exercise because they are busy always doing something else less important, then you would always be tired. You won't want to do anything but just sit around & do nothing which calls for laziness you would go weak without exercise. You wouldnt have the strength to eat or lift anything which calls for your bone to go weak and you wouldn't get the calories & calcium & vitamins that your body needs to be strong. You would gain weight which calls for you being out of shape. Since your body has no exercise the weight & fat just stays. Being on the computer doesn't help you enjoy nature the way that you are supposed to. You will never see the world for what it is. You will always miss out on fun activities, then when people start talking about how much fun they had you're going to wish you were there. And you will always be stuck in the house which is going to get boring & there's nothing fun to do. If you're always on the computer cell the time you will never interact with family & friends. That is mostly & always more important than computers because they are always always going to be there for you. You will miss out on fun important occasions with your family because you're so addicted to the computer. And your friends will stop being with you because you're not hanging out with them. Computers really don't benefit everyday people because you miss out on the greater things of life. You will miss out on exercising, nature and especially family and friends. Then you are going to wish that you had spent time with them instead of the computer because you are going to see they had a great time & you would want a great time too!",9
1021,"Dear Newspaper, Computers have a huge effect on society, can you even imagine where we would be without them? They are great for communication, learning, and shopping. Computers have a large effect on people. Without computers, communication with co-workers, family, and friends would be nearly impossible. Social networking sites, such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4-In play a huge wrolein everyday life. These are the sites you use to access information from others to making plans for the weekend. Do you think that your children use the intrenet too much? Nowadays, that is their way to communicate with their peer. It makes them more social, which is a great quality to have in life. Also, I don'd know about you, but I have talked to many people around the world using the internet. It gives you the chance to experince other cultures. Communication was absolutely not as easy before having computers. It @MONTH1 seem hard to believe, but you can learn tremendous amounts @MONEY1 things from the internet. This @MONTH1 include learning about people. How would you video chat with someone without @CAPS5 or @ORGANIZATION2? You can learn a lot about a person from talking to the face to face, a thing that can't be done on a phone. Also, research for school could not be done without the internet. In a recent survey, @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM2 teenagers said that they use a search engine site, such as @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS6, or @ORGANIZATION3 at least once a day, @CAPS7 out @MONEY1 those @NUM1 said that it is for school. If it weren't for these search engines, children wouldn't be doing too great in school. Clearly, the computer provides ample ways to research and learn on a daily basis. It @MONTH1 sound rediculous, but in @DATE2, @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 shopping was done on the internet. If someone wants to start a business, their first stop is usually the internet. People are making @MONEY1 every year with the help @MONEY1 computers. People find it easiest to buy something with the click @MONEY1 a mouse. It is easier than the hassle @MONEY1 crowded malls and long lines. Also, do you remember when @CAPS8 @DATE1 was the time to put the alarm clock on for @NUM4 @CAPS9? Well, how people do @CAPS10 shopping online, there are hundreds, even thousands @MONEY1 sites that offer great sales. Now think about how purchasing items would be if it weren't for the internet. It's not agreat image, is it? As you can tell, computers have affected our lives in a great way. Communication, learning, and even shopping have become much simpler. Many @MONTH1 think that computers are not bad to have, but the good over shadows those aspects.",11
1022,"Computers are a huge impact on society, but do they make everything better? People spend way to much time on the computer. Computers do not help you brain they can make you fat and for a lot of people they cause drama. People should stop spending so much time on computers. Computers do not help you brain in any means possible. Think about it, sure you do alot of you work on computers but, what about your kids they spend most of their time gand online and doing pointless stuff. Instead they could be going outside or even study. the internet is open to the world so anyone goes on it and if your child is on the computer is exposed many vile things that will not help them in the future. Its a proven fact that the less time you spend watching tv or on the computer you get better grades. I remember my mom always yelled at me for being on the computer and getting bad grades so she took the computer away for a while and now i have much better grades. So being on the computer does not make you smarter. The computer can make you gain quit a bit of weight. If your on the computer a lot you are sitting around and a lot people eat while they are on the computer. So now you are sitting around the computer eating. That can make you gain weight. I know from experience that being active and going outside or exercising really makes you feel good. Once you gain all that weight it is very hard to get rid of it. Sitting around like a couch is not healthy. You can become obese. So you could say your happy with your weight but no one ever said it was healthy. A lot of people have died frombeing that beaky. It puts a huge tall on you life. If you dont want to die from being to heavy then I advise you to get off the computer and go outside and live yor life. The last thing that makes computers so bad is the drama they cause. Mose pople have facebook, aim, or @CAPS1 but if you ask anyone with one of those they will most likley say they have gotten in a fight through one of those. Also now they have something new called formspring which can let you be anomous and people go on yours and just say horrible things. One of my friends was a victim in that and it ruins you. Also their are so many people on facebook that lie about who they are and anyone can easily find out who you are and kill you now a days people know how to hack into peoples computers and get info. So computers can not only be unhealthy but they can be deadly. Why would you want any of those things to happen, when its so easy to just back on your computer time. Remember computers dont help your brain, they can make you fat, and they cause a lot of drama. So please dont use the computer.",9
1023,"Dear @PERSON2, @CAPS1 your latest article on the goods and bads of computers in our society was informative, I believe you left out a few major reasons why technology is doing more harm than good. If people don't become aware of the consiquences, who knows where our world is heading? First off, I'd like to mention the health issues associated with technology in general, but especally computers. Dr. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION2 states that ""@CAPS2 since the popularity of the internet boomed with the invention of websites like '@CAPS3' and '@CAPS4', we've seen a drastic spike in obesity-related heart disease and diabetes."" And @PERSON3 isn't exaggerating. Because of the sudden boom in electronics, more and more people prefer sitting on the couch with their brand new laptop or @CAPS5 then go for a bikeride or play a game of fastball with friends. Because of this, more and more people become victims of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and bone elipses that could leave them paralized for the rest of their life. Is playing that online game so important, to you that its worth your life? Next, I'd like to touch on the fact that @CAPS1 the internet @MONTH1 seem like a great place to do some socializing, it can actually aid in losing friends insted of making them. I know what your thinking, @PERSON2, 'But sites like '@CAPS6' help people connect, why would they lose friends?' @CAPS7, really. Since its so easy to type in a conversation, people are losing actual social skills. They also spend too much time talking to friends without meeting face-to-face, and that eventually causes them to drift apart. And when talking to someone over a screen, its so hard to know if your actually close friends. Because of this, they cant bond and they wont have a real friendship. @PERSON4, a @NUM1 year old at @ORGANIZATION1, says that him and his best friend now only talk over @CAPS3, and they dont even feel like true friends anymore. So finally, I have a request. Next time you turn on that laptop, think. Is this really worth losing your friends and even your health @CAPS2? Next time feel the urge to update your status with something like '@CAPS8 got home,' @CAPS8 call a friend over to go hang out at the park instead. Trust me, you'll be glad you did. Thank you for the time to read my letter.",10
1024,"Dear local newspaper, I agree that people are spending more time on the computers and less time doing other important stuff. For example, they don't spend time exercising, enjoying nature, and they don't spend time with their family. Those are very important things that people don't undeRstand that they are missing of. First, people that spend a lot of time on the computer don't do exercise. Doing exercise is good for your health. If you don't do exercise when you get older your bones are going to work. Also, you could get fat and that is bad for your heart. Just for being on the computer people don't pay attention to their health. Next, people don't enjoy the beautiful nature that is outside. Is beautiful when you hear the birds singing or seeing the plants outside. People are forgeting about nature. They don't recycle so the planet could be clean. The air that we smell is not clean because they don't care about nature. Instead of being on the computer they chould help so the world could be better. Finally, people don't spend time with the people that love them. Is very important to spend time with your family. People don't realize thats the first thing in life is your family. Instead of being on the computer, is fun going to the beach with your kids, wife, father, and etc. In conclusion, i believe that computers affect on people. People just for being on the computer they don't do exercise, enjoy nature, and they don't spend time with their family. Now that you heard my , i ask you to think about yours.",8
1025,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am here to talk about my view on computers, about how they help people, and how many people say that kids and adults are spending to much time on them. My first views on this subject is that computers are becoming more and more advanced as time goes on. These past few years, computer company's have been making enormous strides allowing people to do allmost everything. This is both good and bad. A computer is a tool that is a good feature for any home. It is great for people who own a small business, you can easily go online and update somthing yoou want changed in your store, such as designing colorful posters to put on the windows of your store to increase business and to catch peoples eye. You are also able to book flights weeks or even months before you even go to the airfort. This is good for those who are busy and travel a lot. You can go on a website called @ORGANIZATION2 where you can go anywhere vin the world and zoom in on a landmark such as the great @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2, or the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 in @LOCATION1. Computers can also improve your hand eye coordination when you type. Typing is a important skill to master, if you are a good typer you can do things much more efficient then you would on paper. Some can even memorize the key board and not have to even look down. Computers are also great for communication if you have relatives far away in another state or even country you can easily talk to them through @CAPS4. @CAPS4 is a online service that you use to talk to them in person. These are just some of the things you can do with computer. On the other hand many say that people are spending to much time on computers, and getting outside for execise and not spending enough time with family. I do agree this is the case in some ways. I know some friends who average about six hours a day on computers which to me is to much, also parents become to busy with work that they are on computers, when they should be spending time with their kids. Some kids became so addicted to computers that they might become unhealthy and become obease from sitting so much, this is something that should not happen. I hope you have learned a little bit about the good and the bad about computers, and how it is important not to be on the computer to much, but it can be an important feature if used correctly.",9
1026,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 has lately come to my attention that people were saying that computers aren't important. Well, I strongly disagree with that statement. I think computers teach excellent hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and even allow you to chat online with family and friends. Computers teach a lot of hand eye coordination. Study's show that @PERCENT1 of all football players have excellent hand eye coordination. I'm sure this is because after the football players get home from a big game or something they log into @CAPS2 and make thier status all about thier win. Plus, they probably pull up pingball and see how long they can go without getting the little ball down the hole. Do you have good hand eye coordination? My second reason that I disagree with the previous statement would have to be that computers give people the ability to learn about far away places without ever leaving home I mean @CAPS1 is so much faster than having to go to the library. At the library you would have to first get there, secend pick out your book, and third check @CAPS1 out. with a computer in all that time you could be completely finished with you whole project! Finally, the reason why computers are so important is because @CAPS1 keeps people in touch. Do you have family members who live far away from you? I @CAPS3 I do. I can't always call them on the phone @CAPS4 I want to talk to them so I just log on to @CAPS2 and if there online I can have my conversation with that person. I don't @CAPS3 about you but I'm really close to my grandma. Unfortanitly she doesn't even live anywhere close to @NUM1 hours to me. She's way down @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. By car thats one and a half days and by plane thats three hours! So @CAPS1's so much easier to log on @CAPS2 and have a private conversation with her rather than driving a day and a half or flying for three hours. So in conclusion I'm sure you totally agree with me. Computers are just amazing! They help you get hand eye coordination, let you research something super quick, and let you stay in touch with far away friends and family.",9
1027,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are a vital source for anyone's household. Many people have busy lives and having a computer at home make it easer. You can use it for research, organization, and business matters. I don’t know what I would do without one. Education is very important especially in our economy today. The computer makes work and studying fast and simple. When you need to research a topc for school there is always an endless library of information @CAPS6 you turn on the computer. You @CAPS7 get your information from books, and encyclopedias but it is rare that you always have time, to get to a local library. Also, @CAPS6 you have a project in school that you need to type, it is helpful to have a computer at home so you don't have to use at short. This way, you have more time to get extra from teachers @CAPS3 on instrument in the school band. I can imagine that my grades would be @CAPS6 i did have access to the internet of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 at home. Have you over pare or document and had an of her and happens @CAPS6 you own a computer you can backup @CAPS7 you imagine on essay five pages and organized is boring, biut you wouldn't think so @CAPS6 it saved you from hours worth of writing! For some people, having a computer @CAPS7 make you money, and who wouldn't like more money? You can run a business online and avoid the hastle of manting a @CAPS8 your own space or building to run your business can be quite expensive and time-consuming. Also, you can refrain from making a trip from the store by purchasing items online. Then, the item will be shipped to your door. You save time and money on gas by doing so. And thise days, any way to save money is a good one! By having a computer you can boost your education.Keep yourself organized, and save money. Although it has many recreational purposes as well, it also can be very helpful in your life. And besides, is perfectly fine, to go online to talk to your friends once in a while, isn't it?",9
1028,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 percentage of people all over the world do you think have a computer and think that it has a positive effect on them? Well about @PERCENT1 of the world says that computers are a great way to communicate with friends, family, and different people around the world. They also mentioned now its a good hands on-eye coordination on adults and students. A wonderful educational source to use in schools, jobs, etc. First off the reason why I say that its a great way to communicate is because of the programs that computers have memoried into them that are little numbers all around universe to connect with your friends, family, and people around earth. For example like yahoo, facebook, twitter,, myspace, etc these are all types of ways to communicate with people and bring more social which is a healthy way in life. More than half the world have these communication source because one it easier and you get more of your mind. Another reason why they @MONTH1 have these connections its probably because its a better way to see one another if you live in different parts of earth. The reason why I said that its another way of seeing people around the world is because right now I'm living in @LOCATION1 and in order to see the ones I love and care about is by my myspace and facebook to be able to see my family and friends that lice that live in different locations from me like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION3, etc. Another reason is because its a good hands on eye coordination on adults and students.",7
1029,"Dear @CAPS1, you sit down at the computer with a glass water and an afterschool snack, possibly an after work snack. You log on to your many accounts, open some chat boxes with your friends & start researching for your project. As more & more people log on to technology, they seem to come out with new things for computers. Some people are missing out, & dont see the negatives, like social relationships failing, procrastinatting, lack of learning & more! Beep! one new @CAPS2 message. On the computer you can talk to your friends & family, but sometimes people are on so much that in real life relationships fail. You cant type a @ORGANIZATION1 message or hide your feelings behind a screen. Also for kids when they get older, many jobs require customer service, and if you only are good at talking to people on the computer, it cant help you. Whatever you say on the internet can be read & posted anywhere, any site, any time, whereas in real life its really you talking. School are learning are very important too, but sometimes I know I have homework but procrastinate and say ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 do it later, i need to check this out!"" putting my learning to a stop. Some people dont like school, but its very important in a persons life if you like to be successful, you need to balance school, learning, computer time, and dont forget exercise & possibly work! Computers can be helpful with research & guides, but facebook or twitter is going to slow you down. So buckle down start that research! Chatrooms, @ORGANIZATION2, email and other things can be harmful to you. There are many predators out there who are just waiting for anybody to log on. Its very dangerous, and someone can pretend to be someone there not. Also, computer all day with no exercise can lead to obesity, and sometimes your hands posture can give you carpal tunnel syndrome. There are many bad things that result from computers. Many times in your life youll need to find a balance. Dont overlook the negative or you could get hurt. Computers are nice to have, but be careful not to whittle away all of your time on it!",8
1030,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to you about how technology affects people. My argument is that some people think that Computers are taking to much of people time, I will tell you how technology keeps people from excersizeing and gaining life expieriences. Now I will explain in further details. My first reason for sayi-ng computers affect people is that they cant get excersize when there face is glued to a computer screen all day. And especially with the amount of kids palying video games or playing on the computer, the childhood obeasity rate will slowly rise due to them not getting excersize or they will just get very weak. That is why computers have a negative affect on people by not letting them get the excersize they need. My seconed reason for saying computers have a negative affect on people is that they won't be able to gain life experience I say this because when something asks you ""@CAPS3, what did you do today?"" youre only answer could be ""@CAPS4, can we chande the question to what did I not do today?"" @CAPS5 when your on the computer all day you wont be able to explore and obseve nature well maybe you could do that on a @CAPS6 server but it isnt the same. And even when parent ask if you want to go for a walk you should do it, You could learn somthing or see somthing you wouldn't be able to see on a daily basis. That is why computers have a negative affect on people when their face is glued to a computer. So now I am going to close this letter and I hope you see that excersize and gaining life experiences will change your life forever.",7
1031,"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers defenetly help our society for many reasons. For example we can talk to friends on line. Not only that but then you can learn alot more about the paces you want to visit. Its also tru that you can gain more hand eye cordanation with those nifty devises. Read on to find out how you can talk to friends on the computer. You can talk friends on the computer by one of the most comon website facebook. @NUM1 people use facebook, thats @PERCENT1! Not only that but you can also meet new friends on the computer by talking about games or popular @CAPS1.V. shows. Wouldn'@CAPS1 it be nice to meet up with all of you old friends from school that you don'@CAPS1 ever see. My mom always says that that is how she stays close to her friends and that is the same with me. Do you want to learn about the far away places without breaking the bank? If you do then you should deffinetly search for some nice websites that explain culture and other details about other parts of the world. It's also true that you can learn a quick history lesson on some webpages. What if you are going on a trip but you don'@CAPS1 know were to then you could use the beloved internet. Read on to find out how the internet helps gain hand eye cordanation. You can gain hand eye cordanation by using the computer so many ways. For example you can practice typing up essays and other work projects. @PERCENT2 of people that have compters type faster than they write. Thats almost everyone. Not only that but don'@CAPS1 you think typing is faster than writing? Also you see the words that you are typing and you press with you hands. Thank you for reading my essay on why computers are benefiting our society. Just remembe we learn more every day from the computers. Also you can talk to friend. Lastly you can plan your trip. ",8
1032,"Dear local Newspaper, I assume you've heard about the ongoing debate about computers. I personally believe that computers do benefit society. I believe this because computers benefit by its online, internet, and overall help in other things. My first reason for why you should believe that they benefit society is that computers have online. By online in chat rooms, bank, etc. this helps because people talking to other people online can beast there their morale. it can boest morale in situations like with military officers, soldiers because they don't get to see their family but online can change that in on instant. Online also helps because you can pay bills to gave bank and it overall saves a trip to the bank & a waste of gas. So, online is my for why you, the local newspaper, should agree with me. My second reason is that the internat benifits a lot. The internet, a marvelous created @NUM1 years ago . Its great because you can buy things it, like on a websites such as ebay, amazon, etc. This helps because it also saves time. The internet is great also because with the internet, you can learn of foreign nations. Finally, the internet helps because you can receive news through it. This benefits society because people can instantly hear about natural disasters & problems occuring in the community, rather than hoping to find it in the new or on television. Thats my second reason for why you should agree that computer do help. My final reason for why computers benefit what the help, overall in other situations used later rather thab just the computer. For example one way the computer can help in the future, is that a student can research info a bout a subject online and it can help raise their grade on a project. Stedy has proven that computer training in the , by playing online games with other people, like in call of duty, helps boost soldiers' accorucy. it helps because it boosts their hand-eye coorination & we all increases their accuracy in target shooting @PERCENT1. This @MONTH1 not seem like much but, on the battle field, it can make the difference between life on death. Computers not only help that but they are plentiful & can be used in places such as libraries on internet cafe. That my final reason for why you should go with computers. Some people might believe that computers are bad thing sina they take time away from exercise, but that can easily be solved by using the internet to buy an indoor joggee. Computers benefit society by using online. the internet, and overall help in future situations. There are the reasons for why I believe you should go for the cause of computers. Thank you for taking the time to read my opinion.",9
1033,"Dear @CAPS1, I feel like computers are good for you in a lot of ways. Like computers sometimes keep kids out of the street so they wont get in trouble. The computer has a lot of games you ran play on so it would keep you doing something. Computers also have something called microsoft and microsoft is something that help you do writing projects and things like that. Computers help a lot of people cause like I said earlier it has games and some of those games have to do with school such as science, math, reading, and social studies so it is very helpful. Computers are also bad for people like you because when you go on it most teens liketo go on something called myspace. Myspace is a thin that you can have freinds all around the world and can talk to them and put pics of yourself on it. If you go on myspace and have friends from different state or the same state you that they world want to find you and rape you. They would start a conversation with you like they would ask you for your name and where you live. Another reason its bad is because when @NUM1 graders go to the middle school @NUM2 grader will tell the inaproperate websites and the little kids would go on it and will get in trouble. Well you heard my opoin I hope you understand thank.",8
1034,"How much of your free time daily to you spend on the computer? It is proven that people too to fifteen years old spend an average of @NUM1 - @NUM2 hours of their free time on a computer. People age sixteen to forty-eight spend @NUM1 - @NUM4 hours of free time daily on their computer. Too much time on the computer can interfere with physical activities, social time, and health issues. Computers have some good advantages here and there but mostly result in a negative effect. In this post decade, the percentage of exercise was gone down and computer bills have gone up. Americans have now spent most of the time web surfing, playing online games, and interacting with online chat rooms. After school, kids go home and turn their computer on instead of going outside running and playing. More people across the country have gained weight due to unhealthy food and no physical exercise. Many local sports have lost teammates due to lack of desire for physical activities because of computers. Many people have stopped going out with friends and family due to going on the computer. The that runs through @CAPS1 minds these days is 'why go out to talk to my friends, when I can talk them online?' I think the opposite. Get out of the gloomy house and go out to see my friends. I don't even go online within every days. I check online for homework and in online shopping twenty minutes. Computers have a major effect on social lives like going out and being confident to meet new people. Lastly, health issues are raising rapidly! The reason we now have shows on @CAPS2 about people with weight and health problems can relate very much so back to the negative effect on people. Like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and the obese have shown how people gain weight. I think at least @PERCENT1 of these people spend to much time on the computer and not exercising. Eating @PERSON1's then goint home to play online games will definately increase health issues like weight, organs being unhealthy, muscles not functioning properly, and eye and brain damage from starring at a mouse and screen nonstop. People should stop spending so much time on the computer and get outside or get active because computer use does have a negative effect. It interferes with social time, health, and physical activities. Get up and prevent the negative effects of computers.",9
1035,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 do you feel about computers? I know that I think they are a great to we are lucky to have them. They have to be used in moderation though, because exercise and staying healthy is good. I hope you will share my opinions in your next article to help pursude readers on my view of computers. What I believe is the best thing about computers, is that it is a great source to learn. The internet can connect all over the world, and you can learn about other cultures. You can know everything about that country without ever visiting! Or you can use it to find out about you family's history. Many record keeping systems are switching to computers now. When we took a field trip to @LOCATION1 they had data bases there that had every name of the people that went through there. Studies show that @NUM1 people find the internet easy to use, and quicker than any method. Another thing about computers is they help you in the work place. Lets say you had a job designing houses to be built. In old times you would have to draw it out by hand using numerous instruments and tools, but now you could make the design using just one tool, the computer. It is a much away way to to you job and if assists the customers because before if the wanted the house to be a different you would have help to draw it all over again. Now you just have to make an ajustment on the computer and in seconds its done with the new design. These day if not @PERCENT2 then @PERCENT1 of house designers use computers. Computers also play in a social role. On the internet you can connect and chat with friends. Also you could share pictures of both of you at a baseball game @DATE1 to keep memories. Or you can send them a website with a really funny video of someone getting with a soccerball. Experts did a study and it showed that @NUM2 times the reason a teen goes on the internet is to connect with friends. ""@CAPS2 @PERSON1 (computer expert and developer) what do you think the number one reaso teen use computers teen use computers is?"" @CAPS3, I would have to say to chat with friends. I dont see why they wouldn't, it's simple and almost in ."" Computers are, a great advancement in our technology. They assist us in everyday life, life and make difficult tasks simple. They should not be over used though and you need to keep a healthy mind and body. All of the thing we could learn from them though help in the argument of that. To me the computer is the same step forward as the light bulb was. Computer source found @PERCENT3 of in @LOCATION2, and. I believe they will be in all of our homes. Some families find them @CAPS2 useful the have more than one in the household. They can come in all shapes and sized to fit your wants and needs, and can connect you to anything in the world.",11
1036,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 back a couple decades ago, before computers existed. What do you see? There were children outside exercising, playing with friends, and living somewhat danger-free lives then came the computer. Computers are driving the next generation to a dangerous life of staring at an assortment of pixers all day longels well as ruining any civilized relationships you had. I strangly believe that computers have a negative affect on society. Did you know that as tha number of computers sold increases the obesity rate has gone up @PERCENT1 since computers came into our lives why? Because people spend way too much time on and not enough time exercising! Computers another affect of the long hours spent in front of screen is a decrease in eyesight ability. My family friend, @PERSON2 had to get glasses because his eyes were damaged by the computer. ""I'm worried about my daughter's eyes...she stares at that screen for hours on end!"" @CAPS2 @PERSON3, a concerned parent at @ORGANIZATION1. How could something so harmful possibly be good for our society? Speaking of hurtful, the internet is very unsafe. Predators surf the web, looking for young, innocent people to meet and most likely abuse @PERCENT2 of parents much been monitoring their children's computer usage parents are unaware that the internet makes it easy to talk to anybody in the world, from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2! Monitoring would also come in handy when it comes to innapropriate videos, pictures, and discussions on the internet. It is so easy to be surfing the web and fall upon things you should not be seeing! Lastly, people easily get caught up in being hidden behind a computer, and say mean, hurtful things that would never be said to one's face! these unfortunate factors cause many of the issues between people today. Speaking of which, computers have a very negative affect on relationships nowadays. As I mentioned earlier, so many fights happen through computer communications. Even if online conversations are friendly, they get people accustomed to making people ""@CAPS3"" through a computer, not face to face. After being in a computer-oriented friendship, people tend to forget how to act face to face and find personal meetings awkward. @PERSON1, an eighth grader at @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, ""I can't @CAPS5 only talking through computers, never being civilized with other human beings! Unfortunately, that is where computers are leading us to..."" @CAPS5 never seeing your best friend in person , only through technology! It @MONTH1 not even be your friend. It could be a dangerous poser! This is yet another problem...through the internet, you @MONTH1 not even know who such relationships are with! It could be fake, and you'd have no idea. Spending all day rolling away in front of a computer, putting yourself and relationships in danger is, unfortunately, the effect of computers. Computers are not worth the terrible consequences civilization must face. I @CAPS6 urge you to stop the advances in technology now, before it is too late! Make the change today.",10
1037,"Did you know that computers are the number @NUM1 selling electronic device in the world? I think that computers are only making our soceity a smarter and more inteligent place. Also computers help old time friends and family keep in touch. Finnaly I think they are helping are society because computers teach great hand-eye coordination. Studies have shown that @PERCENT1 of the people growing up with computers at home have a high paying job! Computers are very intelligent pieces of equipment and if you know how to use a computer you will most likley hae a high paying carreer. Also mostly every job from doctor to police officer to casheer at a store all involve computers and to go those jobs you must know how to work a computer. This is only one of the many reasons I think computers will benifit our soceity. Secondly, I think that this price of technology benifits soceity because it keep family, friends and workers in touch. Have you ever had a time where you think back and wish you could see your old high school friends or even family living. Far away, @CAPS1 computers are one of the most popular ways to do so with all the new websites like @CAPS2, twitter or even your old email website people are keeping in touch all over the world. Another way computers help old time friends keep touch with the new video camera in the computer, family, friends and workers can actually see each other from different parts of the world. A simple message though one of these websites will make someones day and could even make yours. Finnaly I think that computers benifit our soceity because they teach hand eye coordination other life skills. How do you think people can shoot a gun so and so quickly or how do you think a baseball player can swing at such a perfect time. All these things revolve around hand-eye coordination which is best learned by computers. Also people can save lives by just a type about a hurricane, tornado anything but if they do not know how to work a computer many people can get injured or die. These are only three of the many reasons I think computers benifit our soceity. So think twice about the negative comments people say about computers.",8
1038,"Computers are helpful in everyone's life. New things can be learned from them. They can provide a way to contact others. And they make writing a lot easier. Overall, they have a good effect on the world. Technology lets everyone explore new topics. If something is typed into @ORGANIZATION1, results will pop up within seconds. Click on these, and information that is needed is displayed. The computer is also helpful for research papers. The internet allows a more elaborate final draft. Learning benefits a grade in school or in work. It is always good to be able to contact anyone who is wanted. With the computer, people are abel to @CAPS1, talk on @CAPS2, or even talk to a loved one on a webcam. On @CAPS2, pictures be added so anyone who wasn't able to be at an event can now see what is was like. Webcams hooked up to the computer let people talk face to face with someone else they might not have seen in months. These are all good examples of why computers have a positive impact on the human race. Writing out papers can be a hard, tedious task. On the computer, it is possible to type out words and not have to get out on eraser for an spelling mistakes. These are picked up by spell check. This way, no points are deducted for wrong spellings. Sometimes people @MONTH1 have sloppy handwriting. These dificulties can all be solved by a typing program on the computer. Therefore computers must have a positive effect on people. They teach new things. They allow people to contact others who are far away. They can also make grading a paper easy. This concludes that computers benefit the society we live in today.",8
1039,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people think that computers are used too much, and are helping people become over weight, and even obese. This is maybe true, but computers also teach hand eye coordination, give people the oppertunity to learn about far away places, and people can even coordinate on them! Over all I think computers effect people in a positive way, and these are some reasons why. Computers help teach hand eye coordination. I know your probably thinking “huh? How do computers do that? All your doing is staring at a screen.” But to your dismay computers do teach hand eye coordination. It does this because while playing games, people watch the screen, and click with their hands. They don’t just stare at the mouse while they play these games. By doing so, it teaches hand eye coordination. Scientist have provine that people who own a computer and use it at least @NUM1 hours a week, have better coordination that people who don’t own a computer by @PERCENT1! Just that statistic alone speaks a thousand words alone. Hand-eye coordination is a thing. It helps you play better in sports like baseball, and not only that but it helps future jobs. As you can tell, @CAPS1, without computers out hand eye coordination. People think that computers are only used for games, but in reality, they teach us @CAPS2 things about the world. Without computers people would know about nearly anything that’s going in other countries. For example, the other day, my mom was checking her email and came access the stay of a young, starving. That are story changer her anyday life because takes food for granted. Without computer my mom would have more in other countries. Because we live in the @CAPS4.S what’s going on in other countries. Are less fortanite, but computer help remind and teach us what’s going in the world everyday. One of the main advantages about computers is they allow people to communicate through them. Even my grandmother said the, without computers, I wouldn’t be as close to you as I am today. “@CAPS5 and my grandmother use the website skype.com. This websit allows you to not only talk to the other person, but to see them too! Because of site like these. I’m allowed to stay in contact, and be able to see my grandmother who lives faraway. Without computers this wouldn’t be possible. Not only do computers let you talk to people far away, but people close too. I often find myself asking friends over the computer, what the homework is, or whens the next test, etc. Computers make it easier to connect to people near and far. In conclusion, computers help in all different ways. The world would be upside down without them. They give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, teach hand eye coordination, and allow people to communicate with each other. Computers have @CAPS2 flaws, but they also have so @CAPS2 positive effects too that I think they shine over all the tiny flaws. Thank you",11
1040,"North @CAPS1 courier, I would like to give you my opinion on the usage of computers. I am a person who supports the advances in technology and believe computers have a positive effect on people, @CAPS2 ran benefit people in many ways. The three most important ways to me is that @CAPS2 helps with hand-eye coordination, gives people another source to retain knowledge from, and lastly @CAPS2 realise to another way for people communicate. Hand-eye coordination is an awesome skill to have in our society. In a country, being the @LOCATION2, that revolves around sports, hand-eye coordination really helps out. Using the computers really helps harness and train your hand-eye for sports such as baseball, basketball and many more. Using the computers for hand-eye coordination will really help the @LOCATION2 to develop some world class athletes. We also live in a country where their are so many drivers and cars on the road. We have a problem with bad drivers here in the @LOCATION2 so if they improve their coordination maybe the numbers of car accidents and fatalities involving automobile will decreas. Well how in computers help with with hand-eye coordination yoe ask? I'll tell you how, by people using fun gaming sites, like luniosity.com, which is a website with games for brain training. @CAPS2 helps with hand-eye coordination, concentration, memorization, and problem solving. They help your brain in all of these categories just by having cute and fun little game. As you can see in the @LOCATION2 we need improved hand-eye coordination and @CAPS2 could do many positive things for the country. We cam improve @CAPS2 just by computer. To retain knowledge about other cultures, places, people and miscellaneous things makes to amazing thanks to the computer we have for this information besides books. have the internet and computers you can know about what you want when you type in the subject into a search engine like google or yahoo. People can learn all of this wonderful and interesting information about things they of never known before. @CAPS2 also helps kids like to find information for reports and. There are truly you can learn on the internet. You can learn about or. Maybe the difference between an element and a compound, or even just the definition of the word sucess than is a to @LOCATION1. You can get so much knowledge from the computers/internet. Communication is another huge part of our daily lives. Most people have home phones or call phones, but for the ones who dont they need as meen of communication. On the computer you can use instant @CAPS3 or email; @CAPS4 twitter, or myspace as well. The computer gives people who don't have phones another way to communicate with others. Even if you do have a phone and someone you known is overseas. Instead of wasting money on a long distances just use one of the systems y've mentioned. The same thing goes for our military, they don't have phones to call home so they communicate via the computer. Communicating via computer is just another reason why the computer is so important. So as I conclude my letter to you, the north @CAPS1 courier, I shall restate that I do support technology because they do have positive effects on people. The positive effects that are the most major are @CAPS2 teaches hand-eye coordinating helps people with another source to gain knowledge, and lastly @CAPS2 allows another way to communicate with people. I will tell you once again computers benefits society and do have positive effects.",11
1041,"Dear editor @ORGANIZATION2 the source, @CAPS1, I have noticed that many people have been spending too much time using their computers.

Take my friend @PERSON1 for example. He sits at home on his computer all @DATE1 and plays games, goes on @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. He rarely gets any excersize and he almost never sees daylight. @PERSON1 @LOCATION1 gained @NUM1 pounds, which lead to obeisity and heart problems.

When students are working on a report, they very often use the internet to get information. Websites like @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION4 are most commonly used. This can be a big problem. Did you know that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION2 information on the internet is wrong? Thats more than half @ORGANIZATION2 it! The internet can also be a time waster. My bro, @PERSON2, had on assignment to do @DATE1. He stood up @NUM3 hours using @CAPS2 and didn't even write his essay. He recieved a zero on that grade. In closing, overusing your computer can cause health problems, put your safety at risk, and hurt your education.",11
1042,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, I personaly disagree with the experts who are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. The reason why I disagree is because it not the computers folt people don't get out and exercise. Buying a computer and getting on the computer is free will and the computer dosen't you get on it that's our choice so we can't blame the computer for people not excerising. Another important thing to remember is that computers are important is because they help you get more educated. For example there are computer class online for people that want to there degree in different fields, with just a click of a button you it can change you future and career for the rest of you life. The most important reason is because it help people learn about different cultures and ways of life. I love learning about @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2 even through they had that terriable storm. I thank you for listening to my opinon and I hope that it change's your point of living a life without computers",7
1043,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 best friend, @LOCATION2, was once a nerd with no hand-eye coordination, @CAPS2, he started to use a computer and now he has better hand-eye coordination than me. Computer not only teaches hand-eye coordination, but @CAPS3 gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people,and millons people to talk on line with other people. @CAPS1 friend wasn't the only person who learn hand-eye coordination. About @PERCENT1 of people learn hand-eyes coordination using a computer. @CAPS3 might takes some month to learn, but once a child knows @CAPS3, they will be outside for hours. Who would not want to learn hand-eye coordination? In addition, computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people. Computer engineer, @PERSON1, says, ""@NUM1 in every @NUM2 people learn about places and people threw the internet."" @CAPS3 will take a few hours, but you will be educated. Why would someone think we are spending too much time in the internet if we are being educated? Addionally, don't you have a friend who live more than @NUM3 miles away from you? If you do, @CAPS2 a computer will solve your problem of communication. @CAPS1 friend, @LOCATION1, lives @NUM4 miles away from me. We communicate using hotmail, yahoo, and facebook. The best thing of all is that is free unlike a telephone. Futhermore, computer specialist, @PERSON2, says, ""I learned hand-eye coordination using a computer. Most importantly, i was able to hand in @CAPS1 essay on time because of the information a computer provides and i was able to communicate with @CAPS1 family."" I didn't want to tell you this, but i was also a nerd with no hand-eye coordination and i learned just like @LOCATION2 learned. We aren't spending too much time, we are just being educated.",8
1044,"To the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, This day in age, computer technology rules the world. It's where we get our news, music, shopping and even enterteinment. Sounds great right? But there are some big downsides to this box of information. Such as, this gadget is taking over peoples lives and keeping them from excersizing. Now a days, people are even loosing human interaction from these marvelous toys. And finally, computers are very expensive electronics, they have much up keep which costs you money ultimately making you depressed. As you can see, although there are some great pros to computers, there are also pretty big downfalls that you havn't thought of yet. As I previously stated, computers are taking away from people excersicing. We're all becoming quite lazy. People rather stay at their computer screens playing grand theft auto or facebook stalking than going outside to play a game of soccer with your friends at the empty field down the street. @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 goes without physical domain for at least a @DATE1 and a half. @PERCENT2 of those people rather just tay at home on their computers. This is a disgrace! We cannot let this continue. We must change the way we live and get rid of this unhealthy appliance we call a computer. Of all my reason that computers are bed, this is by far the most disturbing. People are having less, and less human interactions as computers become more popular. Now you, can d everything from your computer. Soon people will be marrying them. Oh wait, that's already happened. Just yesterday, I read in the newest issue of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 that a man married a character in his computer game. There was a priest present and everything. They just recently got back from their honeymoon. This is sad! Look at what our world has become. People rather marry a computer character than actually communicate with real people. We must act quick, I don't know what will happen next. Finally, computer cost a lot of money. You pay @MONEY1 for the computer outright, but then you have all the up keep and there is lots of up keep. Computers are very troublesome. You just keep pouring money into it, which is just depressing. It will just break again soon or freeze and cause you to loose a report you've worked on all night. For example, @DATE1 my dad had to pay @MONEY2 in order to get my @DATE1 computer unbugged. He was so reluctant to even pay it and afterwards he was annoyed all week for even-paying it. It got even worse when it froze up a week later. He was freaking out. Thats all you get from computers, more and more frustration. I just don't think it's worth it.",11
1045,"Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are out! The effects of over-use on a computer can severely change a persons life! People who are spending too much time on their computer will most likely spend less time exercisizing enjoying nature, and interaction with their family member and friends. I believe that the act of computers overwhelming a person's life should be with in a serious manner. Exersizing, an essential part of anyone's life, since the development of the internet forty years ago, the average @CAPS1 or body mass inter of an average person has increased fifteen percent! This is no coinfidence, computers are causing more and more people to challenge themselves to nex that extra mile, or swim that extra lap, and instead so home and play on their computers. This not only is hurting peoples' weights, but excersize equipment store owners are having to close their shops, because less and less people are coming into work out, or excersize like they should everyday! Our children are also being affected by this addicting sensation, childhood obesity is one of the main effects on children, because when they get heard playing on these they as well stop excersizing, and play videogames . The average amount of people who went to @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 every year was around @NUM1, but since the invention of the computer that the attendance dropped to a more @NUM2 people every year. Less and less people are to enjoy a fresh @DATE1 and instead spend it indoors on their country. This is hurting people as well as the wildlife around them. The rates of squirrels to people in @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was @NUM3 in @DATE2, the year the computer has invented. But a mere ten years later, the changed so now their are squirrels! This is because now that they less people feeling less squirrels live in the @CAPS3 @CAPS3, went live in the to find food by themselves. Tour guides who worked in @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, we being fired, due to less people wanting a tour, so less tour guides are needed. Families are seeing that the more a person plays on a computer, the less time that person is going to spend talking to @LOCATION1, or @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Scientists held to have three different people spend an hour reading a book, another spend an hour on a computer, and three hours on a computer to see who could stay in a conversation with their mother the longest. The first person spent twenty minutes on the phone with their mother, the second only ten minutes, and the last, a mere five minutes. This shows that the mere time spent on a computer, the less interactions are held between son and mom, an important relationship in any one's life. Mother's worry that the next time they have a barbeque, @PERSON1 won't be in his room, playing on his computer like last time. @PERSON2 was chosen to conduct an experiment on @PERSON2 had three freinds @CAPS6, @PERSON3, and",10
1046,"Dear local newspaper, I think that using a computer can benifit people and have a negative on people. Benifits could be, gaining knowledge, and meeting new people, bad effects could be, weight gain, and having a lack of social skills to talk with friends over phone etc. First, gaining knowledge is really essential. The I think that is because when your computer crashes or breaks you would most likely know what to do to fix it. I dont think you would want to have to pay money to get anti software that probubly doesn't work. Anothe reason why I think that gaining using computer is good because what if you want become a computer enginere, all that time you've spent on the computer could really benifit you later on in life. Secondly I think that computers could help you meet new people from foreign countries and other states. Not you have to meet them in person you could just have a friendly consversation online. The thrid and last reason why sometimes computers can be bad for you is weight gain. Most are probably so much time on the computer that there not getting enough physical activities. All they do is sit down eat on unhealthy snack and play games, and videos. That's really bad for your health. I conclusion using a computer moderately is a lot better then using a lot. It could help gain knowledge, meet new people or make you gain weight and have a lack of social skills.",8
1047,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 is a lot of technology including the biggest hit, the computer. I say that computers have a more positive effect on people. Some reasons include that computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and even give you the ability to talk online with other people. Where would we be without computers? First of all, is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. People that type slower usually have poorer hand-eye coordination. Of course with faster typers, they have better hand-eye coordination. @PERCENT1 of people including teachers agree with this. Is this why @CAPS1 is typing ""lessons"" in computer classes in elementary school? The answer is most likely going to be a yes. Second of all, is that computers give people the ability to learn about far away places. Computers give you more resources than a book. Using the computer to go on multiple websites, is actually easier. Using these websites, people can have a higher education. One teacher said, ""using websites is so much easier for everyone. Using them for homework and having the students take notes is a lot less difficult."" And to that I agree entirely. Finally, computers give people the ability to talk to other people online. Using things like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, @CAPS3-mail, and video chat. All of these, and more give you the opportunity to chat with friends living far away. That way friendships are never really lost. People never want to lose relationships. Losing one can be very sad. I know this from personal experience. In conclusion, this is why I think that computers are a positive effect on people. From learning to chatting, computers are a great way to chat with friends and even do homework. Hand-eye coordination included. All of these are positive effects don't you think? I think so and this is why I believe that computers are a more positive effect than a negative effect on people.",8
1048,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you really think we should'nt have computers or @CAPS2 you think we shouldn't? Well I say we should because computers has everything you need as in info, games, school, websites where you can by clothes. Others say no for some reason why they say it's not good for you and to addictive I clearly think that it is appropriate. Having computers, it absolutely helps us learn, whatever you needed to learn a computer has it. If you wanted learn about other places besides the one you live in you could find it on the computer. I remember one time when I was looking for a word in the dictionary and they didn't have it and I looked it up on the computer and they had it I thought it was magnificent. I love computers it connect's me with my family that are in far away places there's nothing better than that because you could talk to your family all day or wherever you want. Computers have everything, any info you need get it off of the computer. It let's you stay alert on what's happening today in the world. It really does work on your hand and eye coordination. ""@CAPS3't that brilliant?"" Some say computers are not good because people are not enjoying nature. Or people start to not to want to get out of the house, you don't spend time with your family, because your so addictive to it. Some say your not exercising or nothing so you get too fat, or too skinny and your not healthy at all. But i disagree, that's why i @CAPS2 not like righting this side of the story.""@CAPS4 kidding."" @CAPS5 you have a chance because computers are the best they are definitely not the baddest but after reading this you could'nt agree with me more so it's @CAPS5 to agree or never to disagree. The big question is what will you choose! This is not a hard decision to make.",8
1049,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 recently has been brought to my attention that computers have been affecting peoples daily lives. i do agree with this because with our countries of obesity. More people need to exercise more, interact with freinds, and to just enjoy things that don't involve technology. Some people are just super glue to computers, but let's see if @CAPS3 doesn't start wearing down after this paper. Many individuals are spending too much on their computer and less time working out or exercising. People need to start spending more time on exercising and less time on their computer due to the facts that more and more states obese percents just keep rising. Yes, you @MONTH1 say I will just go on a diet ino! Diets don't always work and many people have tned them. Even a simple one hour walk with your dog is better than lazily browsing the web. And if you wanted, you could even join the local gym for @MONEY1 a month. Buttle only way this is going to happen is by you wanting to do so. Now you know how to fix your problem, get going! More people need to interact with friends instead of going on their computer. Interacting with friends or family will help themm be better with their social hucs in all. Yes, maybe your friends and family out and hungry with your friends most likely you will have more fun exercising then you have on the computers. By interacting with friends and family will help youn later in life by being more social and ready any job interview to meet you less nervous. F inally, enjoying things that don't involve technology is good to know because many people don't have as much fun out in the real world. You have to mete @CAPS3 fun. This can be schevered by asting a frend to go on a compy trip with ypu or spending a little diugh to enjoy yourself. The ourdoors and nature consists of many beautiful and awesome things; but the only way to realize this id to have fun outside or explore whats the great tourst. In conclusion, many people's lives are being manipulated by computers and destroying their daily live. but maybe due to these essy tips; excrsing more, by soul.",8
1050,"Computers. They are an amazing marvel of science that greatly benefits man-kind today. But computers can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Homework can be made easier, connecting with others is easier, and entertainment like @CAPS1 and video games are a click away. On the otherhand, Computers can be distracting, addicting, and tiring. It is important to know the pros and cons of computers. For example, the search engine, @ORGANIZATION1, is an easy to use website that can be very helpful. If there is a concept or problem that you are having trouble with, just type it into @ORGANIZATION1 and links to websites pop up that will help answer anything that you would like to know. There is also a website called @LOCATION1. This website is an all purpose dictinary, @CAPS2, encyclopedia and translator. I even have an application for it on my cellphone. But technology can also be distracting. Social networking websites, like facebook, games websites like @CAPS3, and also websites like @CAPS4 can be very tempting and distracting when you should be doing homework. Procrasination is very easy to give into. But self control is the only way to avoid this problem. Budgeting your time so that you can do both your homework, and go on the computer is also very important. One thing that I find very useful on computers is an online textbook. We are lucky enough today that most large books can be formated onto a computer. Instead of carrying a @NUM1-pound text book, you can just use a @NUM1 megabyte book on the internet. This makes travel to and from school much easier. That, and textbooks often use up a lot of desk space, but all you nneed is the space that a computer will consume anyway. Studying is also made easier this way. All of the things that a computer can do are great. But this can also keep us from going outside, excersising, and seing real people in real life. This need for the computer can be bad. We are too connected as a society. Our status, feelings, friends, and position in life are always needing to be updated. Distractions are everywhere. Facebook, for instance, is very addicting. You are looking at a virtual landsacape. Self control really is the only way to get off the computer and step into the real world. Overall, computers are great, but you have to know when, and how long to use it. It has several benefits such as entertainment, communication, and information. But all of these things can be just as distracting as they can be helpful. Knowing this. I hope that society can think of the pros and cons of the computer.",10
1051,"More and more people are using computers on a daily basis, but I do not agree that this benefits our society. People are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with family and friends. As people use computers more they are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Profesor @PERSON1 has done a study showing that people who are on the computer for more than @NUM1 hrs a day are overweight and do not excersise regularly. He goes on the state that if these habits continue throughout their lives they will become obeast and are more likely to die from a heart attack before age @NUM2. I have experienced changes in my communities health due to computers as well, last year I had a friend who weighed @NUM3 lbs and exercised regularly but when he got a computer that folowing year he stopped exercising and gamed over @NUM4 lbs he now is much slower and can not do more than push ups. I do not agree that computers are benefiting our society because as people use computers more they exercise less causing them to be unhealthy. Not only do computers less on unhealthy life style, it also causes spend less time with family and friends. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of children that their our computer spend less time with their family and more time on the computer. This @MONTH1 not seem like a thing at but this study also shows that @PERCENT2 children who spend less time with their familieis grow up to become lonely and kill themselves due to depresion. I remember when a new came to our school from he wasn't that kid and didn't many friends he was still doing just fun but when he came back the next year started and I found out he had at the end of he school and keep in touch with an of his friend and to his parents. So far that week of from the rest of the students and don't much. Then the we got back the @DATE1 he wasn't at school and for the rest of the week he didn't show up either and finaly on @DATE2 and teachers told us he ran away from and has still not been found. So people that use computers are spending less time with their family and friends which can cause them to become depressed and lonely. More and more people are using computers daily basis, but I do not agree that this is benefiting our society. People are spending to much in their computers and are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with their family and friends. I know that the more people using computers is not better for our society it is worse.",9
1052,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a very positive effect on people. @CAPS13 reasons are that they can educate @CAPS1, they make things easy, they are enjoyable. Below, I will explain each reason. Firstly, its very educational. Computer are like a giant resource of information. Many teachers @MONTH1 direct their students online @CAPS2 learning purposes. Also, alot of people go online to research information @CAPS2 their school, job, or a project. Great websites that are packed with information, like @ORGANIZATION1, can only be accessed using a computer. @CAPS2 example imagine having to do your research using only books, but you live far @CAPS6 a library. The internet makes that research very easy, as you access to @CAPS7 any time! Secondly, they make things very easy to do. Computer provide people with many easy, convieniant ways to do many tasks. If there werent any computers in the world. don't you think that interacting with people around the world would be challenging? Almost all of the @CAPS4/@CAPS5 in the @LOCATION2 like @PERSON1's, @ORGANIZATION2, or @PERSON2's have an online website to aid shoppers & they even allow them In buy things online, which is way more easy than going by car. I remember a time when I wanted to by something @CAPS6 a store all the way in @LOCATION1 I went online at home and bought @CAPS7 there! Also, @CAPS7 makes things like ordering @CAPS8, getting plane tickets, getting help alot much easier & @CAPS7 saves time! Thirdly, computers are very enjoyable! They provide alot of @CAPS17 things to do! @CAPS2 example if you are bored you can get on computer, & search @CAPS2 a game you enjoy. There is always a game you'll like. On of all of that, you enjoy @CAPS7 by talking to your friends and Family. You stay in touch, while enjoying their company. Another good thing that people enjoy about these computers is because they can send things to one another, lightining @CAPS10 because of email. Imagine that you don't have a phone, and you wanted to tell your husband that is away on a business trip, that you son is very sic. If you send @CAPS7 by mail, @CAPS7 take at least @NUM1 days. By email, only a couple minutes so, you can see that computer also can provide some @CAPS11 of safety @CAPS2 everybody! So, as you can see computers have a very positive effect on people @CAPS13 ways that they do this is that they are educational & they help @CAPS1 learn. They make things like ordering @CAPS8, getting tickets, or contacting helpl very easy @CAPS15, they are very enjoyable, @CAPS6 playing @CAPS17 games, to staying in touch with your Friends and Family. Don't you think that without computers we'd probably suffer? I think computers have a great effect on people",9
1053,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a humongous positive effect on people. I support advances in technology. It's @DATE1; we shouldn't be finsing information in books or writing everything by hand anymore. Life has gotten easier for everyone. Everyone can use the computer for communication with friends or family. We are able to learn things quicker by using computers. Working citizens use computers to help them with important jobs! Everything is done on computers! Computers serve as a great source of communication. Having a @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 account allows you to chat with people all over the world. It's much easier to talk to someone online for long periods of time because you won't have to pay for phane minutes! Even @CAPS4 chats are avaibale for computer users. Having a @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS5 allows you to do a video chat with someone. It makes you feel like thay are actually there in the room with you. If you have a close friend who moved across the country, then these ways to communicate would be very helpful to you! You cant have these accounts without a computer; therefore, we need computers! Computers have made our generation very intelligent. We can easily look up facts about anything on the computer. Now, if there's something we're curious about, we can just look it up on google. In the past, we wouldn't feel like looking in a book so we waid forget about it. Kids could get help with homework online if they are too shy to ask another person. At this point in time, we could even take online college courses! Being able to go to college at home can really come in handy in some people. Computers help us with our education. Adults who go to work everyday really need to use computers! people working in the medicine field, use computers to keep track of all their patients. Now @CAPS6 use computers to organize lesson plans and print out reminders for their students. Scientists use computers to do research on things for their ecperiments. Engineers use programs on the computers to help design what they are going to build. Computers wvwn allow you ti advertise your small business or company to the whole entire world. Computers have a really positive effect on jobs in our society, which is a good thing for our economy! Computers benifit us physically, mentally, and socially. Certain computer games can improve our hand eye cordination. We can learn about many things from computers! They really make us more intelligent! Computers give us a way to communicate with long distance friends and family. Websites like @CAPS7-@CAPS8 even give adulsts a chance to find their soulmate online! The positive effects of computers on people are infinite, but we need to learn not to take them for granted.",9
1054,"Dear reader, @CAPS1, people have been debating whether or not computers are actually benefiting society, especially now that the majority of @CAPS2 now own one of these helpful machines. Computers help people with everyday tasks and are no doubt doing more good than harm. Imagine how impossible it would be for most people to do their jobs without them life would become much harder for the people living on this planet. Think of the successful schools in our country, and then think of which of those schools don't have computers. Computers are the easiest way to look up information, something important when children are learning. Whenever someone needs to know something, they just google it. This comes in handy when researching for that huge project due next week. People have never been so knowledgable. Computers are only important for school, but also in the work place. They serve almost the same environments. Now that computers are so common, people can conveniently type up a paper and submit it to their boss or teacher. It saves time and effort with a more professional result. Computers also serve the important purpose of communication using email or instant messaging, one could communicate with someone on the other side of the world without that enormous phonebill.Some @MONTH1 see this as dangerous because you could be chatting with a complete stranger. However, it is also opening your eyes to new cultures. Now it's possible to learn about life in @LOCATION1 first hand. If computers were no more, it would be extremely hard for a regular person to interact with someone from another country. It's almost like isolation from the world. There are many out there who take great interest in learning other languages. Better ways exist than sitting in a classroom listening to someone talk. As a person on this planet, do you really want to be kept separate from others just because they don't live close enough? A main concern about computers is that no one will want to read books and anything else. However, a recent study shows that after computers came out, more people have begun to read. This proves that just because there is now something fun and new, it doesn't mean everything else is trash. People will still continue to do things they always did, just with something new on their list. In addition, it is the option of everyone w/ other or not they want to spent their time on the computer. If someone doesn't like the idea, they've no right to take it away from someone else computers were created to help the human race not control it. If a person doesn't want one, they don't have to get one, everything is up to them, and that is the way it should remain. The next time you see a computer, don't think of it as some sort of obsession that's keeping people from doing other thinkgs they could be. But as a universal device that allows them to broaden their horizons and learn things they probably wouldn't go to the library to look for comuputers aren't holding anyone back, but pushing everyone forward, whether at work, school, or even the house, they benefit everyone, everywhere.",11
1055,I think having computers are good because you can use it to find places. Another reasons why its good is that you can talk to your friends from the computer. You can play all types of different games and get pictures and its is good to do your homework. That is why computers are good and we need them. First reason that we need computers is that it can be a map for us. Also we could look at places we never saw before and if you want to get some where you can go the computer to do that.,4
1056,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have both good and bad effects on people. Some people just sit around all day playing games and being lazy. Other people actually use their computers for things that they need. Also some people need their computers for their jobs. I do agree that some people who spend all day in front of their computers are spending less time exercising! Would you rather play games all day instead of spending some quality time with your family and friends? Not me, I would much rather be with friends outside or having a family picnic at a park or lake. For other people though, the story is much different. Some people need computers and other advances in technology for their everyday life. A lot of jobs today require you to use a computer, for example working at a bank you use computers all day! I also think students rely on computers to do work too. A lot of students type up reports and other things for school on their computers. Students also use computers to look up information. The internet can be a very good source for students. I know for me, the internet has come in handy for school projects, or maybe something as simple as just looking up a word. I can also see why people dont really care about advaces in technology or computers! Some people dont need them for anything, and some are probably thinking people are on them way too much. To me, I honestly find computers useful because I can talk online to my family in @LOCATION1. I hope you liked my opinion about computers, remember, they are useful to some people, but not all.",8
1057,"Computers. One of the much enjoyed pieces of technology. But it is also one of the many distractions. Many people ponder if computers are really beneficial. I am one of those thinkers. I think that computers don't always benefit society. They have many, many distractions such as facebook, online games, and even inappropriate images and videos. If you really think of it, are computers as beneficial as we think? My friend, @PERSON2 was just told about facebook, and got a membership. It just started out as a 'na big deal' kind of thing. She went online often, just to check on her status and if she had any messages in her inbox, and that's @CAPS2. But then, she was full-blown addicted. She applied for @CAPS2 the clubs and groups, and she started getting behind in school. She was obtaining a plethora of @CAPS1's on most of her tests after not studying because she was on for almost six hours everyday. @PERSON2 would come home and not even bother to do homework, but would just immediately go online. After one month of being a member, she was failing @CAPS2 of her classes, and her mom took her computer priveleges away. See, she was distracted by one, little thing, and her whole life was almost destroyed. ""But, mom, i'm in the middle of a game! And I'm winning!"" @PERSON1 says vistoriously. @PERSON1 loves online games, and he wins almost @PERCENT1 of the time. But, that's not the point. He plays games @CAPS2 the TIME. @PERSON1's game playing gets in the way with the interaction of him and his family. He @CAPS3't played eith his four year old sister, @PERSON3 since she was two years old. his mother also often eats dinner alone. Sometimes, he even views inappropriate pictures when his mom is out shopping. When he's playing a game, a girl @CAPS4 him, ""@CAPS5 at my pic. They're hot! and he looks at them. He thinks they're harmless but that's not what his mother thinks. his gaming has gotten in the way of his family and social life. most people think that computers are beneficial because you can find cool information. But, you can get @CAPS2 kinds of information from books. Instead of typing '@ORGANIZATION1', you could just @CAPS5 for it in a library. It takes less time, and you won't get carpal tunnel as easily. See? Computers aren't as beneficial as most think. There are @CAPS2 kinds of distraction, and these are only a few.",10
1058,"Dear local news, @CAPS2 more and more people use computers people ask if computers actually benifit society. In my opinion I think computers do. They provide entertainment, acess to daily uses, and have many websites for social interactions. I think computers really do benefit society here in why. Computers provide entertainment to people. Many people will want to watch funny videos or thier favorite @CAPS1 show on the internet. of the most popular website for watching videos on you tube. Another great source of entertainment are video games. People buy video games at their or play them on websites like @CAPS2 you can see entertainment on the computer has a much more compared to the @CAPS1 were @CAPS2 program is shown at a certain time instead of when ever you want. Another benefit computers bring to society is acess to dailt uses, the internet provids that can tell you your local weather. Instead or local news imidiatly acess it on you @CAPS4 you can acess encyclopedia and distionarys like at the websites @CAPS5 provide an easy imidiats fools for daily uses. One least example towards the of computers Their are many websites that you can. One of @CAPS5 websites is called , @CAPS6 lets you upload picture of pople or family events for people in you @MONTH1 video chat with people over a and see the other persons face. You can't do that on a telephone or with texting or a cell phone. Many experts believe that computers are taking away time with family and friends but with websites like @CAPS6 it is actually adding time. In conclution, @CAPS5 reasons support my opinion that computers benefit society, They provide entertainment, easy acess to and have many websites for social interactions, @CAPS7 society would be alot harder and this is why I think computers benifit society.

1059,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to @CAPS2 attention that we are debating on weather or not computers benefit society. Well if you ask me, I think @CAPS1 does. For one computers help with entertainment. Second of all, they're very information. Lastly, computers make life less stressful. In the following paragraphs I will explain on @CAPS2 reasoning. Firstly, computers give entertainment. Now I can see why people say we should go out side more and excersize but, what are supposed to do on a rainy day? Well, you could go on the computer! Plus, computers give children enjoyment and make them happy, instead of being sometimes. Another reason why computers are good, is they can give children modivation. Say you're child really wants to play a new game on his favorite website, but his homework isnt done you could tell him if he gets his homework done he can play on the computer. Also, you could give him a time limit on @CAPS1 too. Lastly, for a teenager or older they are more social than little children. They go on things like ; twitter, facebook and myspace. Computers is probably their @NUM1 or @NUM2 way they communicate. Unfortuneatley. Some people abuse these rights and people get in trouble. But the good thing is you can customize you page so that won't happen. Any way children become more social. Secondly, computers are informational. They can tell you a lot by just the touch of keypad and the click of a mouse. You can search someone or something across the whole world. If you want to know the mother and how to prepare for @CAPS1, just look @CAPS1 up and do what you have to. Also, if you find out something new tell people, you can spread the knowledge. Thirdly, computers make things less stressfull. which would you rather do, type or @NUM3 pages? Well I'd type! computers make things more organized so @CAPS1's easier to find things. @CAPS1 also makes @CAPS1 easier to find things, like files because you can just do to ""@CAPS2 documents"" and find @CAPS1. As you can set computers are an important part our lives. Can you imagine a world without computers? I sure couldn't! So far i've said computers are entertaining, informational and make things less stressful. I hope you take @CAPS2 letter into concideration.",8
1060,"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on people. They are good because you can learn things educational. You can hear the latest stories on everything, and you can keep your information down for yourself. Computers are a good thing to have because you can learn information. @CAPS1 you have a question or don't know what something means, you can find out on the internet. These are some internet sources that are @NUM1 to answer questions. @CAPS1 we didnt have computers, then @CAPS1 you have a question, then you would have to go find a book to read in and that takes much more work. Another reason why computers are a good things is because you can catch up on all of the recent stories. You can learn about whats happenings in other parts of the world, you can learn things about celebrities, and you can look at the weather. You can find all this cut on television, but you never knows when it would come on. With computers, you can search all the latest stories and find things cut when you want to know them. With Computers, you can also keep information down. You could use @ORGANIZATION1 and keep everything you need to know in a nice and fashion. You can also make graphs on the computer. This way your graphs will nice have alright time and @CAPS1 you would to go information that in a @CAPS1 there were no computers then your information would not be as and you can it. I believe that computers are a good thing to have because you can hear about the latest stories, and you can keep your own information neat. I believe computers positive effect in people.",8
1061,"Dear I think computers greatly benefit society, and advance technology. They provide knowledge in a click, and entertainment after a long day out work or school. Not only that, but people have found long-lasting careers because of the invention of the computer. So obviously, computers are a great influence on society. Do you want to find out when major legue baseball first came to be? Or maybe you have a history report due the next day, and your parents can'@CAPS3 drive you to the library? This isn'@CAPS3 a problem anymore. Computers have evolved a long way since they were invented in the @NUM1's. You can check up on your local news, by having @NUM2's of electronic newspapers right at your fingertips. Or maybe you want to venture outside your neighborhood, and check out what's happening in @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1. News isn'@CAPS3 the only thing the internet is useful for though. You can also go onto one of the @DATE1's of websites for school help, or check how the stock market is doing. Or, you can just use the handy calculator found right on your desktop. What could be better? Of course not all users have a computer for information. Many have it for entertainment purposes. In fact @PERCENT1 of people use the computer for entertainment everyday. What, with all the fun stuff you can do, who can blame them? Social networking is placed at the top of the list. A whopping @PERCENT2 of internet users use sites like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. These sites are useful for catching up with friends you might not have seen in years or continue a conversation from @NUM3 minutes ago. You can also use computers to watch live-streaming @CAPS3.V, or that new @CAPS4 you got yesterday. That's right, @CAPS3.V's might not be needed soon! And what would a compter be without games? There are @NUM2's of @DATE1's of them scattered all across the web. How great is that? And finally, many people have found their careers through the internet. Did you know that @PERSON1, @NUM5, was found through you tube when his mom posted videos for the family to see when they couldn'@CAPS3 attend proformances? Of couse, you tube isn'@CAPS3 the only way to make money. Tons of jobs are listed by employers only for the curious person to find. No more wondering city streets, now you can just submit on aplication or have an interview without ever leaving your. Artists have also discovered talents, by playing around with @CAPS6 or @CAPS7. Not to mention the career paths involving computers directly, such as repairing or movie special effects. So no matter what you use a computer for have it be job hunting, entertainment, or information, they are a good idea to have them in your home. There's a erason that @PERCENT3 of @CAPS8 use them, and it's not just an excuse to sit around all stay.",11
1062,"Dear @CAPS1, People like computers, @CAPS2 a known fact. They are very much like a dry, addicting and irrestable. Despite what people believe though computers are very good for our daily lives. You can communicate play @ORGANIZATION1, listen to music watch movies, even learn a language on the computers. So in all ways, the computer is anything but bad. @ORGANIZATION1 are fun. They help us relax. In todays age, @ORGANIZATION1 just don't give people the joy they experienced when younger. Computer @ORGANIZATION1, they are the replacement. Imagine playing baseball with a friend who lives miles away from you, while still being a kid in @LOCATION1, or set in your exercise adventure. Computer @ORGANIZATION1 broke the border giving you a higher level or ""You got mail"". Many people hear that sentence more than once everyday. By many, I mean millions. @CAPS2 a alert saying that someone sent you a email. @CAPS4 are messages. Sent over the @CAPS7, faster than any service. Instead of waiting @NUM1 days for a letter, In a matter of minutes you can have a message sent to your friends. Microsoft @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and other electronic messaging systems are a superior form of communication, these let us speak to the world! Although it sounds silly, @CAPS5 you wanted by you could send a message to anyone with a message box. Lets say you went to watch a certain movie, but you don't own it. With a computer with a dose drive, you can watch any @CAPS6. Better yet, you can download the movies media are available @CAPS7, with you able to watch them with the click of the mouse. Computers are filled to the top with gadgets & accesories that make our life easier. @ORGANIZATION1, movies, @CAPS4 anything you is not likely on a computer. They are the perfect tolls in modern society.",8
1063,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you @MONTH1 know becoming reaching not only are computers are very helpful machines. Computers supply people with online education, hand eye and creativity, and computers are one of the main To begin, computers supplied large amount of people with On the computer you can anything In fact my cousin @PERSON2, earned his degree in accounting through college @PERSON2 now has a well having job in accounting. Without the computer people would not be where they are in life right now. Not to menchion just @DATE1 I was assigned to complete a history paper on @LOCATION2. All I had to do was do around an hours amount of research on @LOCATION2's coulture and history. I recieved on a on my paper.

So @LOCATION1 @CAPS6 editors, writers, and readers. Computers are helpful machines, more the mist are missing out on using a computer.",8
1064,"Dear local news paper, I agree that technology has a positive effect on people. Just like other electronic devices, computers can help you with hand eye coordination. Plus, some people like teachers, want to get staff off the internate for their students to learn about people and places. Others just want to talk to other family or friend member in other towns, states, countries, or continents. Once you read this letter, then you will understand my reasoning. Firstly, these technology enhanced dictionaries help you with hand-eye coordination. Before the computer, people had lose success in writing quickly. They had to make short notes or short handed notation like w/ or. Nowadays people write quicker and can write full words and sentences. They never understood what they wrote they put it in full sentences. When you play computer games, it gives you even more hand-eye coordination, That was only the first three reasons. Secondly, teachers use computers to get alot of school work and get information about history and geography. like an online school book, it can get information on just about anything. It can look up when @PERSON1 was born. When the dinosaurs went extinct. Fun what the government is doing now. A computer can store what you learn too. It also has search engines that help you locate the information like @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2. Statistics show that more than @PERCENT1 of people on earth use search engine to find something on the computer. On search engines they have websites, pictures, movies, maps and more. That is why people use computer for research. Have you ever fell like you don't want to travel across the @LOCATION2 just to see your relative. Well I have a solution to your problem. Computers have all sorts of stuff to can fanicate to other people. The computer mostly uses e-mail. E-mail is like a letter, but put electronically. It also has @CAPS1. It is also like a letter. If you buy a special camera that connects to your computer you can talk to them personaly. You don't even have to travel to see your relatives in @LOCATION1. That is the last reason why computers have positive effects on people. Most people use computers effectively. They get hand eye coordination. Also, the learn important facts about places and people. Plus they can talk to other people. See what I mean, computers are some and also a positive part of society.",10
1065,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people haved used a computer to learn new things such as cultures. Computers effect people in so @CAPS3 positive ways. They changed the way people think and how they look at the world. Experts even say how computers change the way they act at home and in the public. @CAPS6 also helps speical learn how to read and spell. A lot of people have used computers to learn different cultures. Which has helped are society in @CAPS3 ways. By edcuting youth so they don't make mistakes such as racial ways. Computers helped people learn things besides racial ways in the past but also about there own culture. Which has been proven by @ORGANIZATION1 news. People state that computers have made citizens lose there daily exercis. But people don't only use the computer to study they also use @CAPS6 to find different @CAPS4 different diets and ways to strech there body so they won't hurt themselfs, less than @PERCENT1 studied that the computer diets and different if themselfs to in The @CAPS5 times has said, ""The computer not only help our fitness, but also help stay in know our @CAPS6 keeps our world by one little click. And @CAPS6 gets there in less then a minute. So as you can see computers haved changed not on society but also the world. Thats how big of an impact @CAPS6 has had.",8
1066,"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I think computers have bad effects on the people in this world. Yea they have their plus' and negatives hut computers are some what dangerous. Some people who use computers use them for the wrong reasons. Some people search porn sites, and hack into servers. I believe computers are supposed to be used for positive things not negative things. Another reason why I'm against computers is the people online are dangerous. A lot of people think they're talking to one person but it's really not that person. It could be anyone. Nowadays, people just give out information to random people. This is how kidnappings and murder happens in our world. @CAPS3-@CAPS2 is also a major problem with computers. (@CAPS3-@CAPS2) - means @CAPS2 someone over the computer. The effect of that is someone getting hurt on a crime not being solved. People also spend way too much time using computers. Instead of getting outside and enjoying nature, they waste time on computers. This is also the cause of a lot of obesity. People become obese due to not gettiing out and excercising. This world uses computers for the wrong reasons. This needs to change.",7
1067,"There are some effects computers have on people that I agree with and disagree with. There are many people in the world that use computers every day and some that use it sometimes. Also it always gives you information everytime you use it. I would think that computers give a positive effect on people. Computers can have their likes and dislikes. Not everytime when you need information the computer won't give it to you. There are some websites that give you the right stuff you want to know and others do not fill your mind with positive things. That is one thing I do not like about computers. Do not think that is too bad because computers have alot more fun adavantages. One of the most common and used thing around the world is instant @CAPS7. Instant @CAPS7 is when you are communicating with another human bean over the online web. Many people use this to get in touch with a close family members or a friend. There are some names for instant @CAPS7 @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4-mail, and many more! Yes, the computer can be very addicting but once in a while you need to get off and maybe get some fresh air. For some people I agree that they stay on the computer to much and became very lazy. This is one disadvantage that can cause you from exercizing and seeing friends and family. There is no problem if you go on for an hour a day maybe more, but to long is not good. There are so many things for the computer I can't name them all @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS7, and even buying things off the computers, those are many of the things you can do on your computer. I love going on the computer time to time doing many things I have talked about. Also if you do have one than reading this @MONTH1 persuade you into getting one. My opinion is that they give you a very positive effect.",8
1068,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I think that the effect is good because every place needs them they store thing neatly that way you will know that when you go back it will be neat and saved. Every place uses computers they are a big thing. Hotels use them to save who's in each room and to actuvate the room keys, restarunts use them to help make the bill, hospilas use them to store flies so they can be printed heat so the doctor can go to look at them and understand. And schools use them they need them to store grades neatly, or for an student to to type up a paper neatly and hand it in they could leave it for the day and go back to it tomorrow. The computer can also be you job, like you workinh on them like fixing them or installing a @ORGANIZATION1 programor app. You can also do your work on it like working on a website or once agin just writing a boper. The biggest company @MONTH1 need an computer even the @ORGANIZATION1 need them they are big in you company. So even people don't get outside enought the computer help you to make money or be sucsseful in life and once yo got that money thek you will go out side in speed it. So computers have a big effect on schools, communy, stores and many other pplaeces and peoples life.",8
1069,"Dear newspaper I hear the more and more people use computers and I think thats so awesome because people talk online with other people. @CAPS5 they teach you how to use a computer. It gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Computers it the more advanced technology so its @CAPS1 the people is using it. I love to be in the computer all day because I always enter to @CAPS2 and talk online. @CAPS4 example some people like to talk with a family member the is not in the @LOCATION1 so they communicate from the computer. Sometimes I talk online with my cousin in @LOCATION2 because I have @NUM1 years I dont see her. So I think talk online or using the computer is important. @CAPS4 example even grandma have @CAPS3 and she talks online with her family members. I think the using the computer is not a bad benefit because it helps you be in communication with your family or friends. That is why I think the people is wrong saying the or is not. Secondly, it teach you hand-eye coordination my grandma is old but computer and @CAPS4 example my grandma a nice hand eye coordination because when she goes to the letters she just ress and all she is correct. think computers have a effect on people. It @CAPS5 helps people write better and better. @CAPS4 example I love and when it write I dont need to go to other I write king of @CAPS5 the helps me with my eye and hand @CAPS6 is the it helps you find faraway places and people. @CAPS4 example on @ORGANIZATION1 you find what ever street you want. It @CAPS5 help you find in the computer about people. @CAPS4 example if I have a project I find the information on @ORGANIZATION1 about people or places. The computer is really helpful because you could find pictures of places and information of people. I think is a positive effect on people. Finally, I think the computers are great benefits society. One reason is the you could talk online with people. @CAPS5 it teach you hand-eye and the helps your brain and sight. It @CAPS5 helps you at your hand movements. @CAPS6 reason is the give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. @CAPS4 example I have a project in @CAPS7 and I have to learn and search about forensic doctor and I search everything on the computer. I think the computers help your brain think more and computers are advanced technology. So I think their benefits our society.",8
1070,"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I believe that there can be both good and bad effects. Computers make things easier for people, but they are also too dependent on. Man-kind should use books for research also not just computers. Computers are very helpful for people. For example, if you really wanted to see a certain movie but you don't want to stand in line, people can go to movie tickets.com and purchase their tickets. Then, once you get to the movie theater, all that's left to do is walk over to the kiosk and redeem your tickets. Another example is that computers allow people to pay their taxes. There is special software that is able to be downloaded onto your computer. Once the software has been installed, it will usually lead you, step by step, through the process of paying your bills. It's much faster and much easier than paying ""manually"". These are some really good effects that computers have on people. Computers also have their flaws. Over time, computers have caused most people to be lazy. Some people have become too dependant on their computers. Business owners, or businessmen and women in general, are @CAPS2 on their laplops or blackberries. Everywhere you look there is another adult on the internet or e-mail. Not only adult's do this though. Students are becoming more dependant on the internet. For every assignment practically, students use google or bing. Sometimes they use or wikipedia. Students should just take the time to use their extbooks. The student body would rather watch @CAPS3, play video games, or text than do homework. This is understandds because homework can be boring but it all pays off in the end. Taking the extra @NUM1 minutes to use a textbook won't kill anyone. No one has died yet from using a book instead of google. Also, in using a textbook, you will understand how to do whatever you're doing. That isn't so bad, is it? Computers, as you can see, have both good and bad effects. It's easy to use the internet for homework but that doesn't really help you. Making purchases is fun though. It saves gas money and time. I hope you and the readers of this paper see my point of view.",9
1071,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are an amazing piece of technology, but some people are beginning to abuse the @CAPS2. There are many benefits to having a computer. In my opinion I think that computers help people out a lot such as looking up directions or even chatting with some old friends. But many People are abusing the @CAPS2 and not @CAPS1 when to get off. The @CAPS2 is a very fun thing to be on but when your on it for too long, you miss out on family acvivitys, hanging out with friends etc. I think that there should be a time limit for everyone on the computer. If we had something that would shut off othe computer but save everything you were doing, People would go out more and be more active. Eventhough people @MONTH1 be learning about things on the computer, you have to know when to get off. Now on the @CAPS2 there are websites where you can watch exercize videos or if you even want to buy some exercize equiptment etc. The @CAPS2 can be a pretty handy thing but you dont want to be on it for long periods of time. I believe that having a computer can be a very cool thing to have and very useful when you need it. But there should be time limits for how long people stay on the computer.",8
1072,"Dear local newspaper, I think more people shouldn't spent time on their computer. The reasons why I think this is because people should spend time with their family and friends, second they need to exercis more, and last go outside enjoy nature. My first reason is that people that have computers stay in their rooms all day and don't get fresh air. They need to go out and enjoy nature. People who love animals and like to study animals should go out and get fresh air watch the animals study them. Haveing a computer is you could study animals like that is ok but you dont want to got stuck on the computers. go outside and watch them instead of looking at the computer screen. My second reason is that people do get more exercis. People are getting fat because they are sitting at the computer and not doing any movement. Peple are becoming lazy every day because they are on the computers @NUM1. Is you like to be on the computer and study go for a walk, run, joy, or ride a bike to the get some so a while. My last reason is that more people need to interact with their friends and family. People should get off the computer and make some plans with their family.Have a get together with your family and go places and chill. People who be on the computers don't spend time with there family dont know whats going on around them. Some people go into depresion because they are on the computers not enough time with family. These ar my reason why i think that we shouldn't be on the computers. We should spend more time with friends family or go outside, and enjoy nature.",8
1073,"Man has always been interested in technology. Computers are just one part. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand eye coordination, saves trees, and allows people to learn about everything. Hand-eye coordination is a key part in our every day lives. Driving a car or writting all invile hand-eye coordination. I remember a few years ago I didn't have a great hand-eye coordination I had trouble catching a ball. Now days I spend up to on hour and a half on the computers. I have noticed my hand get neater and I can catch a balls with ease now. Do you want to be the one to crash your car because you have bad hand-eye coordination? Computers not only increase your hand-eye coordination they save trees too. Using a computer dosn't need any paper. You can read and write with out using a single sheet of paper. Since the computer @PERCENT1 of tree cutting has stopped. Saving trees help us stay alive. Trees put out the oxegyn that we breath in. Some say that computers are causing people to spend less time enjoying nature. I think that if it wasn't for computers we wouldn't have much nature to enjoy anyway. Lastly computer help people all around the world learn about almost anything. I scince kid, the head scientist says that ""with the computer we are able to toll the world of our discoveries much."" @CAPS1. @PERSON1 say ""@CAPS2 many people are laying had their die to the computer, they learn @CAPS2 many nutrition facts from the health sites"". Thanks to the computer we found a doctor to help my dad get fixed. The average people can learn about non average things any day. There are even dictionarys on the internet with many diffent translations that you would normily need about @NUM1 books to do. The computer is one of the greatest techlonagicly advances to this day.

1074,"Dear Newspaper, Computers today have a negative effect on people. The valuable time of getting daily exercise is reduced, you will not see your family enough and some of the costs are outrageous! Owning a computer is surely not a good idea. is sitting around all day your idea of a workout? Having a computer would be very bad for your physical lifestyle. Clicking a mouse & typing away are only moving your hands, not your whole body. An individual who doesn't use the computer daily, or f or large amounts of time would be healthier than someone who always uses the computer. I remember seeing a commercial about @NUM1 children & how their lives eneded up later on in life just by their computer usage as a ""tween."" Not only will you be unhealthy but anti-socialism is probable too. Many kids, or even adults, spend precious family time playing the sims @NUM2 creating their own ideal family. This however, is not acceptable. Spending time with your family is something precious. When asked about computer usage, @PERSON1 said, ""you could easily became addicted with just @NUM2 turns!"" @CAPS1 you are addicted, both your family & you suffer. They will stop inviting you places. You wouldn't want to loose the people who are going to be ther for you, on another what. ""@CAPS2!"" shouts your computer. You have another virus. uh oh, it's deleting your hardware: all your scholastic essays, important book-marked websites & sentimental photographs. Do you have any idea how much it would cost to even try to retrieve this data? Well, it'd be alot. I know youre probably thinking, ""This couldn't happen to me,"" but in reality; yes it can storing things on a computer is much riskier than having a hard copy. It will also save you more money. Furthermore, appliances use electricity @CAPS1 they're even plugged into an outlet! So when you get your electric bill, don't be surprised, computers can be very costly which, is why it's not worth it to have one. Computers are just another unnecessary thing in life. It will take away from your over-all health, reduce family time, & cost you same big bucks. It is a fact that you can survive without a computer. But without hjealth? Well, you'd be dead. I you to consider my ideas.",10
1075,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think the effects that computers have on people are bad, and should be stopped. I mean don't get me wrong computers help people, but a lot of people go on it everyday, some computers can get viruses, and there are much more activities to do other than on a computer. I hope to persuade you about the horrible effects a computer has on people. Do you know how many people use the computer? Well, according to @ORGANIZATION1 over @NUM1 billion people use a computer worldwide. The problem we are facing today is that too many people are on a computer, most of them are teens. According to @PERSON1 about @PERCENT1 of teens spend most of their time on an computer. Facebook, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 are the most common places to find teens. I would know that because I have a facebook myself. I've had one for almost a year, and you should see all the people who have one. My friend wanted me to get one because she said she had one one wanted me to get one too. So I did and then I found out that more then half of my grade had a facebook. In my own words I honestly think the computer can be addicting, especially when your on a worldwide account like facebook. There are many people on the computer and if must be stopped. In addition, another reason is computers occasionally get viruses. According to @CAPS3.com, the average adult gets about @NUM2 to @NUM3 viruses a year. My friend @PERSON2 was on his computer typing a report, and then his computer shut down. Then @NUM4 seconds @CAPS4 the computer said you have a virus. The next day @PERSON2 told me he didn't have his report because the virus wiped out all his information. About @PERCENT2 of viruses can cause a computer to shut down and it is hard to reboot it. Some places have made virus scans such as mcafee. and @CAPS5, but sometimes they can't catch the virus. @PERCENT3 of people who say that a virus was cought by the virus scan they have, their computer freezes up and you can't delete the virus, viruses must be terminated, so the computer can work properly. Thats another reason to why computers affect people in a bad way. Furthermore, people think that the computer is their everything. They're wrong! There is a lot of activities that they can do other than be on a computer. According to @CAPS6. Burn the average person between the ages of @NUM5 and @NUM6 spend more then @NUM7 hours on a computer. There are many other options of activities like call your friends and get together, that's why they invented the cell phone, play a sport, read a book, spend time with family for @PERSON3's @CAPS7! Don't spend all your time on the computer. About @PERCENT4 of teens who are on the computer alot tend to get into lower colleges later in life. That is my final reason of the bad effects a computer has. In conclusion, computers can cause a bad influence due to viruses, too much time on it, and not doing other things. I hope you can see my point to this and please send me a response as soon as possible.",10

These are the fantastic things you can do on the computer to have a better relationship. Your a highschool dropout because you cant keep up with the class. You dont turn in your homework and fail every test. Also, you feel that there is nothing you can do to fix it. Well not so fast my son! Now you can take online cources to boost up your grade and make you feel comfortable. Imagine sitting at the computer, completing every assignment and doing every homework there is. Watching your teacher teach, to you through a webcam. There's nothing like it, in fact you get the homework faxed to you. Someone in this world is living this life, it could be you. There's new websites all around the world today. However, there is no better website with all your friends on it. For example, myspace, facebook, and twitter. All websites that can stay in contact with your best friends. Another, that can be even more intrested is webcam. It's live from home fotage face to face on the computer. How cool is seeing your friend when your not together? Third of all, communication makes the world go around that why more and more people meet new friends. In sum, as you can see there's a lot of fun things you can do on a computer. It affects humans lives because more and more people are intrested in this device",9
1077,"Dear newspaper editor, I think computer are a benefit to everyone. My first reason why I think computers are abenefit is because if you don't know about somthing and you wana learn more about it, you can just go on the computer and do some research on it. The best part is you can research anything even if its like a million miles away. The internet has imformation on anything and every thing. my second reason why, is because if you have a webcam and some of your relatives live very far away you can see them when ever you want. Its not just webcam either you can also go on facebook and other sites like that to talk to family and friends and see pictures of one another. my last and final reason is that you can do almost anything on a computer. Their software on them to write, do projects, and plan things oct. plus most of the modern day society uses computers for stores and business's to keep track of things. Well thats why I think computers benefit us. I told you why I thought they did and how.",6
1078,"Dear Newspaper, I am writing to you @DATE1 because think computers really effect people in a bad way. I say this becuause @CAPS1 you go on the internet you do not get that much excirse. You also don't get good grades at all! That's bad thing. Plus when on a computer there are some really wierd people. I really want you guys to hear out my story. Go outside! @CAPS3 mom I'm on the computer! @CAPS1 your on the computer to much you want want to get exersce. @CAPS1 you don't get excise you won't be healthy! you want get excise. Also you will obese you don't want that! For instance when your in gym class you want to be healthy. So you can and you will get a good grade. Do you want a bad grades? That sums it up on. You got an @CAPS2! On your report card? When you spend alot of your time on a computer then you will get addicted. @CAPS1 you get addicted then you will not do your homework then your grades will drop. You will get bad grades in school. Then you have a possibilty to stay back. Plus then the parents to flipout on. This is one of my reasons why computers effect people in a bad way! When you go on the computer you have @CAPS3 clue who you are talking to unless your thier friends. There has been very many cases that kids getting stolen because of facebook and myspace. @CAPS1 your kid goes on those websites than your kids' always at danger! There are cyber and they could find out where you live that information about you. For instance there was a case on myspace that a kid thought she was talking to a @NUM1 year old boy she was really talking to a @NUM2 something year old guy. Then the girl went missing for about weeks. That was. So you can never trust a computer. When you take a real good look at computers you will see they are just @CAPS3 good. All my reasons before. They are you will not get nearly the amount of you are supose to. Your grade will plummet down @CAPS1 you stay on the computer and they trick you. So even know you can communicate with your friends. Its just not worth it.",8
1079,"Dear Newspaper, In my opinon I think computers do have a positive affect on people. They can learn about far away places. They let people talk online. It can even help you find a job. This is why I think computers are very positive. Certainly, people can learn about far away places on the computer. Say, someone wanted to take a trip to @LOCATION1 they can look it up, learn the launage. They can by tickets. They could also find interesting things to see in that country. These reasons are why I think a computer is a positive technology. My next reason I think a computer is positive toward people is that people can comuicate online. This can help keep families in touch. It can help you find and talk to old friends (facebook). You can even make new friends to talk to. These are other examples why I think computers are positive. My last reason I think computer have a positive affect on people is that it can help you with jobs. It can help you find a job. It can also help you with your job. Lastly, it can have you have a higher position at your job. These are my reasons I think computers are important and positive to people. For all the reasons above are reasons I think computers are an awesome =) and positive technology, I mean just look at all the reasons. They let people talk online. They can also teach you about far away places. And even help you with your job. This is why I think computers have a positive affect on people.",8
1080,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some people are debating whether advances in technology, such as computers, are benefitial to our daily life. I think that computers are a good addition to life for a few reasons. For one, information and knowledge are at your fingertips. It takes merely seconds to know anything you want or need to. Email, @CAPS2, @CAPS1, etc. can be labeled as wasteful or dangerous. New friends can be made everyday. Lastly, there can be limits set so no more worrying about to much time spent on the computers. One of the reasons computers can be benefitial to our daily life is what it can give us. Knowledge is just seconds away. Anything you might be interested in learning is all on the web. Homework, school projects, and even work need information that isn't found anywhere else. The library is a great place to find what you're looking for, but if you're in a hurry and need what you're looking for quick, there is the online encyclopedia, world book, etc.Technology is becoming a huge part of our life today, many opinions are up in the air about it. If, there's one thing everyone can agree on, it's fast and can make daily tasks easier. Ordering clothes, books, movies, tickets for trips and more all can be done online. That's not all the computer has to offer. Friends/family are a necessary part of life, but they're not always living right around the corner. They @MONTH1 live on the other side of the state, country, even world! @CAPS2, @CAPS1, email, etc. can allow you to connect with anybody around the world at anytime. E-mail has been around longer than other websites like @CAPS2 and myspce which allow you to keep daily tabs on them. @CAPS1 or ichat allows you to instantely talk to anybody that you want. These websites can't replace being together in person, but it can help keep in touch for the meanwhile. Some are worried about spending too much time face to face with the screen, there is even something to prevent that. Time spent inside on the computer is becoming a problem. Not enough exersise or time spent outside can be unhealthy. Time limits can fix this problem. A certain amount of time can be plugged in. When there's @NUM1 minutes left, it gives you a warning. That way more time can be spent outside in the open, and less inside staring at the screen all day. Many different opinions about whether computers belong in our life have been shared. I believe they're a beneficial part of our life. They allow you information at the touch of your fingers, access to friends/family, plus there's time limits. In this day/age, the computer is something we can't live without.",10
1081,"Now-a-days the technological industries are taking over the modern soceity and are captivating users making them virtually addicted. What good is that? These indulged in the online world are less interactive and showed more signs of depression in recent studies. Also if you are sitting around on the computer all day you aren't burning calories so you are gaining unnecessary weight that could easily be prevented. Going to the library is just as useful if not more useful than going on the internet. lastly, have you thought of the damaging affects, trojans, cyber bullying, violence? In other words, computers are just a negative waste of good money. Families are becoming less and less connected with each other, who's to blame. It's that big book of technology on your desk. Rather than socializing and just spending time with family and friends, computer addicts choose to sit on their butts talking and gaming away. They are teaching our family apart."" @CAPS1 one @LOCATION1 man on her two tennage children's computer obsession. ""I swear they're on that thing for hours on end"" she claims. In an artical I was reading the other day it said that most people who suffer depression admitted to being online for atleast @NUM1 hours per day. What does all of this go to show? Computers are abuse take them out of your child's life, or atleast limit them. Studies prove that @PERCENT1 of people who spend most of their day surfing the web have either over-weight or just on the boarderline of being over-wright. Rather than going into the real world and experiencing life for themselves, they look it up online and rely on other people's opinions. Does this mean anything to you? People who are overweight have a higher risk of aging, and if not, then they have some pretty health problems. All because they didn't want to breath like. When in a library environment people tend to be more and more on task. You @MONTH1 ask yourself the answer is simply that the is too expansive and distracting. If you are in the library you can't get in as much trouble, you can't play online games, or even be looking at things that are innappropriate. Libraries hae more credible sources and reliable information to study from. Not to mention you can go with a family, friend of even be tutored. Computers dont provide that. Going to the library is such a better solution. I must admit, I was before a computer addict, and believe me the effects it has on people are atracious. Now that I've moved on from that period of my life I can honestly say, the addictive grasp it has on you is strong I know. I also know first hand the rewards of being clean from this harmful drug per say. I am more sociable than ever and im dealing with issues much better. I am @NUM2 pounds and in the best shape of my life and I even made by school's cheer team. I often go to the library to study and I must say, im very proud of who I've become. I was spending around @NUM3 hours online and getting on sleep. If I can do it you can tool my name is @CAPS2 and im a computer addiction survivor.""",10
1082,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think computers are benefitial to society even though some people don't because they give us a means of communication, computers give us the ability to learn about forein people or places, and computers help businesses in so many ways. Computers are a most have in a society. Computers give us a means of communication such as @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6-mail, and so much more. Without the computer, families who live far away from each other can talk with a push of a button. @CAPS5 lets us talk to our friends after school and plan what we are going to do that night. Long distance calls cost money and it is not worth @MONEY1 a call if you call every couple of days. Communication has evolved so much in the past @NUM1 years. Computers are just the bigginning. That is why computers are benefitial to communication. Computers give us the ability to look up facts about forein places and people in a matter of minutes. We could look up who was the @CAPS7 of @LOCATION1 in the would get multiple sites on the @CAPS7. Computers help us expand our learning capabilities and give us a chance to learn things that normally we wouldn't. That is another reason why computers are very benefitial to the society. The last reason that supports the fact the computers are benefitial to the society is because computers help keep much of data. Work data and they help @PERCENT1 of businesses we file reports communicate with other branches of that company. I learned in class that in the job were much more difficult than they are today because of technology. Some people think that using computers deprives people of going out and exercising. It only takes @NUM2 minutes ti check your @CAPS6-mail, or look up something. Computers are benefitial to society because without computers, our lives would be much more complicated.",8
1083,"Do you have a computer? I'll bet @PERCENT2 of you do! You @MONTH1 spend @NUM1 hours on the computer or even @NUM2 hours! Computers in fact have many down-sides to them. You could be so invoilved that you never go outside or get excirsize. Also, sitting @NUM2 inchs from the computer screen does not help your eyes. Lastly, the internet has very inapropriot websites that kids should not be seeing. Are you a kid who spends @NUM4 to @NUM2 hours at a time on the computer? Well, if you are, it's time to get off the spinning computer chair and out for soem fresh air. Most kids spend most of their time on the computer @CAPS1 or on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3. It @MONTH1 be good for kids to interact with kids out of school but sooem kids take it way to far. They never go oitside and get any excirsize. this is not good for a growing teen. They need to be up and active. So, limit yourself time you spend on the computer. Without a doubt, computers are very bad fro youe eyesight. Unlike @CAPS4 or video games you could play a long distance away, a computer is played @NUM2-7 inches from the over time, your eyes will be so use to sitting @NUM2 inches from what your recating, that when you back up you  erad at all. I knew this who played video games from about @NUM8 foot away for long period of time a day. Today, unfortunately, the kid is blind if that kid just knew the consequences of being that close to a @CAPS4 screen, he would have thought twice about it. Think twice about how close you sit from the computer. if I were to ask anyone of you what you could find on the internet @PERCENT1 of you would say, ""anything."" could there really be too much information?

1085,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1, Computers have advanced our world so far into the future that practically everything is just a click away. Experts are awed that over the years, computers have helped billions of people get jobs done foster and smoother than ever before. Technology has helped doctors find new cures for patients, and diagnose their sicknesses in a more advanced way. Thousands of professions require the limitless knowledge of the internet, and computers continue to advance and redefine our way of living. Furthermore, kids of all ages benefit from modern computers. As technology becomes more user-friendly, children have adapted to computers giving them answers to all of their questions. As a student at @ORGANIZATION1, I have found that computers are vital in everyday assignments. Essays are now typed and not handwritten and projects are displayed on flash drives, not posterboard. Those advances have shaped our lives, and made everything much easier. Also, foreign places become closer to home, when computers allow you to virtually visit hundreds of different countries. With modern technology, the world is better connected and united. In addition to students, doctors also greatly benefit from computers. Technology has re-shaped the medical world dramatically with x-rays, @CAPS2's, surgeries and medicines. Amazingly, computers allow doctors and nurses to look at patients in a whole new way. Hospitals organize all records digitally to help give the right treatments patients. @PERSON1, the head surgean at @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""@CAPS3 technology, our @ORGANIZATION2 would be useless. We wouldn't be able to do anything."" @CAPS4 @PERSON1 is well-spoken, he makes a very important point. Computers are the building blocks of our medical world. Scientific studies have shown that the internet has brought people closer than ever before. Families separated by thousands of miles now have the ability to email, chat or even video chat with far away relatives and friends. Email has especially played a huge roll in our society, so as to help millions of people communicate when needed. Infact, over @NUM1 million jobs rely on email to communicate important business information. @CAPS3 the aid of technology, our economy would rapidly as communication countries failed to exist. Computers are essential to our culture. I strongly urge you to consider my opinion on the benefits of modern technology and think of all the people computers have helped. Our culture is now bigger, better, faster and stronger, thanks to the help of technology today. Knowing this, I vehimently suggest you educate others in the benefit of technology and play your part in advancing our way of living.",9
1086,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I as a computer user, think computers are helpfull in many ways. They help get new @CAPS3. They help function machines. They help people learn new things. Computers help find and get new @CAPS3. They provide the public in another way to find a new or another job. My brother; for example, @CAPS4 went to a university there @CAPS4 learned how to become a micanic. @CAPS4 was having a hard time finding a job, (looking for me on the street) so somone told him to go on @CAPS1.com and go to ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"" @CAPS4 did and there on the computer @CAPS4 found a good job and still works there. The computer or great way to find a job. Computers help function machines. All the machines that we have to use and had to run by hand now run by computers. That is good in someway and bad on another way. They help make more product in less time. Today more cars are being made in less time if you've seen sometimes in of cars you saw the assemble line with michanical robot hands putting them together and that is using computers. One major problem to this is many people are lossing their @CAPS3. The computer teacher people",8
1087,"@ORGANIZATION1, my name is @PERSON1 and i just want to tell you that we should stop using computers because we get no exercise, we barely go outside and we don't even or talks to our friends or family any more. Local newspaper i think that we should have computer but not because many people aren't doing anything. Many people aren't exercising because their taking on facebook or playing games. Many children aren't even going outside and seeing nature and playing. Many families are all on computers and they are not spending any family time together gofly kites. What im saying is that yeah people like computers and go and talk to there friends and play games but its destroying the parents and and even families. i don't think have computers. Also local newspaper we need to go and the @DATE1 and go doesn't happen. many children go they're on the computer. many parents go hiking, camping, swimming and lots of other stuff but they that anymore. These people need to get a change. What im talking you guys is take the computer away or. One last thing local newspaper is that many kids and children and parents need to have more time. Maybe if and parents weren't all they they would pick that might be sick or ill. Maybe they might go out somewhere to have two together like lake or six flags. many parents that they get computer because it's so fun so they. Many people world complain about it. So i think everybody should be off computers. i think we shouldn't have computer society because you get no exercise, you barely go outside and see nature and you hang out or talk with friends and family so i think computers gone now.",8
1088,"Hi! I am writing in which computers are a bad thing to the society or good thing. I think that computers are good thing to have around. They help us in a lot of way and they also help us find new friends and new updates. This is going to be my first opinion. I think that computers have effects on the society in a good way because people can find @CAPS1 of the latest updates on the weather, society and country's. It helps the society in a good way because people don't have to look though an old Newspaper. All they have to do is click and there there reading it all and probally seeing pics and stuff of it. This is my second reason why computers are a good effect on the society they help us in a lot of ways on which meeting new people and staying in close good with them and talking with them and sending pics of stuff and you. My last opinion for computers are a good effect on society is that @CAPS2 you have a buissness or anything you can sell any of your merchandise, keep buiness plans, And also you can make a website for your business after a while @CAPS1 of people will know about it and it would make a really big inpack on your buiness.

1089,"Computers do not have a negitive effect on people. They keep you in touch with family, help you do work for school, also allow you to play video games and look up music. Computers can keep you in with family and friends. Find locations to where the live. How their doing and what have they been up to. It allows you to e-mail and lets you see friends that moved far away. Computers also help you to work for school. They help you find answeres to questions a teacher could ask. They help you write reports or reports in general for any subject. Also, there many site that you could go to; to help you with a book.The sites could also bring you to your schools website. That way, if you forgot your home work was you have a place to check. Even if you were absent most papers I questions are on the internet so you could make end to the homework. Another common thing computers are used ten is to weecth movies. Rather a old movie or a new release. Computers also do the same thing for music. Anything from @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 to country and back can be. or new @CAPS3 shows and music all be find. Video games are also popular. Many people play these because; people can friends. Talk to friends that they havent seen in a long time. They to not be bored. If it's raining out and nothing to to the here games.

1090,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe computers are a huge benefit to society. I myself have a computer; it is very important and useful to me. Over @PERCENT1 of the families in our town own at least one computer. Computers are a great source of information. They also allow you to talk to people, even if they are far away. They are also very convenient and easy to use, in mu opinion. Based on these positives, @CAPS3't you agree with my opinion? Computers are a great source of information. Unlike books, which you must find and buy, there is an enormous amount of information just a mouse click away! With computers, you can learn about far away places and people without having to visit or talk to them. Let me compare this to a book. Let's say you wanted to do research on @PERSON1. You would have to go to the library and search for a book about him. And what would you do if you couldn't find one about him? With a computers you could type ""@CAPS2 of @PERSON1"" into a search engine and receive of information in under a minute! I love saving time, and computers help me do that. They also augment the information I use. Another astounding development in computer technology is that you can talk to other, no matter where their location is. Email is extremely faster than writing a letter. having to pay to travel. Who @CAPS3't like that? Computers are very convenient. You can surf the internet, talk to people, and much more from the comfort of your bedroom. There are jobs that you can do from home on a computer. No need to go anywhere to work. My uncle is one of those people. He is s stockbroker, and operates his whole job from the computer in his house. It is a convenient and a well-paying job. I asked him what he thought of his job. He said, ""I love my job because I can work when I want to work, and from the comfort of my home."" @CAPS3't you want to have his job? I would most definately. In conclusion, computers are very beneficial to us. Did you know computers were first invented by @ORGANIZATION1 to perform calculations that were very long? Look at what they have involved into @DATE1. They bring us information at amazing speeds. They let us talk to people all over the world. They are very convenient.

The question then is, @CAPS1 computers have good effects or bad effects on people. The obvious answer is bad effect. People constantly use the computers teach them bad habbits and can search inappropriate things. IF people are always playing games the computers then when @CAPS1 they go out for a jag. The answer is never. People who are constantly on the computer don't get enough exercise. One reason why a lot of people in @LOCATION1 are obese is because they aren't getting enough exercise. Computers aren't helping this situation at all. Some people say, ""@CAPS2 I'll just spend an hour on the computer and then I will go work out."" But, the one hour on the computer turns into two hours, and then two hours turns into three, you know it you've wasted the wrote day on the computer and didn't exercise at all. Also, there are so many games on the computer now that can be really and you don't to stop playing them. Yes some games can be really entertaining, but you don't have to spend all day playing them. You can play a fun game for fifteen minutes and then go get air. As you can computer can mesmorised a lot so they don't get enough exercise. Second, people go on bad habbits. For example, kids are always. On the website you can talk to your friends. On the computer the problem is that people dont use the. Too much and get too used writing like that. Then, kids @MONTH1 start doing that on writing in school and most even know it. Also, there are new websites where you can put personal information about yourself. This makes it easy for strangers to. learn your. Lastly is very easy for people, even to search inappropriate things. Everything is on the internet and little kids are going to be very curious about it. They can search inappropriate words ad pictures and no one would ever know. people can past inappropriate information on their own for others to see that can be impossible to take. And, if parents don't know that their children are searching inappropriate things, then the kids are going to keep doing it because they know they wont get caught. So, as you can see computers have a very negative effect on people. It causes individuals to no easy to inappiopriate things. So go and limit the time you on computer.",9

I firmly belive that computers have major effect on people, my three reasons are people don't have the exersise, they dont interact with others, kids are smocky they will sneak on if doing research for if wasnt . Online websites and games are like hipnotysing the people and making them stay on for hours.

Buth with websites that make people stay conect for more than two hours they dont get fresh air and they dont interact with others . Most times people forgot and dont know what something is except for how a computer because they play on it so much. People grow up fast when you think about it, and people start to eat, drink, sometimes sleep at the computer. People stay at the computer and eat their, they wont get enought exercise, they will start to get fat and soon an only stay at the computers because they didnt exercise burn the fat off.

If someone to a country that they have they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and their culture. Another thing they might do @CAPS1 go to a website that could help them find affordable . If a child @CAPS1 doing a report about a country in @LOCATION1 thay can go on the computer to find out facts on that country.

Before computers stores would have to do math in their pad when they were giving change back to people, now people save by punching in the numbers in the computer.

When you just want to see someone I'l costs you money to get on a phone . with computers you can , or onstant message people with any costs. If you want to see a friend for her @CAPS9 but dont have the money to fly halfway around the world to see her you can vidieo chat with her.

Furthermore, on the computer you and all you clients can hold a conference call. Doing this allows you to relax and multitask while your computer is feeding you coverage of the call in crystal-clear sound. Normally a phone would have to be glued to you ear but now you hands free. Another time where computers are handy is at tax time. Tired of running around your house to find you car bill from three months ago? Well, with a spreadsheet software like @ORGANIZATION1, taxes can be calculated in along with their name, so when you take the taxes to tax consultant, everything is organized. Using these tools cut down an stress and leaves you less frustrated. And even better, you can buy a tax program for you computer, so you never have to leave your couch! Think about, paying somebody to count your taxes year after year, when you can save a fortune and do it yourself. Above all, computers help you connect with old friends who have moved away or parted ways earlier in life. Now, the internet contains many social networking sites, such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 where you can reunite with lost pals. These networks also offering access to photosharing and chat, so everybody can see how your family is and vice versa. Along with this is video chatting, where you can have face to face conversation with somebody even on the other side of the world. This is totally private, so it isn't dangerous to say names of family members or their locations. The internet truly is an amazing tool! To conclude, the internet holds a very strong role in our daily lives. Not only can we see who man the @ORGANIZATION2 game, but it also has interactive business softwares as well. Never again will work be so difficult. Also, the computer has programs to help you manage expenses, keeping you on top of your game. Finally, it is also helpful for all the tools that can be used to interact with friends thousands of miles away. I believe the computer is critical for success and happiness in life. It's a new age, let's adapt to it.",12
1095,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I agree that computers do have a positive effect on people. I agree, because being on the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination, helps people learn about faraway places and people, and allows people to talk to other people. By being on the computer it helps teach people hand-eye coordination. So the computer help with hand- eye coordination by using the mouse and keyboard. For example, when you use a computer you dont need to look at your hands while you use the mouse. That helps with hand-eye coordination, because you can see where your hand is without looking. Another example is the keyboard, because while learning where all the keys are you memorize them. Then soon you can type with without looking. The computer also helps you to learn. When you go on the computer the thing people go on is the internet. On the internet people can find information about faraway places or people. So, because the computer has different links and websites, it helps kids and adults everywhere to get information fast. Without the computer everyone would have to go to a library, but what if they didnt have the right information? Then you would need to trace around everywhere to find a book. Thats why a computer is handy. Also, the computer allows people to stay in touch with others farther away. One example of this is that there are chat rooms or groups people can join. So, if a relative or friend is farther away from a more or if they are down the street, with chat rooms it makes talking easier. Also, by these chat rooms and groups it makes a lot of people happy knowing that they can still talk with an old friend or relative instead of loosing them from never seeing or talking to them. That is just another example why the computer has a positive effect. So, with the examples of the computer helping teach hand-eye coordination, makes obtaining information easier and of the many reasons and examples of the computer having a positive effect.",8
1096,I think that will are all spending to much time in computers because all of my frend are all day in @CAPS2 I think that people should get active and go to different places in the wold like the pool the forect the lackes ets.

1097,"With the click of a mouse, you can access the internet. Computers and internet are a recent innovation. You could probably find one in a common household. They've improved and gotten popular within the last twenty years. I believe they greatly benefit society. Computers provide an easy way to learn and communicate. Think about how life would be in the @DATE1 without computers. Different, right? I don't think I could have written such a great research paper without the use of a computer. The internet has many helpful sources; such as databases, encyclopedias, and articles. You can find information on almost any topic. The computer makes this easier for us to do. You can just search key words, and you have what you're looking for. Its faster than skimming through twenty books. Once you find what you're looking for, you can paste it into a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 document and print it. It's as easy as that. Another benefit of computers is communication. I have found this important over the last few years. A family that I have been close to my whole life had moved to @LOCATION1 due to jobs. Thanks to internet, I have been able to keep in touch with them. Im sure thousands of other people have been in the same situation. Whether it's on email, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messanger, or facebook, people can communicate with others all around the world. It's more convienent than having to time your phone calls so it's a good time for both of you. If we didn't have this connection with forgein countries, everyone’s lives would be different. Computers haven't just changed personal lives. They change the medical field too. This has greatly benefitted our society. Scientists and doctors find out new discoveries and what advances have been taking place. Doctors use computers to plan and perform surgery procedures. Computers have helped advance and improve the medical research and diagnosis. This saves the lives of many people. @PERCENT1 of tests that have taken place to research a dicsease use a computer of some sort to break it down. The technology of computers has benefitted today’s society and has helped people achieve great things. It keeps people all over the world connected and helps them learn. I hope that you see how computers have molded and helped the world today.",11
1098,"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 when you were a kid? There weren't any computers or other electronics except the telephone. The computer is very advanced and helps people in many different ways, such as: hand-eye cordination, learning and being able to talk online. These things benefit society and prove the advancement in technology. The computer teaches hand-eye cordination when people don't even realize @CAPS5, through typing whether typing an email or an essay your hands are working and helping you. The hand-eye cordination that people learn on a computer can be used for sports. @PERSON3, a @NUM1 years old tennis player, said, ""I used to go on the computer everyday and play tennis later, and eventually the computer helped use with my favorite sport."" Hand-eye cordination is very useful, for many things our surveyed @NUM2 people and @NUM3 of these people say that hand-eye cordination is a very important still and that everyday activities, such as computers, help them improve. Typing is very comonly used while sending emails because they are fast, fun, and let you comunicate. When talking on a computer there are many new ways that are popular and fast, such as email welcoms aim, facebook and many more. @CAPS5 is nice to be able to talk to friends and family online because other options are more expensive. For example, many live on @LOCATION1 and her sister, @PERSON4, she is very close to, lives in @LOCATION3. They can't talk to each other a lot because neither of their calling plans allow them to call without charging hundreds of more money. They also can't fly to use each other because plane tickets are expensive these days. Also, the economy isn't doing that great, so they couldn't stay in-touch until webcams come out. Now, they see each other almost every week. Many said, ""I was considering flying to @LOCATION3, but now the webcams and email are useful and save us both a lot of money."" People @MONTH1 argue that you can just sent letters to each other, but, you can't send your baby boys first steps that you just video taped, or a youtube video that is really cute. Also, you can meet new people online that you @MONTH1 not've seen normally and when you can stay in touch, you can stay much closer to each other. Even though computers are great for fun, working and learning are much easier online. When online, everything that can be learned is amazing whether @CAPS5's what means or the earthquake in @LOCATION4. Being able to keep track of everything in one computer is amazing. @PERSON2, a @NUM4 @CAPS3 teacher at @LOCATION2, says, ""@CAPS4, we are trying to make more things electronic to protect the planet, so use don't waste paper and will trees."" @CAPS5 is true, about @PERCENT1 of the homework of @NUM5 graders is online, whether @CAPS5 is to look up the equation for photosynthesis on to find out what year @CAPS6 died in being online does help the environment @CAPS5 is important to be able to have computers in schools because @CAPS5 gives more chances for kids to learn more things faster, like @NUM6 graders have a math class online, off hey math. @CAPS5 gives people more information coming from more people. Online, you can read a scientists' expierement or a paparatzi's take on @PERSON1' new boyfriend. The computer has changed society a lot, for the better. Now, in the @DATE1, computers are part of the everyday lives of people in which they benefit. With better hand-eye cordination, being able to talk your friends, and being able to learn the computer benefits society.",11
1099,"@CITY1 @CAPS1, Computers are very helpful devices. Life would be very hard without them. Not only are the helpful, but they are fun and easy to use! I believe that computers have a great effect on people because you can keep in touch with family and friends, go on school websites and use search engines. Friends and family are extremely important in peoples lives. Computers can help you keep in touch with them! the @NUM1 applications that I mostly use are @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. @ORGANIZATION1 is a free online application that you can download to your computer, add your friends, and video chat! using this, I keep in touch with my @CAPS4, my friend who moved, and even a friend from @LOCATION2! @CAPS2 (@ORGANIZATION3 instant messeger) is where you can send messages to friends and get instant replies! It is just like text messaging, only through computers. Lastly, @CAPS3 is a website where you can add friends from all around the world! I am friends with tons of family that I don't get to see very often, a friend who moved to @LOCATION3, and many other people that have moves! @CAPS3, @CAPS2, and @ORGANIZATION1 are great ways to keep in touch with other people! When you are home sick from school and need to make up school work, instead of calling a friend from each of your classes, go to the school's webpage! All teachers should have their own website that you can get from there. On their pages, they should have posted homework, quizzes/tests schedule, favorite links, projects, and their e-mail address. I find this very helpful because even if you don't understand you homework, you can e-mail you teacher! Not only do school website have teachers pages, but they also have lunch menus, events coming up, the school address and phone number, and many more! School could be a lot more difficult without a website. Do you ever have a question but nobody has the answer to it? www.Google.com has the answer to everything! you can find webpages, videos, pictures, translators, etc. Google is not the only search engine on the internet, there is also @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION2!, @LOCATION4, @CAPS7, @LOCATION1, etc. These can all help you find answers, pictures, videos and many more! I often use these to find pictures for a school project, webpages for research, translators to check my spanish homework and videos to show my friends! if we did not have search engines, life would be a lot harder. Computers, as you can tell, are extremely helpful, easy, and fun to use. People love them and use them all the time. I hope that you agree with computers having a great effect on people! Staying in touch with family and friends, having a good education, and finding answers within a click is the easiest way to go!",11
1100,"Dear Newspaper, I disagree that computers are important to people because they have research, online colleges, and online stores. Those are my top @NUM1 reasons and I'm going to give more details. My first main idea is that computers help students find important information help students find important information on a project. You can do on the wikepedia to help find information about the battle of @LOCATION1 and other important history. one example is I went to american history.com to find good information about @CAPS1 alley @CAPS2 and what happened there. People also look up a lot of stuff that involves school. You can get research about the earth and what happens to it. My second main idea is that computers are good for people is when you finish high school, you can go to college. Some colleges can be found on the internet and you can go to college at home on your computer. One example is my cousin. She goes to college on the internet because she has to take care of her two children. Whenever you watch television you see a commercial about online colleges because they are trying to tell you to go to school online. My third and final reason why computers are good for you people is that some stores have an online store where you can look at what they have in the store. Children like to go shopping alot but they can't go to the mall or the stores because you don't want to go. You can let them see what they want and buy it online than going to the stores. It can be shipped to your door without going anywhere. My mom sometimes orders from @CAPS3.C @CAPS4 so she doesn't have to go there. It gets shipped to our house in less than a week. There was my @NUM1 main reasons why people should have a computer. They can find research, online schools, and online shopping stores. This can help people understand computers.",8
1101,"Dear newspaper people I think computers are good because wat if I have a family member that gose out of town and you want to stay in tuch and I dont have a phone then I can go-on a chatting web sight and stay in with them.

Computers are good were ever you go, it can look up for a project for school. Bur ween you are in school it can help you with spelling, and if u got to know wat contrey has the most people the @CAPS2 will find the ancer as fast as a snap. Computers are advanceing every year. Seart the @CAPS2 was just a screan and a mouse, now we got laptops that you can tack every were. People can get exercis if thay want and thay can enjoy nature thay can bring a laptop. But when you are exercising then you can go right to youtube and lison to some musick and wach funny videos. And thats whay I think computers are good.",6
1102,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2, more and more people in our proud and courageous country of @LOCATION1 have been. Computers were mode to simply difficult situations, such as typing, finding, , and keeping a record of financial statuses. Despite the main uses, many @CAPS3 citizens have been using the computer for that are neccessary which result in a loss of to living a healthy, social, life. these are exercisem and spending line with fellow people indicating family and friends. as a result, please read on so that you, the @CAPS4 our can understand why computers have became out of hand and relay my message to the readers of your. One much life is exercise, and due to the of modern computers, exercise is the key to a healthy life. Personally, I know at least poor young children in my very school that are a victim of the cruel disease, known as obesity. The reason for the dese children is quite simple-they over use, and forget the natural bounderies to using something. Practically every day, each of the foor heart- children begin to their computers from the second will home, to the moment they fall asleep. this outrageous number of hours the vital the to exercise, therefore allows their bodies to adopt to the habits of the children sleep, eat, computer. This upselling manor of the foor kids enables others to pick on them for being fat, yet they can't fight back, they have what so ever, thus the over use of computers can result in a over weight child, with no exercise, and no power/ muscle to depend themselves from. Another reason whay computers are thinking such a @LOCATION1's youth, is because of less than medicine usage of. Everyday I chose to walk from school, for the breathly sounds of type of wheather day should I hope you I @CAPS5, spending time with your friend and family yet ones again people who abuse see the importance of this. Around two years ago, I was on the computer non-stop, @CAPS6, playing video games, and all sorts of computer-released activities. every day, constantly, for about a year, I came home, to on the computer, and began my , as I @LOCATION2. This resulted loosing the time I had with my mosue. Furthermore, if I needed is contact @MONTH1 friends, I just @CAPS7 them, rather than speaking in person,. Over line both my family and friends and grow of this electronic device, called the computer luckily, @ORGANIZATION1 nothing like that now however, I hope that you see the side to the computer, and how loosing your family and friends possibly. In conclusion, @ORGANIZATION1 guarantee that with all the information about how are out. Hopefully you will the paper of @CAPS1 of our newspaper and demand a column about computer loose the valuable time for exercise, nature, and family & friends. Thank you for letter, and I will an article relative to this subject.",11
1103,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 has been a debate on whether modern computer activities are good for people or bad for the people. Some people think that it benefits society because computers can teach hand eye coordination, they can help people learn about faraway places, and allow people to interact with friends. Al of this seems to prove that computers are good for society, but truely it is not. People who use their computers too much can have some harmed side effects, including obesity, red eyes, and even can get cyber bullied. People are using computers to an extent to which it is bad for their health. The number one problem of the @LOCATION1 is obesity. It seems that people are getting fatter every day. Computers are definetly taking part in the problem. People are spending too much time on their computers and are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. These people are spending hours and hours in front of a computer getting heavier every day. They start to eat their feelings because of how lonely they are. This process continues until the certain person can barely yet out of their chair. Obesity is not the only problem that is damaging their health, their eyes are being damaged also. It is obvious that more & more people are having problems with @CAPS2 eyes everyday. Computers are making this happen. When a certain person is on the computer for only an hour, they are damaging their eyes tremendously. The computer screen is straining their eyes horribly & for the people who are on the computer @NUM1 - @DATE1 hours a day are pretty much sending their eyes to blindness. When I go onto the computer for only @NUM2 minutes my eyes start to water. It is a devastating outcome of using a computer too much. Computers are damaging peoples health & @CAPS2 should be something done about it. Although computers aren't only damaging people health they are also ruining peoples lives. Bullying has been a major problem in the @LOCATION1 for many years. Kids would be bullyed all day in school and always had a horrible time. But when they got to go home they could be comforted by their family and friends. Computers have recently included a system where you can video chat with friends or @ORGANIZATION2. This can be a wonderful thing unless used in the wrong way. As I pointed out before kids are bullied a by in school but when they got home they were able to leave that horrid life behind and be a normal kid. Not any more. This new @ORGANIZATION2, video chat, @CAPS4, etc. has brought the unlucky bullied students a one way ticket to getting cyber bullied. I have heard of a case where a student was cyber bullied to such an extent that she suicided on the internet to show how depressed she was. Computers made that event possible. Video chat, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. gives bullies a chance to make their prey depressed into a point where they consider suicide. I can understand why you would contradict my argument but I truely hope that you will be able to understand why this is so important. Obesity, straining the eyes, & cyber bullying should be in my mind enough evidence that computers are bad to get you to write an article about these horrid machines. They are causing a variety of problems in peoples health, mind, etc. I really hope you will consider writing this article.",10
1104,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2’t you think computers help society? I do I strongly belive computers help society and are being used for very good purposes. They help people of all ages. Its easyer for kids to look up information for @CAPS3, gives kids some good facts to help build knowlege and not only would it help kids but it will help adults too. Its easy to see why adults think kids dont read enough however kids get more than enough reading done on the computer. some parent think that just because kids arent going to the library to take a book out for their report they arent gaining knowlege but they are gaining knowlege because all of the things they could look up in a library they have availible to them on the computer. Computers help kids around the world find thing quickly and easily. Not only does the computer give them knowlege of things that happen in the past but also things happening in current times. It can also give kid information like weather updates that help to keep then safe. Over @PERCENT1 of the things you can find at the library you can finf on the computer. Some parents think that kids arent getting enough exencise but never the less they are also skiping out on a lot of knowlege and important facts also. On the computer you pick up a lot of facts such as wether updates natural desasters how to help others in need and other very important facts. If it was't for computers kids would not make up for all the knowlege they miss in school. on make up for what they miss when they are dosent. Computers help people everywhere gain knowlege. Not only have computers helped kid but they also help adults. They can do work over the computer look at houses, cars and lots of other important things. Certenly @CAPS1 you would not want to take away all of things knowlege and help being given to hot kids and adult on the computer. It helps aldults especialy keep thing going in there baissy lives. It also helps than make changes such as how they eat or act @CAPS4 are some reasons penale should not disaprove of computers because they help kids with @CAPS3, give kid important facts and, help people of all ages. sarely some of @CAPS4 facts could helpchange,",8

1106,"Dear local Newspaper, To my understanding computers have been putting a bad effect on people of all ages. In my opinion staying on the computer all day can cause you to miss out on outdoor activities. Also if you sit on a chair all day, honestly what will happen to you? You will become less active. In past experiences I have learned that if you get interested in computer game it will come very addicting. Computer put negative affects on people of all and I think we should stop and think about what we are doing. Most likely if you stay on the computer all day you will indeed on activities such as sports. @CAPS2 example @PERCENT1 of americans play soccer. In the beatiful fall when the leaves are beatifully changing you will miss out on playing soccer and the beaty of the leaves because of the computer you can't get your eyes off of. Another breathtaking adventure that you @MONTH1 miss out on is hiking. Hiking can be amazing when you get to the top and you see on the houses that have people like you (cach potatoes) sitting inside on the computer. Simple activities can be lost because of an addicting game you call fun. The computer is like a cause and effect. You @MONTH1 think you just playing farm town or chating on facebook, but in feture you will be missing out on the beauty of nature and sports. To connect @CAPS1's with missing out on sports because of the computer that will cause you to become over weight. A recent study showed that @PERCENT2 of children are obeased because of computer games. You @MONTH1 be thinking how, but I have a friend named named, @PERSON1 and he used to love to play out side and play sports until came out @CAPS2 the computer. Now he way @NUM1 pounds and he is only @NUM2. Honestly sitting in a chair all day will cause you to not be active and gain weight. Do you want this to happen to you? Help me tell others how computers cause a negative effect on others. Lastly playing on the compter or chatting with friends on @ORGANIZATION1 can cause you to @CAPS2 example if your talking to your girlfriend in spain who is there @CAPS2 callage I garentee your going to put off school work, @CAPS3 and other @CAPS4 that need to be done. In the end it will end up being time @CAPS2 bed and you got nothing done weather it was because you were trying to get to level @NUM3 or talking with your girlfriend you will have nothing accomplished.

All in all the computer is a bad thing such as useful piece of technology can cause you to miss out on events such as sports. Also it leads to being overweight sense your not getting active. Finally the computer is bad @CAPS2 your eyes and can cause you to procastonate. Help me help yourself avoid all of these bad effects caused from the computer.",9
1107,"Have you ever had the time completely fly by while you're on the computer? You go on at @TIME1pm and all of a sudden it's seven at night. People should spend less time on the computer because they should be outside, it takes away time with your family, and there are other ways to look up information. You should be outside, enjoying the fresh air and playing sports, not stuck inside all day with your eyes glued to a screen. When you're on the computer all day, you're just sitting there. You're not moving around at all. Seventy-two percent of kids who spend all their time on the computer are over weight. Being on the computer on a beautiful is like blocking out the birds' songs on the first day of @DATE1. Nature is amazing, and you should be outside enjoying it, not cooped up in a stuffy room leaning over a man-made machine. People should spend a lot less time on their computer. When you're on the computer, time really flies by. You lose your whole day to it, and wouldn't you rather be doing something more fun? You can be alone on the computer in a dark room. You should be with your family and and friends. Computers are going to be around for a long time, and when they die down it will only be because something better came along. Your baby brother won't be a baby forever and your grandparents might not even be there tomorrow. Don't you want to spend as much time as you can with them? You're changing too, so you @MONTH1 be off to college or have to move far away for buissness. ""They grow up so fast. They're adults in a blink of an eye."" my grandma said to my mom. Almost @PERCENT1 of parents feel that same way. So, don't spend all your time alone with a machine, be with your loving family and chairish each moment. People should spend less time on the computer because there are other ways to look up information and learn about new places. There are so many books in the world, about any topic you can imagine. Using books to look up information is better than typing in the word into google because it's important to learn how to use an index and find the book on the shelf. A trip to the library @MONTH1 not be your cup of sunshine, so if you want to learn about a place, why don't you go to that place? If you're doing a report on @LOCATION2 for school it would be a lot of fun to go to @LOCATION2 for a few days to learn about it. And you can take pictures with your own camera, not just a picture you found online. It would be a really fun family trip. Even if you're doing your report on a place as boring as @LOCATION1, you could still probably have a lot of fun, hanging out with your family together. In conclusion, people should spend less time on the computer and more time being outside, with family, and at really fun places. Why would you want to stare at a screen all day when you could be having this much fun?",11

When your in school, you need to type lots of @CAPS1 prompts, @CAPS2 labs, and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 vocab. Computers help us do that. Typing fast and correctly takes practice. Typing without looking at the keyboard is hand-eye coordination. This will help us later on in life also.

I didn't know a lot about the history of @LOCATION3 so I sat down at my desk and turned on my computer. Suddenly, it was like I was in @LOCATION3! I read about the delicious food and rich culture. I took a virtual tour of the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and the great @CAPS7. I heard @CAPS8 music and learned some @CAPS8. In just @NUM2 hour I visited @LOCATION3 right from my very own house! Computers can take you on a magical journey to a far away country. Computers allow people to talk to online with other people. This is a very good thing. I have cousins who live in @LOCATION2 and because of the @NUM3 hour time difference, its not always easy to talk on the phone so we use the computer. My family will send e-mails back and forth with them. Sometimes we will even video chat! @CAPS3 networking sights accesible by computer such as @CAPS10 or @CAPS11 allow us to talk to people who we don't regularly see. On @CAPS11 you can even talk to your favorite stars or musicians. Computers let us keep in touch with others. Computers have a positive effect on people. Some experts @MONTH1 say that people spend too much time on the computer and while that @MONTH1 be true to some people, its not true to everyone. We still exersise, and spend time outside. We still interact with family and friends but know we are also able to do so on the computer. More and more people using computer is a good thing.",10
1109,"Dear @CAPS1, I do not think people use the computer to much. I think this because some use them for work, some use them for school, and some use it to talk to family or friends that are not so close to them. Firstly, most buinesses need computers to keep the buisnesses up and running. Like were my mom works she needs the computer for pay roll, inventory, e-mailing the works about jobs, and to look up companies to supply concrete, stone, tricks, etc. Buisness people have excuses to have to use computers all the time. Most buisness people also use computers to plan buisness trips. Secondly, kids in school use computers to do homework, class work, research for projects, or to go and study island and education. Some kids can choose to use the computers improperly but at the same time interesting. Like how cells divide into smaller cells how body systems work or how a girl or boy is made from embrio to birth. In addition, most people use computers. Like @CAPS2 people use @CAPS2 to talk to on the other side of the world or you can use aim. I have both cell phone to call and text people that live far away. I use aim to talk to all my friends, I use to face with. So, don't say all people are on the computer to much and for the wrong reasons, because that is not true at all. Finally, altho all people are always on the computer it is must likely to talk to friends you haven't seen in a while or for work issues, and for school related work. In my opinion all people will always use the computer because it is the way of life now a days. So, I don't think there are any affects on anyone because we all use it to our benifits.",9
1110,"Dear, @CAPS1 I believe that people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer because they do less exercising, they don't interact with friends and family, and its bad for their health. People shouldn't spend so much time. They wont enjoy their life outside of their houses. My first reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is that its bad for their health. Spending to much time on their computers can strain your eyes. Some people with seizures including myself would trigier an attack and cause us to space out. Spending to much time on the computer can mess up your vision or damage your body. To me thats very unhealthy. Another reason why spending so much time on the computer is bad is that you don't interact with your family and friends. On the computer all the time can make you forget to spend time with your friends and family. You would get addicted to being on the computer all the time. You would forget to say hi and how are you to your family. You won't spend time with your friends and they will start to ingnore you and think that you don't care about them. Being on the computer all the time will mess up your soical activitys with other people. My final reason why spending to much time on the computer is bad is that your not enjoying nature. You don't realize how much you are missing because you are on the computer. Yes you can learn thinks by the computer but you can also learn by doing it yourself. Being on the computer to much will make you not want to exerise and that won't be good for your body. You would forget to at least go for a jog, discover new thing. You realize that exploring nature is better than just watching it. Those are my reasons why spending to much time on the computer is bad. Its not health. You don't interact will your friends or family. Also you won't enjoy nature for yourself. So just get off the computer and enjoy what life gave you.",8
1111,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers have really made an impact on society. Some people, think they have made a good impact while others think the opposite. I believe that they are a good thing in our lives and have made a drastic, but great impact. Some reasons that support my opinion are that computers are basically what helps us keep in touch with people, they make it very easy to find needed information and they make our school lives faster and much simpler. First of all, computers are pretty much how people keep in touch. There are many ways you can keep in touch over computers. Tere is video-chatting, e-mail and chat websites such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 etc. There are many people that really enjoy having the ability to keep in touch this way. It is a step up from talking on the phone. On the computer if you are web-chatting, you can not only talk to them, but you can see them! When it comes to chatting websites such as @CAPS2, there are millions of people who belong to this incredible website and love it. Kids and adults really enjoy having access to something like this. For me, since I moved to @STATE1 and had to leave all my friends behind, the computers has saved some of my relationships that I thought I would lose but didn't want to. I can e-mail my friends, and even see what they look like and how much they have changed on @CAPS2. Computers are a very helpful piece of technology that have helped me, and so many other people keep in touch. Another important reason computers are a wonderful technology item is because they make it so easy to find needed information. From what a word means, to the directions to get to @LOCATION1, the computer can help with all of this. I talked to my mom and she said. ""Computers just make @CAPS6 all of the information I need to knew about your brother's diabetes so easy."" @CAPS6 information in books can take so long. You have to go to the library or a bookstore, find the book you need with the correct information, and then you have to read through the whole book to find the information needed. On a computer, you can just google what you need to find, and read the article or map, etc. Computers have made @CAPS6 information a breeze and everyone loves how simple it is! The last reason that supports my opinion is that computers make our school lives faster and much simpler to deal with. In school, there are times when we need to write a very lengthy composition, and it will take forever to write. With a computer, typing up the composition would probably take around half the time of writing the composition. I took a survey of three kids that typed a composition and three kids that wrote it. I asked each of the kids how long it took them. The kids that wrote the paper said it took them around two hours. The kids that typed the composition said it took them around an hour. Also, when things are typed, they are usually easier to read which makes it easier for teachers to grade, and won't take as long. Computers make school easier for students and teachers. The opinion that computers are not a benefit to society just doesn't make sense. Yes, I know that there can be some disadvantages. But think of all the advantages compared to the disadvantages. There are a lot more good than bad things. Without computers, people would be incredibly stressed, and have a hard time making life easier. Computers are an amazing benefit to society. Everyone should agree with this because people stayin touch because of computers, computers make it very easy to find information that needed, and they make our school lives aint easier and faster for students and teachers. Computers have made an extremely large impact and changed our ways of life for the better!",10
1112,"Dear Local @CAPS1, I have been infromed that people don't get to talk to friends/family, enjoy nature and exercise because of computers. Well computers benefit our life. The first thing about/ computers is communication. People can use @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and etc. The social networking groups are for abilities to talk to friends, long distance or close and family enjoy research. Just because @CAPS11 use those internet websites doesn't mean @CAPS11 can't go outside and enjoy activities. This leads to other objects called peortables. As technology advances so does our skills. Every year more electronics are made and most likely are portable such as @CAPS5, @CAPS6 phones, @CAPS7, and etc. Many of these companies let us take these devices to allow as to do everyday things. With @ORGANIZATION1 creater of the @CAPS8 @CAPS11 can use this internet/music @CAPS9 for everything. for example, I visit my grandparents and I decied to my @CAPS6 phone. I can talk to friends on my @CAPS6 phone by texting and visit my grandparents. More of this opplies to and @CAPS5 @CAPS11 still all go outside and enjoy life. exercise is something @CAPS11 should yet to. If you stay cramed in your house @CAPS12 fun. @CAPS11 need to cheer up and go outside and play sports. @CAPS11 could get included in and join activity. @CAPS11 also can have videos online to show us how to exercise or use yoga. Most of use portables which goes back to my last paragraph. Exercise is big and @CAPS11 all should do it. What I'm trying to say here @CAPS11 can use computers and electronics and exercise with fun one in all. If you understand experts can agree and kids could be healthier and still communicate.",8
1113,"Typing and surfing the web @MONTH1 be exciting; however, is it worth the @CAPS1 risks that there are now? Before computers were discovered, human's healthyness is triple than what it is now. Computers can be useful and @MONTH1 have some benefits; on the other hand, they are harmful and they should not be used as often. They have unprofessional websites, they are not helpful when it comes to excercise, and they disturb @CAPS1 individuals privacy. @CAPS1 kids are let onto computers every day and they wonder @ORGANIZATION1 to the websites that the internet has to offer. Consequently, kids end up in inappropriate websites that they are not meant to be on. In fact, @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 kids enter unproffesional websites and @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 them have no parental vision in the @LOCATION1 alone. Therefore, @CAPS1 kids act up in homes and at school. However kids are not the only ones who are affeted by this. Computers have a disadvantage @ORGANIZATION1 being hacked or virused from uncensored websites. MOreover, computers crash or don't allow use @ORGANIZATION1 computer documents because @ORGANIZATION1 these viruses. Ever since the @ORGANIZATION2 was invented obesity and lack @ORGANIZATION1 exercise in a person's schedule has skyrocketed. A scientist, named @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION1, said,""@CAPS1 computers users have lost their use if muscles, but they have gained to over @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 fat causing a lot @ORGANIZATION1 hem to not be able to do activities they did before."" I believe that this is definitely true because I remember that the same happened to my sister. She ate more and her excercise time was spent more on the computer that on her body. I know that @CAPS1 say that computers help in hand-eye coordination, however, is it really worth more than someones healthy body? @CAPS1 things are sold on the internet that are not in stores, but you don't trust the internet when buying these products. You don't trust the internet because you have heard so much about someone'es identify or money taken away from them.",8
1114,"Have you ever had a computer? I'm sure if you was around my age you know how fun it is to explore the internet. It's a brain tht gives you information about everything. But, it’s not good for you to just drop everything and go to your computer. Things like exercise, socializing and homework matter. If you don't exercise you begin to gain weight, if you don't socialize you'll be an lonely person. Homework is the most important, because it'll help you really well through life. It's fine to go on the computer time to time, but not for hours. Exercising will keep you in shape and if you plan on playing sports, you should jog a couple times of day. Some people make you feel bad if your bigger than they are. For example, I knew someone who was a little big for his age, but people didn't like him and they always made fun of him. I would suggest that you should keep your mind on more important things than a computer. Do you have ant friends? Or did all of them leave you because you wouldn't stop surfinh the web on your computer. As a teenager you should be socializing with your friend at the movies, arcaded and parties. Not in the house on the computer. Especially with your family, because you never know if they're going shopping for you ask me that's selfishness. Every since you got your computer have you been receiving bad grades? Education is the most important thing you need in your life. Without it you can't be or do anthing, because you wouldn't have a degree to get a job. If you don't have a job how can you pay for electrity bill for your computer? Education can get anywhere, if you want it. If not you can be a homeless guy in the street holding a computer that doesn't work. Do you still think this has a positive effect on people? You should talk to parents about getting their child an computer. For example, tell the parent to put a password that only she/he knows, that way he has to ask you to sign onto it everytime we needs it. Blocks off things that you think is important for your child., especially if your child is into sex. That is why I don't think it gives people the right kind effect they might need.",9
1115,"Dear society, @CAPS1't you all have some kind of computer at home? Work? What if we took you computer away? How would you work? These are all esential questions. The computers of our time help us with what we do everyday. First of all they teach hand-eye coordination. Secondly they give us the ability to learn and communicate with the far away places. Lastly, They allow people to communicate quickly by an email or an @CAPS2. If those experts took our computers, @CAPS6 about what would happen. @PERCENT1 of americans have a computer or a cellphone with internet. These people have hane-eye coordination, therefore they use technology alot. People who use computers at work can multi-task. Secondly the modern computer lis a huge necessity. Thirdly, The people who are still in school have to write papers, do reports, but with-out computers. How will they accomplish that? @CAPS6 about what society would be like. Picture it. Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4. These are all websites that have chats where people can communicate. Take it away. See what happens. We only have the telephone what if we @CAPS1't know some ones cellphone number? can't go on a computer that isn't there. Take all of that into consideration. Maybe the computer prevents us from face-to-face communication, but it's a common necessity. We need to be able to ask someone a quick question. Cellphones and calling aren't as quick as on @CAPS2. Do you really want to be the one to take it away? @CAPS6, @CAPS6 about what your to do. Take this letter into consideration. what are you to do? These computers, help with everyday life. From school to work to just fun. Computers help teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about people and far away places. thirdly they allow people to communicate, so go ahead, take it away, but see what happens when you do.",8
1116,"Dear Newspaper I strongly agree with experts on computer's. Those who support advances in technology believe that computer's have a positive effect on people. They say that computers teach us hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn from faraway places and even allow people to talk with others online. Theese effects are true but there are many other bad effects to that they dont like to say. Computers also effect people's visiion as you are really close to the screen, computers are really addicting for many people all around the world and having them do bearly no excercize moving many people to a big problem now n days which is obesity. Computer's also tend to take a lot of time away from people's lives. The way I see it to is that although computer's have some positive effects on people you can change those positive effects in a better way that can keep you fit to and seeing places with your eyes, like you can get practice with hand-eye coordination by simply getting a friend and pass tennis balls back and forth quick so at the same time your exercizing to. Also a computer can have you talk with your friends online but why not talk to them by phone if there far away n go outside and catch some fresh air n if they live close by why not talk to them in person instead. or if you want to learn about a certain far away place why not visit the place instead. There are many things you can do that a computer can do and better. but yet im not saying a computer is all bad at all. I agree that there are both good and bad effects to computers as well as most things in the world we live in. In my opinion to I honestly think there are more bad effects then good effects for computer's.",9
1117,"Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are an extremely usefull tool in this modern age. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to easily learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with other people. Therefore, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Hand-eye coordination is a very important skill for young children to master. Without it they will have sloppy handwriting, absolutely no chance at sports, and much more. Computers help teach them because they need their finger to hit the same key that their eye sees. And because they tend to want to type faster, it will help even more because the finger and eye will have to work in mission to type faster. Computers also give people the ability to easily learn about far away places, people, etc. People used to have to spend hours searching for a half decent book on a topic, and then find the specific information they need in the hundreds of pages. Now that information is only a few clicks away. Say you have had problems with your faucet, it keeps drippy but you dont want to pay for a plumber. You could easily step by step instructions on what to do using the computer, the possibilities are endless. Finnaly, Computers can allow people to stay in contact with friends who @MONTH1 live far away. It is more convinient than using a plane because you dont have to have something in your hands the whole time. You can walk away and then came back when you hear that you got a message. It is also very usefull for people such as buisnesmen because they can talk to multiple people at once while still being able to get other work done, @PERSON1, author of buisnes magazine tells us in an iterview that it is nearly imposible to run a succesfull buisnes without a computer. How people could possibly say that computers have a negative influence on society, I dont know. But I hope that you will publish this in the paper and show them that computers are necesary.",9

1119,"I believe that computers make everyday work easier to do. Computers allow someone from a faraway place to talk to another person who they can’t see in person, they allow you to get work done in a quicker manner. And get a college education without leaving your home. Imagine that you have a relative who lives a great deal of miles away from you and it’s too expensive to call or fly over there. Computers enable us to communicate with them through email or video chat without the hefty price. Because of computers, talking to your faraway family is a few clicks away. Getting work done can sometimes feel like another chore. Computers only make doing your work easier and faster. Would you rather sit and write out a term paper for hours or type it up and email to your in half the amount time college students find that computers get them efficiently than writing by hand. Computers are way to burdens of work. Education is an of all need, but what if the college that you want to attend is too far from home and you can’t afford to move in ? Thankfully, online college courses are available. If it wasn’t for this source of technology, you would be left to do what? Online courses allow an eager student to learn without breaking their bank or leaving their child if they are parents. Without computers, everyone would not be able to get the education that they have a right to. Computers have allowed us to communicate with our family that live somewhere we can’t afford to travel to. These technological devices have enabled to us to get our work done in a timely matter to receive the grade that we deserve. Computers have allowed over @NUM1 citizens to get their education right in their home at a price they can afford.

1120,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that several people are concerned with the technology boom and computer overuse. I can assure you that technocal upgrades only harm our people. Email and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 have only given us a decrease in our already terrible communication skills. Furthermore, we spend less and less time exercising outside because we are trapped in a technology revolution filled with inaccurate information. Why are we hurting ourselves instead of helping? @CAPS2 is very clear that our teens are growing up with no communication skills. I remember reading a persuasive essay and realizing that they used @CAPS3 @CAPS4 based language. @CAPS2 is ridiculous that we are forgetting how to use the proper grammar of the @CAPS7 language. Furthermore, I have also observed that when my friends talk they use slang terms like ""@CAPS8"" and ""@CAPS9"". I understant that computers after a faster and much easier way to communicate but we definetley can't forget the work of @CAPS10 . With the , people who should hope that they don't become a biggest loser contestant say @CAPS2, but, if they continue to mind on their then they will join the millions of obese. Americans I think that when people at their computer they tend to bring junk food with them and for! contrast to this from spending these hours with @ORGANIZATION2 instead of Exercising and let you creative wild would citizen rather pay for a computer or the vast, free, and gorgeous? Furthermore, people are wasting their important attention. A fact that over three of the information in isnt reliable therefore. Also, statistics show that nearly @PERCENT1 of students use to. These statistics also display that when students use these sites they clearly will score lower than a student who did the seemingly ""daunting"" task of looking for the reasearch in a textbook. What is so daunting about @CAPS2? Obviously, nothing is overwhelming. @CAPS2 is only pleasure when the student will get a phenomenal grade and their surronding classmates won't. Furthermore, I ask you why are people flooding their brains with unrealiable information? In conclusion, the effects computers have on people are very negative. Due to this, many people have no communication skills. They are also more likely to become less obese and if that's not enough they are hurting themselves because they are obsessed with inaccurate information. I urge people to dump @PERSON1 and @CAPS11.

1121,"Dear Newspaper I think that computers have a positive effect on people, here are my reasons. You can get in contact with people, if you have a question you can look it up and you can do your job on a computer. I think that these reason will have you positive too. Many people like computers and have one. My first reason is you can get in toch with friends and family. I think this is a good reason because if your grandmother lives in @LOCATION2 you don’t want to drive there every time you want to see her when you live in @LOCATION1. You would use the computer to live chat with her so you wouldent have to drive all the doun there. If you wanted to you could plan a day to go and see her. You would use a computer to get in touch with friends. If you needed to ask them a question about the homework they could answer it. That is my first reason why computers have a positive way on people. My second reason is if you have a computer you can look up questions that you would have. If you needed to know some thing for a big report and none of your friends are up you can look up your computer. Computers can help you so much if you need an answer. If you didet hav a computer if you would be so hard to do stuff. That is why I think that computer can answer your questions. My third reason is you can work on the computer. If your a stay at home mom ya can work on the computer to handle finances. A lot of people work on the computer to save the envirment. When I grow up I’ll probaly work on the computer because it is easer. That is why I think that you can work on the computer. The reason I picked were you can get in tuch with family and friends, you can look up a question that you might have, and you can work on a computer. I hope you have a positive way on computers they help you out. People might think that they not your brain not they don’t help and knoledge you. Many people like and have one. I think that you should have a positive way on computers too.",8
1122,"Dear @CAPS1, The computers that are being used, do have a positive effect on people. For example, there's better communication with friends and family, you get instant news on any topic, and you get advanced education. Imagine if no important business was trying to be in contact with you by cell phone, but you missed the call. No worries the person no contact you by a simple email. Computers are also a positive effect because if you have a facebook, or other interacting werbsites, you know what's going on in your friends life all the time without having the to by reaching them all the to see how they are doing. Every adult watching the news at night before they go to bed to see what has @CAPS2, what if you went to bed early. How would you know what happened?

Using computers too much will have a bad effect on society. Oreos, @LOCATION1, @CAPS6 are all common sparks for people to be eating while on the computer. Now when you're sitting on the computer daily and for hours eating these sparks. You are begging to become overweight. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS7 kids are overweight and that is unhealthy.

The people that love to use the computer definetly have some sort of social network account, @MONTH1 it be @CAPS5, or @CAPS4. Kids think they are immune to getting in trouble while posting messages or putting up picture of themselves. In one case a girl actually killed because of nasty messages posted about her. Three have been other cases in which girls have sent a nude pictures of themselves to their boyfriends and other people soul it. There lives will never be the same because they were using the computer too much. Soon we will become the leader of @LOCATION2 and we will get to the decisions around.

Our world will be run by computers people can learn about places and people that they can never afford to see for real, and lastly, this helps to connect people to other people without talking to them directly.

The fact is the world is turning into a pure run by technology and as we the people get smarter, so does the technology so what good will the future if none of us know how to work a simple peice of technology such as a computer, then how are we going to use the more complicated things then? Believe it or not our world within @NUM1 years will be run all on computers, you will not have to do antyihg but wil them. without computers, how would we know aobut all of the stuff that we know now. How would people know that egypt looked like @NUM2 year ago? they dont to be there they could just look it up on the computer and how just as must about it as if they went there. Also computers enable you to learn about people that lived before your time. What president that you in something aobut how would you be able to find out after computer you could go to a library is right there to be will out computers in todya society. Our average being would in at how does becaus of the that computers have given us. I can whey some experts are conceried that are however, for some people this is the only correction to their emily and friends it there is a family that lives lets say in a different country, and he or she wanted to talk to you, how would you go about doing that? I know that I would try to contact them on the computer. I love friends that live out of state and I enjoy talking to them so if we did not have the compuers that we do. these experts are sasying that we are going to drive across the country to talk to them, if you ask me htat is pretty tire consuming and pointless. In conclusion, I hope that you agree with me in keeping technology in our lives is important because of the future for people to learn nee things about places and people, and also to communicate with friends and family although I can se your part of view that kids are not getting enough exercise most kids that computers are also involved sport.",8
1125,"What is more fun, stairing at a blank computer screen all day, or spending the day out in beutifull nature with your friends and family? Well, if you don't know, I do. I took a survey at my school with the same exact question and @PERCENT2 of the kids said that hanging out with friends and family is much more than spending all of your time on the computer, and there are three reasons why they said that. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, than in person. Next it's unhealthy, and lastly alot of bad things can happen on the internet. So, if you are interested in this topic please keep on reading and I will prove that the computer is not a good way to spend your spair time. Do you know what computers were intended to do? Computers were you people, but have for one second that instead of interacting with people you should interact with the people around you. Instead of going on facebook/myspace to talk to your friends, just them over. If you do that its not only more fun, healthier for you. So next time anything else just think the other options. In my last paragraph didnt I say that hanging out with friends is much more healthier then being? Well I was absolutly @PERCENT1! Did you know that when you waist your only hurting yourself? Well, you are when all your doing is sitting down stairing at a screen you are not doing anything to help your self because you are get absolutly exercise. When your not on the computer at least walking a little bit, but typeing doesnt do anything for you. Thats why people shouldn't spend all of their time on the computer. Have you ever heard of an internet preditor? Well if you let me just sum it up for you. An internet preditor is someone that uses the computer to get people they dont know do inapropriate things. And did I say it was against the law, because it is. So if you you ignore friend because if you dont, bad things. And tahts just one of the reasons why people spend as much time on the computer. So, now you know why people shouldnt spend as much time on the computer as they usually do. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, go in person. Next, it's unhealthy, and lastly, internet preditors. So the next time you open your laptop, just think is it more fun stairing at a blank computer screen or spending the day in beutifall nature with friends and family? And always remember what the is.",8
1126,"I belive having computers in a household is a good idea. They can play games, learn, talk and many more. Here are my three reasons having a computer is a good thing. Having a computer is great to play games! There are so many varieties to choose from. There are card games, board games, even @NUM1 games! You can play solo, but it might be more fun and easyier to bring some friends along for the ride. As you can see having a computer can be fun, but its not the only thing to do on a computer. Useing a computer to learn is wonderful too. The computer can take you to places you have never seen, heard, or been to before, or maybe a place you couldn't afford to go. You @MONTH1 learn that in on place it's sunny all the time and in other places it's not. Another thing the computer can teach you is about animals. Animals have been here way be for us. There is still much we dont know about them. Many scientists have spent their lives studying animal and have put it on the iternet for you to better educate yourself. The computer can also teach you hand-eye. Hand-eye is great to have if your trying out for a sport like football, baseball, and basketball. Also you never know when you'll need to catch somthing. My final reason is also very helpful. Being able to talk on the computer is good to using voice chat or instint messenger is your choice. While talking on the computer you might make some new friends that share the same intrests and hobbies you do. And you can chat with them as long as there online. Also while your talking you can express your ideas and feelings. Somtimes you might just need to blow off some steam. Or maybe post an idea that can one day be famous. As you can see games, learning and talking are easier to do on the computer. This is why I think.",8
1127,"Dear Local Newspaper, I'm writing to you because I believe that people in the @LOCATION1 over use computers these days. I think that instead of home on your lazy and playing farmville and pets on facebook you should get out more. I think that you should @CAPS8 the gym and work out you should @CAPS8 out to the park or have family fun night with your kids (@CAPS1 you have any) The last thing I think you should @CAPS7 is @CAPS8 have a little ""@CAPS2"" time for example take your self somewere nice (you'll about time in a second) @DATE1 all you've done is sit home playing farmville and other games and what not you probably get really fastly and you eating right? well @CAPS1 @CAPS3.... boy you gained some pounds of the @DATE1 and you look you need to get your self to a gym. from sitting on your while on the @CAPS9 every day you any calories or fat @CAPS3 when you eat all your doing is gaining weight. and @CAPS4 you probably don't want to. @CAPS7 you have a family? Well @CAPS1 you @CAPS7 I think that taking a family trip to the park would be fun or going to @ORGANIZATION1 would be a fun way @CAPS3 you can get your hands off those keys and your head with your kids. Also you should make other nightfamily fun night and play games and hang out with family on family fun night you can play characles or a board game. (as long as you don't have a in your house) The last my favorite one is ""@CAPS4"" Time. During ""@CAPS4"" Time you can take your self shopping out to lunch/dinner you even take a map the whole point of ""@CAPS4"" Time is that You @CAPS7 NOT @CAPS8 ON THE @CAPS9!! you need to relax and just take a brake. Well those are my suggestions to you. @CAPS3 now its your turn to jump on out of virtual world and put your head back in reality.",8

1129,"Dear @LOCATION1, I think computers are a great tool for everyone if they use it right. Here are my reasons why. First of all, I think computers are good because news travels quickly. Using the internet, world changing news can spread like wildfire and inform everyone in seconds. It is great for staying in the loop and reading about things you need to know. This reminds me of the time when a massive earth quake hit @LOCATION2 and traumatized its citizens. Within moments of the accidents, it was already circling the internet. This brought mass attention to @LOCATION2 which caused many people to donate and needed items. Secondly, the computer is also good for researching topics for school and common interest. If you need facts for a school project you can easily search what you need through the internet wide variety of search engines, you will be able to pin-point exactly what you are also look up things that interest you. If you have a favorite sports team, band, or are interested in a famous figure, you have tons of information on them at your disposal. You can do all of this within the privacy of your on home so you can remain as secret as a @ORGANIZATION1 agent. This reminds me of the time when are of my idols died. Within seconds of hearing the tragic news I was able to search the topic and get an endless uphoria of information regarding his death. Finally, you can chat with someone from around the world if you wanted to! Using social networking sites like facebook and myspace, you can connect with your friends and chat with them for hours on end. You can also enter chatrooms with people who share a common interest with you. Just like how I talk to people about a band we both love. I believe access to news, research, and staying in touch with your friends is without a doubt the best reasons to use a computer. What are you waiting for? Get one!",9
1130,"Have you ever thought about all the amazing things that computers have done for us? Now, we can learn about anything we want, talk with people on the other side of the world, and even advance in other areas of technology. Computers have, without a doubt, had a positive effect on people. Just imagine this...one second you can be in the blazing deserts of @LOCATION3, the next in a losh, steamy, jungle thriving with animals...All without leaving your room! Using computers, people can learn about new places and things whenever they want. The millions of resources on the internet make it possible to learn about t other places and times. Although this information @MONTH1 be in a local library. Going on the computer is MUCH easier. Who want to go through the trouble of loaning books from the library, when the internet is there for your use any time? No registration to get a library card. No late fees and no waiting lists. It is quite clear that using your computer to do research is a very valuable thing. @NUM1 out of ten people said that they would rather email a person than talk on the phone with them. Now, with computers, people can instant message, or email anyone, anywhere in the world. Making a call from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 can be very expensive but with email, I can talk to my @CAPS1 friend, @PERSON1, free of charge. I remember when she moved to @LOCATION2. It was sad, but we promised to stay in touch. With e-mail and instant messaging, it was easy to talk, and exchange the latest news! Having the ability to communicate with soemone easily is an unbeliveable privalige, that would be none existant without computers to help us. Lastly, computers have helped people make advances in othe areas of technology. Where would we be in science and medicine without computers? These machines have helped scientists to do experiments. With a simulated expiriment they can be positive that no other variables will affect your results. Now, experiments can be extremely acurate. Computers have helped advance medicine as well. They have been the key to unlocking all sorts of cures for dangerous diseases. Who knows, maybe in @NUM2 years therew ill be a cure for cancer. All of these amazing accomplishments have been positivly effected by computers. ALthough some people @MONTH1 think that computers have a negative impact on our day-to-day life, I @PERCENT1 disagree. People have learning, talking, and advances in technology with one click of a mouse. Computers have effected people positivley in many ways, so, click away! Computers have none of that.",11
1131,"Dear local newspaper writer, I'm writting to talk to you about the use of computers. I think computers benifit our comunties a lot. I feel this way because it can warn us about a natural disaster. It teaches us about everything & everything. Last we get to talk to people online In these next paragraphs ill share my thoughts about this topic to you. My first reason is natural disasters. Computers always warn us about them. For example when hurricane katrina hit computers were able to see that on their. Many people was able to flee the city before that happened. States shows @PERCENT1 of the natural disasters computer classified them. Computers saves people live eaach & every. Another example is with the earthquakes that recently happened in @LOCATION1. Computers informed many people about them. Those were my reasons how computers warn us about natural disasters. My second reason why I say computers benifit us is because it teaches us about everything & anything we learn about faraway places, new word & things that is happening in our own country. For example I had to research a person my project & all I dis was type in his name & pages full of information popped. You will be amazal how much information the computer has. Comuter has everything you need on as person & so much more. this is my second reason why computers are helpful. My last reason we get to talk online. Now the has its pros & cons. Talking online is very fun. I mean you in many website, myspace, facebook, twitter. Its never ending. People can talk to old friends, family anybody really. But many people have to be careful cause their creeps out ther. Like say you can't meet up with you friend you can @ORGANIZATION1 or ooVoo (webcame) them. The computer is you friend. So you might as well make good use with it. This is my last reason now the computer can benifit you. In conclusion I think the computer makes the world that much easier. My reason why you ask. It warns us about, natural disaster. It teaches us everything & anything. Last up can talk online.",9
1132,"Dear @CAPS1 in @CAPS2, Computers are one of the world's best discoveries today. For one, they help in our educational processes. They also help connect people from all over the world in little time and are a neccesity in science research. Overall, computers are the best thing that has ever happened to mankind. First and foremost our children today are already struggling in their educational systems. But with new computers they strive to meet every goal. Teachers cannot tell them everything but computers can, underneath that hard drive is a wealth of knowledge awaiting to be saked up by eager minds. Also, in todays world, waiting is almost non-existant. Learning to type gives these children better opportunities for success in later life. Family, say your child is out @NUM1 school day. Normally, they would miss their homework. But now, they can check it online and get back to their crucial studies when they are feeling better unless you want to risk tommorow's future workforce, computers are in essential tool for us, and our children. One of the best things a lot this world is that we're all different, connecting with each other helps us learn how to tell with each other and move forward as a society. Conneticing through the internet through programs like @ORGANIZATION1 is important for buissnesses as it helps them make decisions faster will ultimatly effect us. But don't be fooled. It can also befor pleasure, say @CAPS3'son & buissness trip in @LOCATION1. No problem. Just go on webcam with him and you don't have to miss him anymore. In the government, problems evolve quickly, and steathily. To solve this, a president can quickly connect to his/her advisors while still being in his/her office. Connecting people through computers is maraculous, and important to life as we know it. In addition, we wouldn't be were we are in science if it wasn't for computers. First of all, we are making great strides with cancer research to day, than estatic common computer. If it wasn't for that, we might not even have kemotherapy. Lets face it, computers are faster then us; way faster. But this is a god thing, because faster proccesing means faster research. While a simple machine @MONTH1 not tell us the cure through its proccesing speed. It certainly brings us a lot closer to unraveling the mysteries certain diseases shold beneath. Two minds are better than one. Even a scientist can not know everything. But while connecting through a computer to scientists all over the world, they can analize research, and make very informed, responsible decisions. Certainly that will extend our life exsentency, and who doesn't want you've larger's some people say that people are too glued to their computer screens. But bear in mind, these are the people helping you stay alive, and helping lower your heathcare bill yoour talking about. So when you get ill and they find a cure, why don't you still compain that they only found it because they were attached to their keyboards and monitors! Trust them, they know what they are doing. So can we come to an agreement life? Computers only do good things, like enhance our youth's advention, connect our and help us find cures for the most malignant diseases and illnesses in the world. So help the world help you, and go promote the use of computers across your community. It will only further advance us as a society in the end.",10
1133,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are used everyday by millions of people. I believe that the technology of computers have a positive effect on people. I think computers have a positive effect on people because people use them for research. People use computers to communicate with people far away. Computers are even used as a news resource. In my opinion, computers make things easier. Computers have a positive effect on people because they are very helpful. You can use computers to research different things. @CAPS1 you have a computer, you can learn new things about places you never knew existed. For example, @CAPS1 you have a homework assignment, you don't have to use a book to get information, you can just use your computer. So, for those reasons, I think computers have a positive effect on people. Computers are always being used for several things. However I think people used computers the most for communication. On a computer you can communicate with friends and family members that live in other states. Instead of sending letters to people by mail, now a days people use e-mails and instant message. You can talk to people faster this way and it's much easier. Computers have a positive effect on people. It's makes some things in life much easier. I don't understand why they would have a negative effect on people. It's the year @DATE1, and computers are used for basically everything. Remember how we used to have to read the newspaper to find out about breaking news and important things? Well, since we have computers a lot of people don't read newspaper. On the computer you can read the whole newspaper, and even find out more about things that happen in our world. So what's the point of even reading the newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer? I believe computers have a positive effect on people's life because you can do anything on the computer. You can research information, commmunicate with people, and use it as news resource. Doesn't that make lif a lot easier? So why do some people think computers have a negative effect on people?",8
1134,"Dear @PERSON1, Experts are concerned about the use of computers. They say that they spend hours on the computer and less time exercising enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I agree. While people use the computers, they don’t interact and meet new friends in person. They stay inside and don't get excersise, and kids might talk with strangers. When we use computers we chat with friends online and don't really interact with others. We meet new friends and chat online and never meet them and socialize, so that is one disadvantage of a computer. Another problem is lack of exercise. While we are on the computer we spend a lot of time and sometimes causes us to even forget to exercise. Then we slowly begin to get unhealthy. Another major problem of computers is talking or chatting with strangers. Some might meet some random people online and give them personal info. Kids might even meet with some of the strangers they talked to online and get hurt! well thank you for reading my opinions about computers. I hope you take them into consideration. Kids and even adults dont interact with freinds, lack exercise, and give personal information to strangers.",6
1135,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do people benefit from the use of computers. Some say that using computers rather than exercising and being outside is a bad thing. I personally believe that the use of computer technology is a good thing. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, help people learn, and allow people to communicate with others. The use of computers teach hand-eye cordination and reaction time. Some say that being outside and exercising is better than using a computer but many computer games help hand-eye cordination. Alter playing computer games more and more the time it takes for you to react to the game you are playing and hit the mouse button is very important. These skills could help you in the activities you take part in and every - day life, personally, I play a lot of @CAPS3 @NUM1, a computer gaming system. @CAPS3 has helped ny hand-eye cordination greatly and it has shown in the four sports that I play. Clearly, Computers can be very helpful and can help your hand - eye cordination. Computers can also help people learn in many ways. There is a lot of content on the internet that simply can't be in school. The ability to learn about foreign countries is a big part in learning as a student. I use the internet nearily every night to type my papers and find the information that I need. It has helped one as a student. Also, typing papers on computers is becoming the new @CAPS4 of hand writting. Teachers are beginning to require that school work is typed on a computer and printed. Documents can be saved do that they cannot be lost inlike a hard copy written by hand. Although many believe that using a computer is a waste of time, it can also help you stay organized. Many people have calenders in their computers that send you reminders on your schedule. Your computer is also where your data like music and pictures can be saved. Computers are also very useful for learning and organizational purposes. We can communicate with others using computers. People use computer technology to communicate everyday through @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and I-chat. If I need to know what our homework is or when practic is I use my computer to ask someone for the answer. Before I began communicating with my computer talking to others was much harder to do. Although many disagree with using computer technology, computers are often the way we communicate with foreign countries. When something happens overseas the first way we found out about it is a computer. It is essential for us to use computers to communicate with other nations. Clearly computers are importan for communication purposes, we must continue to use computers for multiple reasons. Although many disagree with the use of computers, there hand - eye, communications, and learning purposes are very important. Without computer technology we would function much differently. It is up to you to continue using computers. ",10
1136,"Dear Local Newspaper, I don't know if I am understanding correctly but are you honestly thinking about not advancing technology? Quickly rethink that because that @MONTH1 just be the worst mistake you could ever make computers can tech hand-ey coordination, they can also give you very useful knowledge. Lastly, computers help us stay close to our family and friends. Fisrt off, about @PERCENT1 of people say that they use the computer every day so that they can increase their knowledge. This could ba as simple as going on @ORGANIZATION1! and discovering the latest news. This is ten times easier that going on the @CAPS1 and waiting for the news stone you want details on. I took a survey and @NUM1 students say that they use thier computer every night so that they can read more into thier social studies or science unit, @CAPS2 computer advances away is like @CAPS2 learning advances away, now is that what you want? Second, @PERSON1, chrildrens doctor states, ""Computers give children that hand-eye coordination they need to enhance in sports"" I agree! Sports such as baseball, soccser, and basketball all need a great deal of hand-eye coordination. Without the hand-eye coordination, students will not do well and end up quiting. I know that if I was having trouble with sports for a long time, I would give up! If the teens gave up sports then they would't have anyining to keep them fit one! that would lead to hundred of kids with on obesity problem. Lastly, @CAPS2 away the advancing in computers maens that you are @CAPS2 away family and friends connectionds. Computers offer many sites such as facebook or myspace o connect with loved ones. You can also go on @CAPS3 or sype to chat or video chat with them. Yes, maybe computers are @CAPS2 away time with family but what about @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 in @LOCATION1 that you have at to in over a year? Don't you want some time them too? You can make time limts for yourself so that you don't spend your whole time on the computer. This way you can took to all of your loved ones would you want to be the one crushing the oceans of a child that wants to talk/ see his grandparents? In conclusion, I remember talking and laughing with my friends over the computer when @CAPS6 sick so that @CAPS7 could cheer me up. Dont take that away from me! Keep enhancing computers so that I can advance my knowledge, increase my hand-eye coordination and get to see my far friends and family.",9

Also you can talk with friends and family on computers. We have been told that some people think were spending too much time on the computer. Yes, but we need these machines to survive. News @CAPS1 took a pull and said ""more than half of @LOCATION1 schools are now using computers to put homework on to save paper"". @CAPS3 we start useing computers to do things that we ushelly use paper for we would be saving millions of trees. For example you can send an email insted of snail mail, the mail would go faster and save paper! People who care about the earth make websites on the computer to inform people how to @CAPS2 just to see each otherthey could mail and talk all they want. Also @CAPS3 you like to use cellphone alot the waves kill apoximately @NUM1 bees a year. @CAPS3 you chatted with your freinds it would save bees lives.

I'v went out the is another place you can check' to get the weather and keep your family safe. @CAPS3 there was a hurricane and the power like birthdays and weddings your computer has a calendar on it that tells you wherever you write something on it. @ORGANIZATION1 citizens spend over @MONEY1 a year on phone bills. You can talk to freinds and family on the computer and save thousands. When parents don't have phones they rely on computers to comunicate with people.

Its now or never citizens of newtown! You know computers, help the earth there a fast way to spend information, and they let you talk and see your freinds online. So get up and write our local news paper telling them why computers benefit our society.",9
1138,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The use of computer benefits society due to the possitive affect on people. Such as good hand-eye coordination, ability to learn about far away places and people as well as being able to talk online with family and friends. Did you know that teenagers who use computers often when compared to those who don't, have increased test scores? This is because they are able to look so definitions faster, research and learn about anything they need at their fingertips. Furthermore, families and friends that live across the country are able to keep in touch due to email, video chats and facebook. It is fascinating to realize that use of the computer can increase your hand eye coordination. You are probably wandering how this is and think that I am insane but there are legitimate reasons. Since I play basketball, volleyball and softball, hand eye coordination is extremely important. One cold, wintery @DATE1 @TIME1. I was working on a long history paper and @CAPS1 essay, which meant countless hours on the computer typing. At five o'clock off I went to my basketball grow, @CAPS2 the best game of my life was playerl. Then, a week later, we had another game but this time I went straight from church. Consequently, I did not play as well; missed a lot of passes and shots. This proved to me that things use of computers, my hand-eye coordination improved. Can you imagine being able to learn about people in faraway places, their cultures, ethicities and relgion? Well now this is more than possible through the advances in technology. In history, we were doing research on the world hunger crisis in our allied countries. Through the knowledge of this hunger, I was able to start a fundraiser at my church. @PERSON1; @CAPS2 teenagers like myself do not eat for @NUM1 hours. Research has proven that @NUM2 children in countries of africa die a day from malnurutousment. Now that this has been brought to my attention, I am going to work four hours a day to give these innocent children even a portion of what I consume. Thus through the use of computers I was able to learn about the pain those children suffer and now it's my . Do you have family that's across the country that you are rarely able to see? My aunt and uncle live in @LOCATION3 and they were just blessed with a beautiful baby boy, @LOCATION4. Since we are only graced with their presenced about once a year we begin to miss them. But now through skype, email and facebook, we are able to stay updated on the success and growth of @LOCATION4 as well as @CAPS2 they have recently traveled to. Also @PERCENT1 as the teenage population in the @CAPS3.S spend at least four hours a day @CAPS4, tweeting or using facebook to stay in touch with their friends. Recently, I have moved from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 and staying in contact with my fr iends there is extremely important to me. Those are the people that I grew up with and have known since birth. The use of computers has allowed me to stay in contact with distant friends and relatives. To conclude, due to improved hand-eye coordination, ability to learn about far away places and people as well as being able to communicate online, with other people the use of computers benefits society. Through the internet, people can learn about @LOCATION2 places to travel bike and exercise while enjoying nature. Furthermore, when family and friends want to spend time together, they need to plan the logistics of it and without email and being online this becomes nearly impossible. I appreciate you taking the time to read this and hopefully you will take my opinion into consideration when debating over the topic of computer.",11
1139,"To the local Newspaper, I think using computers does not have a negative effect on people. I believe it's an advantage to use it. You are given technology, advantage so why not use it? They give people chance to chat with people allow them to make friends. These days people even watch to shows on the computer-websites such as: @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1 allows them to search anything and watch it on @CAPS1. People make emails, download music and several other things. Children at the age of @NUM1, @NUM2 even @NUM3 move use computers-play games on them. i have a cousin who is @NUM3 and he plays games on it all the time he even knows how to search something on the computer. Some people @MONTH1 think it gives you a negative effect, but really it doesn't. Those people think that should comee to the reality. We have to step up as the life goes. Let's say a girl doesn't have a computer, her parents think that computers spoil children, their technology spoil children. The girl goes to school, her friends asks her to give them her e-mail. Every time her friends asks her about email she makes up some excuse and tries to avoid the subject. this time she made an excuse, but how many times is she going to make up an excuse. Then suppose one day her friends finds out she doesn't have a computer and embarasses her in front of everyone. So, what I'm trying to say is that you have to see around you and go on with it computer also saves your time. You can just type instead of writing whole out. You can make your writing cursive or any other that you would like. After reeding my letter, I hope you understand my point. Next time you see a person who thinks computers give negative effects to people, tell the advantages of the computers and how it benefits society around you.",8
1140,"Dear Newspaper, People always believe that technology today such as computers are making more and more people lazy and not going out into the real world such as people who don't spend time with family, become very unfit, and also @CAPS1 websites and people you talk to can put you in harms way and you can get hurt. First, who wouldn't want to spend time with family and find out things that happend to them, @CAPS1 people because they are to busy being on the computer instead of going camping with the family, going to an amusement park and also some family gatherings. People who thinks that the computers is a helping thing to use but @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS1 people learn much easier from family of friends then from a computer.

When you are on and someone and live where you live they can be lieing and you could take them seriously and meet up with them and that is how you can get killed or go missing. Also, the computer allows you to put pictures and videos online and a lot of teens and adults are posting up on the internet very inapropriate pictures of these bodies and people should't be seeing that. I hope that if you or a family is always on the computer you should say you need to spend time with your family, you can become very unfit, and you can be at risk of getting hurt by people you don't know.",8
1141,"Some ""experts"" are warned that people should spend too much time on their computers. Yet, look at all of the advantages to a computer. You can develop better hand-eye coordination skills, internet with friends/family who could live hundreds of miles away, and you can learn about cultures all around the world, along with the people who live in those countries, without ever leaving home. In my oponion, computers overall benefit society, helping us learn more & more every day. First off, there are many skills you can develop on the computer. For example, when playing interactive high-paced games, kids get a sense of awareness timing, and hand-eye coordination. Not to mention, with new advances in technology, people can now go to college without ever leaving home, and at a much lower price, while still getting a great education. Many people even work from home, thanks to their computers. These are still only a few of the many skills that can be learned on computers. Secondly, why buy a ticket to a far away country that's fairly expensive, trade in all your money for the money they have there, go through the hasslels of baggage, ect. When you could simply go online and look it up on the computer? You can go online, look up some of that countries recipes, language, pictures, people without the hassel of going there. Not to mention, for kids who aren't old enough to @LOCATION1, or have to do a report on it, instead of making through countless textbooks, newspapers, libraries in general, they go online, @CAPS1 their country, and they have must, if not all the info they need right there. So not only is getting the information then you would've learned in the first place, thereby, extending your knowledge. Finally, the internet helps people connect. Leading experts from the @CAPS2.S.A., or Family security agency, says that since people have started using programs like @ORGANIZATION1 and facebook, many more families, who live in different countries, have been able to re-coonect and get to know one-another. For example, if you have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1, you could both buy cameras for your computer, install them, and within minutes, be seeing each other/talking face to face. I think this is better then simply writing letters to them, as it's quicker, and you get to connect more. Same goes if a friend or you move away, but want to stay in touch. A quick facebook account or @ORGANIZATION1, and you'll still be good friends. So all in all, yes, computers do benefit society, as they help teach people skills, learn about distant cultures/far away countries, and connect people, who might live in different countries. I don't see anything wrong with these beneficial factors to society. So yes, computers have a positive effect on people.",10
1142,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have a positive impact on people. Although people aren't outside being active, computers still benefit in a good way. Computers teach hand-eye coordination they're convient and you can interact online with diffrent types of people. Surely, computers teach hand-eye coordination. There are many website on the internet that teach kids to type. Typing helps kids learn the alphabet, learn what the letters look like and shows them where the keys are. Also, there are other sites where the computer interacts with you. Last, there are many kids even adults who have disiexing and get their letters jumbled, but there are softwares where when you type it will say what letter you have typed. Therefore computer teach hand-eye coordination. Have you ever been one of those students who write their papers, but get bad grades because their handwriting was messy? Using a computer is more convient and will make your due assignment as neat as ever. First, computer are convient because you have the answer to any question just at the click of button. Next, theres no need to spend money and go buy a book to look up research just research online for free. Finally, it is convinient for teachers and your employees, because if you need to send in a paper do it via-email. Getting a paper by email is much easier than getting it in pen with samples. Computer are convient in many ways. Computers allow people @NUM1 video chat and talk online. First, there are many families who have at least one member who lives in a different place. Computer allow families to see each other online. Without ever leaving their state. Next, there are other families who have a mom, dad, husband or wife in the army and haven't seen each other in person in years, but see each other on line. Lastly, there are many students and teachers who teach and learn online. This is easy for most people who have busy lives. Therefore you can interact online. As you can see computers have a positive effect. They teach hand eye coordination. They supply online chat, and are very convient. So next time you go to the library to research a book, stay at home do the same online.",10
1143,"Dear @CAPS1 people, Your have been told that using a @CAPS1 can give no knolege, but I agree that it gives you hand-eye cordanation, A @CAPS1 is the most helpful thing in the world. For my first reason, computers have so many technology things inside that help people everyday. I want to talk about interacting with family and friends. You can go on facebook, myspace and even twitter to talk to your friends. Its the most common thing to go on the @CAPS1. About @PERCENT1 teens and adults use myspace and facebook. Litter kids would be like @PERCENT2 use @CAPS2 to interact with some friends. This technology is the most best thing you could ever use. The second reason is, that people need to learn how to use a @CAPS1 and the hand-eye cordination. For learning, you could learn how to type, write stories, using @ORGANIZATION1 word, and even learning whats to use on the internet, for hand-eye cordination, you can learn all the keys an the keyboard and what they do to get better skills. My thirdly reason is, how to search on google or the @LOCATION1. Google is the most common thing that everyone uses. To look up pictures for projects, labs basiclly for anything. And for the dictionary, you can see what words mean and the dictionay is for learning and doing homework. For my conclusion all these reasons are true and computers are the greatest sources on the planet, everyone do you want education or not? computers help everyone. You gotta love it!?!",8
1144,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 know a lot of people now a days are constintly on the computer, and many people think it’s a problem. Well you should know the computer is helpful in many ways, such @CAPS1 learning, entertainment, and even weight. That is just a few out of the hundreds of different things there is to do. The computer can help you get in contact with realitives you haven't seen in a long time. Or maybe if you have been having some health problems you can go online to see what is wrong, I remember my mom has been getting really dizzy and sick, and her doctor told her everything was fine, but in wasen't. So my mom checked up what was wrong on the computer and found out she had a disease, and when she went back to the doctors they figured out she really did and her on a medicine. In my opinion the computer was on of the best inventions made. It can be used for so many things, you can also purchase items over the computer. So now I hope you agree with my opinion and support the use of computer's.",6
1145,"Dear Local Newspaper On the subject of computers; Their pros and cons, I would have to say that both sides provide veru important reasons why you should and shouldn't use computers, I think that computers are very important to many students just like me. First of all computers help me and my fellow classmates with many asisgnmenrs. Some of us simply don't have the time to go to a library and look for a book that might nit even posses the information needed. On the internet you can find the same amount of valuable information or more! It also helps to develop your hand-eye coordination some peopel say ""you can learn hand-eye coordiantion outside too? Although that is true, typing is very fats and neat. As you can see my hand wriitng is not the best but I type very fast and make little mistakes so I do not need the neatest hand writing ever.The way I see it computers are the fastert way of doing alot of things. So if you spend time writign neatly you might nit even be able to go outside and see nature. my dad is a environmentalist and he uses computers. Sometime the easy way isn;'t always the best way thats why we must have balance. Do not infrom people to stop using computers but to balance thier time with them. Everything is good if it's balanced. for example, coffiene, In large amounts it is rather unhealthy but when you need a small you turn to caffiene and it helpd, same with computers. Besides, computers are now made everwhere, trying to get rid of them is simply unreasonable. We are already in a recession we dont need more trouble. I prefer to talk with my friends eye to eye however if you cannot do that a computer is a perfect alternative. So you see comuters are evry helpful to some balance is the answer!",7
1146,"Computers are becoming a household item in the @LOCATION1 and around the world. There is a problem through, because some people believe that computers don't benefit society. In my opinion, computers are a @CAPS9 thing for our everyday lives. The internet allows us to communicate with friends, family, and more people around the globe! Its various programs help keep files and other things of that nature organized and updated. Finally, computers are a @CAPS9 resource when researching for projects, reports, homework, or anything else that requires information to complete. The world is a large place with many people, places, regions, and countries. Families sometimes move far away from their families and friends, so they want to keep in contact. Post is a very slow and costly service, while the internet is cheaper and quicker! IM's, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, use one of these fast and cheap ways. They allow you to send a message and receive a message on any day, at anytime, in any place with little of no hassle involved. Another way is to use websites like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, which allow you to update your ""status"" on your wall so everyone on your friends list can see or comment on. The final and last way is by using a webcam, which enables you to see the person on the other end of the ""call"" and you can also hear their voices. This is the best way, in my opinion, because instead of sending text and pictures they can explain everything in their own way with no limit on how much they can say. Many people have noticed that the world is not an organized place. Computers help organize it with their many applications and programs like @ORGANIZATION1 apps, @CAPS5, and document folders. @ORGANIZATION1 is a chain of apps for everything from writing documents to making spreadsheets to making presentations and even to making fliers for special events. These apps are the basic to starting up a business or promoting an invention. @CAPS5 mainly centers on keeping information stored an organized in files however you wish and is @CAPS9 for quick access to them. My parents and other adults I know always say ""organization is the key to success"", so @CAPS5 definetly helps. The final and most basic way that computers help for organization are document folders. These little things come in handy when you need to save something quickly bu want to keep it organized. All you have to do is name it, click save, and bada bing bada boom you're done! Most importantly, computers come in handy when researching for projects or something else that requires lots of up-to-date information. Books will take a few days and you only have @NUM1 days to research, create, and organize your project and data. What are you gonna do now? You could hand it in late, but then you'll yet in trouble. Here is where the fast and reliable internet comes in if you need to know the difference between @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, use the search engine @ORGANIZATION2. If you have a question about the @CAPS7 @CAPS8, use @LOCATION2. Anything at all that you @MONTH1 need is at the tips of your fingers, with a little help from your computer and internet of course. In conclusion, I would like to state that computers aren't a good thing for society, they are a @CAPS9 thing for civilization! From communicating with friends and family around the world to organizing our everyday lives and helping us research important topics, the internet and computers are a @CAPS9 way to help out our lives in my opinion. Wouldn't you agree with me?",10
1147,"Dear @LOCATION1 harold, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits socity. Those who support advancences in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. But computers can be a bad thing. They can deprive children from excersizing, enjoying nature and spending time with family and friends. First of all, Computers can stop children from exersizing. ""@CAPS1 I can never get outside after school, because I'm checking my email."" @CAPS2 high school student. A recent studdy shows @PERCENT1 of students at a middle school @CAPS3 when they come home they go right on to the computer. This shows that almost half of the students at just the middle school are on the computer. This is way computers can be a bad thing. Secondly, some children spend more time in the grate indoors than the outdoors. ""I spend most of my time breathing in airconditioning (or heat) than fresh air."" @CAPS2 middle school student. Imagine, a child is staring at a computer screen playing a game or on facebook mean wile it's a beautiful day in the middle of @DATE1. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students @CAPS3 that they spend more time indoors than out. Computers can be a bad thing in a childs. Finally, computers can interfere with a childs time spending with family or friends. ""I @CAPS1 spend an entire evening at a family party on these computer."" @CAPS3 elementary student. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 homes have a computer and it is beang used @NUM5 by children. This shows that little @PERSON1 of the @PERSON2' house hold is never out side playing with friends. Computers can do more harm then good in a house hold. It can stop children from exercising enjoying the out doors and spending time with family. I ask you to tell your children or grand children necies nephues to cut down on computer time.",9
1148,"Dear newspapers, I think that computers have a possitive effect on people because you could chat online. There are electronics out for children that they can plug up to there computer and learn different stuff. And you can pay your bills on the computer. People that have no phone od don't want to leave the house at that moment and have a computer can go on chat rooms or a local website can chat to friends and family. Also many people that have websites like facebook, myspace etc... can find new people and have so many things in common. And some people do find that @CAPS1 person that they been looking for. I think that they jusy come out with a new electronic for little kids like leaf frog that they can plug up to a computer/laptop and they can learn there alaphabet, counting numbers, and even spelling, This is a good product for little kids so they cam use the extra work over, the @DATE1 or after school so they can stay smart and learn in school and out of school. One day I had my mother what she was doing and the light bill so i was like how can you and she said and a website bt I forgot what's it called and you could pay your bills right there. So instead of up going in your are go to a local show when thay pay bills and can like or if you get a computer you can do that in you home with no . So people who publish the newspaper I think and I hope you think to this is a good response that tells you good things about a computer. And I hope it sticks around for a long time.",8
1149,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever wanted to see the whole world with just a click of a button. That is as simple as just going out and purchasing a computer. Computers are becoming more and more popular. Some people think that people use computers too much. I am here to say that, that is a terrible accusation. First, computers help you with school work. Let's say you have an essay and it needs to be @NUM1 words or more you can just use word cant, then you have the exact amount of words. Also you might need to look up some information about a certain topic. You can just simply type in the word and search and then you have millions of choices to choose from. If you had a homework assignment that you didn't understand you could look up how to do it on the internet. But this i just the begining. Another reason computers are so great is that you can meet and interact with people all over the world and learn their culture. You can enter a free chatroom and meet someone from @LOCATION1. You would also be learning about their culture. This could also be a way to learn another language. If the person spoke fluently in @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 than he or she could teach you. You might be able to see how an @CAPS2 household runs. You could then make comparisons between the way you both live your life. Finally, you can understand the world around you. There are many websites where you can get a live sattelite feed on places on every corner of the globe. You could also do reasearch on the planet itself. You can learn about the care of the earth and what goes on inside it. You might also learn about nature. You could understand more about plants and animals. You can also got a look into space. You can learn about planets, if there is life on planets or water or anything else these would be things you can reasearch. So to sum it all up, you can get school work done. You can interact with people all over the world. You can also learn about the world around you and that covers less than a fraction of everything you can do on the computers, but don't stay on all day. Make sure you go outside and have a great time too!",8
1150,"Dear Newspaper, Some people are asking others about the effects computers have on other people. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. But my opinion is that the comuter is great and it does not keep people away from other activitys. First, the computer does not keep people away from other activitys because, there are @NUM1 hours in a day, and it's that persons folt if they don't get off the computer, and go do other activitys. Even though the computer has lots of things, and it is very interesting. people. Should still have the common since to get off nad go do other things, so I think it's there fult if they don't get off the computer. Also there are a lot of reasns that people don't get out and do other activitys, so why just stop computers. Secondly, the computer does not keep people away from other activitys, because there are lots of destration that keep people away from other activitys, so why blame computers. For example the television keeps people from doing other activitys, but their not talking about stop that. Also the computer teaches you about a lot of thngs, an can so you a lot of things that you don't know about and is trying to find out. For example your family's history, you could go look that up on the computer. Lastly, the computer does not keep people away from other activitys, because if people were really worried about there other activitys then they would get off the computer and go do what they had to do. For example if they had to go to the gym then they should get off the computer, and go to the gym because the computer does not make you fat, you make yourself fat, so the should be resonable enough to go to the gym, and not be on the computer all day. Also if you were going to spend time with your family the how could the computer stop you from doing that, you should already know what you need to do and I don't think the computer would make you forget things like that. So it would be the person's fult if they forget not the computers. To rap this up, computers does not keep people away from other activitys, because it's there responablity to remeber what they need to do not the computers and there are lots more destrations then computers, but it's still not computer's falty it your's.",8
1151,"Dear local newspaper, I think people are spending to much time on the compture an these are my reasons, Less time exercising, an enjoying nature and interacting with friends an family. My reason is less time exercising people are to busy on the computer playing games an talking to other ones. Dont you think you should be outside doing some exercising like running around or playing sports instead of being in your house on the comptuer doing nothing. People should at lest get @NUM1 of exercising. You could be on the comptuer for a little while but not on it @NUM2. Take a break from the comptuer an go outside for a little bit injoy the weather an being outside. People just cant take @NUM1 away from there comptuer time I find that really hard to belive that people cant. Its like the comptuer took over there brains an all they want to do is be on it an never get off. My second reason is enjoying the nature go outside for a little bit an see whats going on there go take a walk outside in the woods an look for the animals or look for animal tracks. There are a lot of fun things you can do outside like climb a tree or going fruit picking. You dont have to be inside all day an stare at the computer playing games an talking to friends. You could be outside injoying the nice weather you are getting. Peopl need to learn that there is better things to do with there time. My third reason is that interacting with friends an family. It inportant you spend time with them an see how they been an what they been up to. But instead people are always to busy to talk to there family members becuse they are always on the comptuer doing stuff they dont need to being doing. There are a lot more inportant things in life an people need to understand that. Family is way more inportant then being on the computer but people these days they put family second because they never want to talk to them or see them because they are always so busy waisting there time on the comptuer. Like checking there email is fine but waisting your time on these chat things like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 its just a waist of your time people can hang out an do things they dont have to be on the computer asking there friends that they should just call them an ask. Dont get me wrong I have a @CAPS2 to an it takes away from your hanging with family an things but I make time for I can hang out with friends an family an enjoy the natuer an I do exercis. So I dont see why its so hard for people to do that. So in conclusion I think that people do waist there time on the comptuer to much like I said there are more inportants things in life an things you can be doing like exercising, Enjoying natuer an hanging with friends an family. So I hope you take my ideas an consider them an thank you for listening to what I think. I hope people can get it through there head that they dont have to be on the comptuer @NUM4.",8

1153,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing a letter to you today because I have herd a complaint that and more people are using computers and getting less exsercise. These experts that are concerned also say people need to enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends more. These experts @MONTH1 be smart but they are wrong. I am going to tell you how they are wrong. My first example is that people that go on the computer alot still exercise. Take twitter as a example. The football player ocho-cinco ""tweets"" all the time but that doesn't mean he doesn't get exercise. There are plenty of sports players that are on twitter and they are fit. Most of the kids in my grade including me have a facebook. Most of the kids are fit. Just because they are on the computer alot doesn't mean they can't exercise. My second example is the effect of the computer. Students use the computer for a lot of things. We use wikipedia for are projects and research a person. Some schools know a day almost depend on computers. I rember when I lived in country we never had to reely type anything unless it was a project. When I moved to @CAPS3 I am always typing something. Even a rough draft they want me to type. In couentry I would write out my final draft. I have to use the computer. Schools also are teaching us about the computer @CAPS4 as we learn more and more things on the computer we are on the computer more and more. When someone. Finds out a new website there going to tell there friends and there going to pass it on and @CAPS4 on. My third example is how the experts say that people are spending to much time on the computer and less time interacting with family and friends. My grandpa, aunt, other family members have a facebook account. That means I can still interact with family and friends. The people that are the computer alot that are adults probably don't have family over every night and probably go out with friends evey once in a while. Computers also benefit Society for buisness people they might have to a powerpoint and they have a computer. When experts say we need to enjoy nature, interact with family and friends, and do more excising they might be right but we can do all these things but we can also still go on the computers. If you take a survey in @CAPS3 to see how many people are on the computer almost everyday and then you ask them how many of them exercise you would see that you can do both.",8
1154,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 a computer isn't harmful in any way. It helps people learn about things they didn't know. Also it lets people interact with people around the world. Another is that it lets people stay in touch with family and friends around the globe. Computers don't harm, they help. Computers are a learning tool. Schools like mine have over a hundred computers but they are only used for education. Anyway even if we try to go on different sites we get redirected to a blocked website. Cars and other machines were built by computers which supplied the blueprints. There is one thing computers are mostly used for, and thats to learn. Are you thinking about going on vacation somewhere but don't know how things work around there? Well a computer can help you with those promblems. It lets you see how people are and what the place looks like with a virtual tour. Even with some assistance if you don't know about traditions or beliefs. Computers are a great way to explore. Computers are a great way to communicate with others. Family members that live on the otherside of the world can use computers to talk and see how your doing. How about old friends that moved away. You can still talk and communicate with each other. Getting in touch with friends and family isn't all that bad is it? And these are reason to show how computers aren't harmful in anyway. It gives people a good education. It lets people learn about cultures of places around the world. And talking to friends is something thats good, not bad. This is why computers don't harm people, they help.",8

1156,"Dear newstimes, I really think that computers are a good thing because they let you talk to people online, they have ways or doing things for other people, and people have to manage alot of there money and hills on the computer. First they let you comunicate with other people, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the united states have family in a different state, and never get to see them, well, thats when computers come in handy because computers have a thing calle d vidio chat and thats where if you have a webcam you can talk to peoplem from different places around the world because you can see each other both through the camera, also there is a thing called @CAPS1 and that allows you to talk to people whenever you want if they are online, my mom got a @CAPS1 and now she chatting she hasn't seen since highschool and she is very happy to see her old friends again. secondly computers have away of people, like if you have an emergency you can go to the computer and save it. Like if you have an email you can email then if you have and emergency, there is even a thing on the computer that can call someone or even call all for along emergency. @PERCENT2 of the people in the @LOCATION1 say that a computer has many people think that from a computer. Thirdly computers help people paying there bills and with there mony. Did you know that @PERCENT3 of people in the united states pay there bills on the computer and manage there mony on the computer. I know my parents do and I know a lot of other people that do to, and if we didn't pay our bills then we wouldn't be able to have a home or anything and thats pretty much do need computers because if you didn't have them then people wouldn't have a any mony. In conclusion people really do need computers because people like people that they know and they have helped many people in the united states and lastly computers really help you manage money and bills, and every body should have a computer for all of these very good reasons.",9
1157,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 technology majors support that the use of computers have a positive effect on people and I agree with them. I believe the use of computers are a necesity for social interaction, homework, research, and are a great source of entertainment on a rainy day. After a long day at school @CAPS1 teens go from the bus, to the front door, to their computer chair. In fact, @PERCENT1 of must teens do so. Odds are they're logging into facebook, myspace, formspring, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, and other socially interactive websites. With good time management I actually find these websites important. I think facebook and e-mail and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ( @CAPS5) are a great way to be socially interactive. It's also a great way to keep in touch with long distance family or friends. I go to @DATE1 camp and have made friends I call my family. Some of them being across the ocean in @LOCATION2. Seeing as how I can't make long distance calls which would cost way too much money, facebook is a geat alternative to keep in touch. @CAPS1 of my family also live far away. For example, my aunt, uncle and cousin in @LOCATION1. My aunt just had a baby, meaning I have a new cousin which I'm not able to see in person yet so seeing pictures on facebook instead of spending money on envolopes, stamps and picture prints is really awesome @CAPS1 homework given out in school requires a computer. Three out of five homework assignments are on the computer. Whether it be taking a twenty question test to defining a word the computer is a schoolwork necesity. In school now many projects are assigned meaning we need the computer and internet. We use powerpoint and other microsoft documents whether it be typing an essay or creating a powerpoint slideshow. We need the internet for research to get the information we need, to suceed. Aside from interacting with other humans and researching and typing the computer holds many more wonders. Many people believe people are spending way too much time on the computer. While this @MONTH1 be true for some people it is not true for @CAPS1. Many people are concerned children are becoming lazy but in a recent vote @NUM1 out of @NUM2 mothers said they'd radther see their children playing and interacting on the computer then being a couch patato and watching @CAPS6. On a rainy day the computer can be a great alternative. You can slide in a @CAPS7 and watch a movie or play a game or even research something new and learn about it. @NUM3 out of @NUM2 @CAPS8 have at least two computers in the house for a reason. They're important to @CAPS1 people everyday lives. The computer is a great way to keep in touch with family and friends. You also need to computer for school almost all the time and on a rainy day its a great alternative then being lazy a watching @CAPS6 while your eyes fall asleep. I do believe computers have a positive effect on people.",12
1158,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there is an ongoing debate about the issue stating that not everyone agrees that computers benefit society. I can't understand why. Computers present many oppurtunities for people. They allow for people to communicate with each other, they allow people to research topics in a simpler way, and they teach hand-eye coordination. This is why I agree that computers do benefit society. In the modern world, nearly all businesses rely on communication. Many people in those businesses use not only phones to communicate, but computers as well. Online communication is a fast, simple, and effective way for people to communicate whether @CAPS1 is at home or at work. This is one way computers benefit all of society. Nobody knows everything, we are always trying to find out about new things that we neven knew. Sometimes we @MONTH1 use books, but the way most people use is online researching. This is because not only is @CAPS1 quicker, but simpler as well. When you research online, the information literally comes to you. All you do is type a subject to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is another reason why computers do benefit society. The final reason is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. This shows because as time progresses while you are on the computer you realize that typing becomes easier. @CAPS1 might take a while, but over time people get the hang. @CAPS1's as @CAPS1 the computer is letting you teach yourself. Some people would say that people spend too much time on computers. This isn't a problem though because people have to spend long periods of time on computers in order to do the beneficial things that computers have to offer. In conclusion, you can see that I have clearly stated the benefits of computers. They allow us to communicate, research, and improve our hand-eye coordination. This is why computers do benefit society.",8
1159,"Honestly, I totally and absolutely believe that child internet use should be cut down in the @LOCATION2, because of many reasons. And here are just a few of them. First of all, the internet can make people very obese, for example, if your friend was going to a walk to your house, but then decided to @CAPS1 you instead, he is probably not getting a lot of exercise. As a matter of fact, the leading @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1 is no longer cigarettes. It's obesity. Actually @NUM1 @CAPS3 are obese, with that number still rising. Another reason why internet use should be cut down because bullies, hacker, and terrorists. Because. And the some I believe that child in the @LOCATION2",8
1160,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, I would like to thank you in advance for taking the time to read this letter, it means a lot to me, I am writing today because it has come to my attention that some people are saying that computers do not benefit society. Those people are very wrong! Computers are amazing! They allow easier research, I can learn about other countries, and can talk to people online. I do all of this stuff alsmost every day! We're just finishing up a pretty big research assignment for english and social studies. It involved taking a note cards from different sources. Luckily, I was able to go on the card catalog on the computer and find many books on my topic, just by typing the keyword! We can narrow down our options so easily because you can search for something so specific. After you find your topic, you can check and see if there's reliable information by reading a summary. All of this can be done in about @NUM1 minutes or less.This would be nearly imposible without a computer. I have a few relative in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. A while back my family and I were trying to plan a trip to @LOCATION2 to visit. We were able to go on a search engine and find directions to their house from the airport. it gave us the directions and the estimated amount of time it would take to get there. i've also been able to do plenty of research on other foreign countries at the push of a button. it's so simple and convenient, too! My two uncles live in @LOCATION1. On thanksgiving my mother was upset because she missed them I was then able to set them up in a video chatroom so my mom could talk to them. this is great, its so convenient to be to go an instant message. i can talk to people all over the world and it doesn't even any money! In conclusion, computers are very helpul because you can learn about foreign countries, have easy access to research, and can talk online. there's a long list of other things that make computers great, but it would take too long to write. Thank you again for listening.",10
1161,"Dear local newspaper, Computers have a lot of affects on people. Some affects are it takes away from family and friends, you don't really have a social life and you don't get enough excersise. Computers take away from friends and family time. I did an interview yesterday with @PERSON1; and I asked,"" @CAPS1 you go over your grandmas house what do you usually do?"" @CAPS2 said, ""I usually use the computer."" @CAPS3 do you want to use the computer while your their? your with your family your supposed to spend time with them. Play a game like monopoly, or play @CAPS4. Those are fun and great way to interact with your family. If your family member doesn't have those games bring them! People think that because there is facebook, aim, e-mail, and myspace that your interacting with friends. You really aren't. I asked my friend @PERSON3 what @CAPS2 thought of those things and @CAPS2 said ""They are great interacting websites."" They really aren't. They are websites on the computer. While you are on the computer your not really maintaing a social life. Your town holds activites or has a fun place you could too. Your town @MONTH1 have a gym, community center, or a library. Go their and hangout with friends interact with them. Go to school, goto the library, and hang out with friends are great ways to interact with people. People don't think about @CAPS1 your sititng in your computer chair and @CAPS5. While your sitting in the chair your not excercising, @CAPS1 you keep @CAPS5 your gaining weight. You might get fatter @CAPS1 your stuffing your face wih cheez- itz and not excersising I asked @PERSON2 a question it was what do you do while your on the computer? @CAPS2 said ""I eat.."" @CAPS5 isn't bad, but @CAPS1 your not really paying attention you eat more than you need. Your town has rec leaguges of sports such as @CAPS6, softball, and baseball. Join a team instead of playing on the computer and @CAPS5. Get @CAPS7! Computers aren't the greastest things in the world. You don't stay fit with them, you aren't very social, and you don't really spend time with your family. Computers don't really help you grow up, and be mature for the future.",9
1162,"@ORGANIZATION1, Computers have great effects that are positive towards people. This is @CAPS3 it teaches hand eye cordanation, allows people to learn about far away places, and to talk to other people online. Computers have great positive effects for everyone. Computers teach hand eye cordanation. When a person is typing they are using their hands to type while looking at the monitor for the letters.

This shows the computer can help someone learn about foiren countrys and they can talk to people far away. Using the computer soemone could talk to you while your hundreds or thousands of miles away. Tehy can do this through e-mail of video chat. a @CAPS2 showed that seven out of ten people prefer video chat @CAPS3 its faster and the two people can see each other. However either way they are still fast ways to contact a person far away. Jack from @LOCATION1 said ""@CAPS3 of video chat I was able to talk to and see my cousin from @LOCATION3 who I almost never see. This gos to show that the computer is a positive thing for people.

Kids can do homework on computers, also you could video chat with friends and family finally because you could look up just about anything you want on the computer. Computers are great because kids can do there homework on the computer, thats good because if they forgot there book in school or something like that then they could just get the answers of the computer. Its also good for business men because they count on computers for all there files. Computer are also great because you can video chat with friends and family. Video chatins is awesome because if a friend or relative goes out of town they could just brings there labtop of webcam and then you can talk to them whenever.

1166,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of computers is that some people are spending to much time on computers they are good to be on for a while but not all day. So @CAPS1 first reason why I think spending to much time on computers is not a good thing because it's better to be outside doing other activities with other people all day instead you could hang out with friends and do some sports or something else and if your on the computer all day you will start to lose some friends. @CAPS1 second reason why I dont think it is good to be on the computer all day is because if your not exercising you will start to gain weight cause your sitting all day just on the computer so its good to go outside and go for a walk or you could go to a gym so you could do exercise is good for you it will keep you healthy cause I know someone who is on the computer all day and he really does not go outside because he says that computers teach you alot and they do but it is not good to be on it all day. @CAPS1 last reason on some bad effects of computers is that some people could use these computers for bad things they could be going on some bad websites and that will just make you to be on the compute even longer you could even become addicted to being on computers because your doing nothing else ans some people have cameras on their computers and some people use them for same bad things so thats why it is better not to be on a computera ll day long. So these were @CAPS1 reasons or some bad effects computers could have on people if your not go outside to do some activities or to hang out with some friends.",8
1167,"Dear @CAPS1: People are spending far to much time on computers. This go for children and adults alike. Just think about it anything you can do on a computer you can do without a computer. That and pepole need to spend mor time outside expiriencing nature. Lastly some bad things can be shown and can happen while online. I chalenge you to name one thing you can do on the computer that you can't do without. You can't even name one. Think about it you can reserch and find pictures from books and magasigns. Insted of social networking sites you can actualy go and see the person or if they are far away you can call them or write them a letter. To find out about current events you can read the newspaper or watch the news. If you like using computer disign programs try drawing a real picture instead. Lastly if you download a lot of music you can just but a cd or better yet go to see the band live. Face it you can't do ehything on a computer that actualy requires the computer. Artificial simulations are no mach for the real outdoors. On a computer all you can do is watch and even that is nothing compared to the real thing it's just a snapshot of it. Outside you can the gentel breses the warm sun the cool grass, you can smell fresh pine and clean air. You can hear all the other cretures surounding you. Going outside is better for you to. Outside you get exersize and vitimin @CAPS2 while inside you get fat lazy and sick. Can't you see how great the outdoors are? Computers can do more harm than good. They can show children inapropriat pictures and talk about inapropriat topics. They are even now using computers to sell illegal drugs. Children allso often use the internet irrisponsibly and to things that can dissrupt frendships and get them into truble. The computer has also made it alot easyer for kidnappers to find children and kidnapp them. They do this by pretending to be the childs peer then using the information the child him he will make almost a garunteed kidnapping. This is happening more and more frequently. The computer isn't as helpful as you thought. Computers are not realy benificial to our socity. They have no rel use that isn't alredy taken care of. The can not replace the real outdoors. Lastly they can be eisily used for bad even ilegal purpuses. As you can see computers should be used as much as they are being used by the general public.",8
1168,I think computers are good because you can talk to your friends and family on the computers. People needs computers to look for a job. Some people spend to much time on the computers then on homework people need to stop.,2
1169,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people at my school sit on there computers after school. They don't go outside and enjoy nature. Visit with family and friends or even exercise. @CAPS2 people are affected by this. Going outside can enchance your knowledge, you can go on a walk in the woods. When you are on your walk you @CAPS2 find interesting new species. Also when you are outside you can play with your friends or siblings. @CAPS2 times in neighborhoods there are a lot of kids, you can start a pick of game of baseball. You can also build new things. You could find a big tree and build a treehouse or tireswing with your family. Going outside leaves you with a lot of fun activites. When kids sit on the computer they don't interact with there family or friends. During the @DATE1 you can go to the beach with your friends. It will cool you down without having to pay money for an air conditioner. You @MONTH1 also find the oportunety to go to a different state for the day. Or you could go acros the country to see your sick grandma or your newly named cousin. Going on a picnic will give you time to get to know new people. You could invite friends and have them bring a new friend for the whole group to met. You will also have a lot of tasty food and who wouldn't want that? Going places with your family and friends can pad to a worth wild experinse. @PERCENT1 of kids chose to go on the computer than to exercise. Kids will become overweight. When on the computer @CAPS2 kids will eat. Eating for hours each day to not a good idea. You can go out for your schools basketball team or run distances in cross country. Once you are on the team you will make new friends, and get your exercise for the day. When you are on a team and exercising you will learn @CAPS2 life skills. You will learn the benifits of working as a team and by yourself. So getting your exersise is a very important role in your life. Why would you choose the computer? You wouldn't be able to enjoy the outdoors. Or spend time with family and friends. You would become over weight and unhappy. So, don't choose the computer, choose another activity!",8
1170,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think computers have a possitive effect on people? I know I @CAPS2. Computers are good for many reasons: @NUM1 reason is because people can learn about far away places; @NUM2 they can talk to people and learn about their culture and @NUM3 they can teach hand eye coordination. First off if you're taking you want to learn about where you are going. Computers can help with that! Also if you want to find good hotels you can use the computer for that. If you need transportation just log onto google and type in what you're looking for. Now if you are doing a project for school or something on a different area of the world you can log onto your skype, facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or any other website that you. You can @CAPS2 many things while talking to freinds on the internet, such as: find out school assignments, find out due dates, make dates and many more wonderfull things. Hand-eye coordination is very important. Computers can help with that. Drivers need very good hand-eye coordination; if you don't have that then plan on a big insurece bill. If you don't have good hand eye coordination then you are going to have a hard time with a lot of stuff. So thats why computers are a good thing to have in our society. You can learn about where you are going, stuff that you need to get done, and even become a better driver.",8
1171,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Three reasons why I think computers have a positive effect on people are that you have the ability to talk to your friends and family, also talk to other people around the world and you can even shop online. Without contact with your loved ones is sad because if you wanna talk to them you can email them to see how they are doing. With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world. One example of this is if you have a friends in @LOCATION1 and you wanna see if he's doing @CAPS2 you can send him a message. Talking to people on the web is really fun because you can se what or people are playing games with you. If you are on facebook or myspace you can add people as your friends so you can friends. Shopping online is more faster and more quicker than shopping at. is that if you shopping for clothes and there's a then you'll start to go that's why there is online shoping so that we can. You can. In conclusion is a very useful thing. talk to your relatives from @LOCATION2 and you can shopping without the waiting in line. The can talk to other the world.",7
1172,"I walked outside to get the mail and newspaper. I saw the front page talking about computer. An article said, too much computer using. I though there wasn't going to sell more computer but, it said that people are using computers and are not exercising much. I think that people are not going to have a hard time quitting to use their computer. I had a friend that didn't know how to use the computer. He past his hour playing outside. In the @DATE1 he tries out for @CAPS1 baseball. He is a very good athlete. He does grate in school too. Others people without a gob are not looking for something 'to do they are at the computer everyday. When they should be doing work around and inside the house. Peoples with computers shouldn't be all day like these friend my friend haves is using his computer everytime he comes from school. He don't do his homework on time. Every time he doesn't want to go out and exercise his mind or get a little bit of sun he sometimes don't eat so he should give his brain a rest and do physical things that will help them. Other person such as the computer workers should write a note to people with computer saying how computer can be addicted to people and maybe realize how much often they should use their computer and was using it to go to get information and to collage. She started to use the computer to chat with people and ended up using the computer a lot and not going to collage. I believe that computers are an major impact on people. People should be going about to have fun get sunlight not staying at the computer all the time. Many adults don't use the computer is most the teens and kids. People should go to the gym and build strong muscles. They should stay away from computer for a time. Agains computer would be the right thing to do.",8
1173,"Dear @LOCATION1, minute man, people are complaining. They are complaining about how computers interfer with their family and life. But it teaches adults and kids new things. Being on the computer is an exeperince. You can almost search anything on the computer. You can learn history or about the present time. Like one time I was searching (@CAPS1.com) on how to fix a playstation @NUM1 controller. I found out how to do it and it worked. While you are on the computer you can interact with friends, find out about the weather, and find out if you have any homework. The computer also teaches you how to do different stuff. Like this one time I learned to do a hardflip. Also computer's can help you with your homework. Like if you have science homework and you're trying to figure a word out you can search it. Or if you're looking for a book for @LOCATION2 you can search websites for good books or ask a friend. The computer helps many different people in many different ways. And you know how people say computers are bad. If you have a t.v. for game system its like having a computer, right? But don't go kill your self looking for a cheap one. But I do suggest that everyone should have a computer, they are helpful and fun.",8
1174,"Dear local newspaper, I has come to my attention that many of us disagree on weather computers have a negative or positive effect on people. I believe that computers do not benefit society. Many people in today's modern world spend way to much time on the computer when they could be exercising, spending time with family and friends, and enjoying nature. Read on and I am sure you will agree. First of all, computers are becoming a problem in society because they interfear with our physical well being. The @LOCATION1 is continuingly growing. Not in our population but the size of our people! According to a recent survey @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people in the @LOCATION1 are overweight or obease. ""The main culprit of the @ORGANIZATION2's percent of obeasity is not over eating it is actually electronics! Especially things like computers."" said @PERSON1 a surgean at @ORGANIZATION1, after dealing with a severe case of obesity. Obesity is not a hard thing to get rid of. All we have to do is instead of sitting for hours staring at a screen. America needs to get outside! It can be as simple as riding a bike or taking your dog for a walk. Whatever you do just get off your computer and go outside or the gym for exercise! Secondly, computers interfere with family and friends. I know from personal experience that parents hate it when their kids will miss family dinner or won't go out with their friends because they ""need"" to finish the next level on their game or they ""need"" to look something up on the internet. Family and friends should be a very important thing in your life but unfortunatly, for most people it is not. Psycologist, @PERSON2 has discovered that overall, having family and friends that you can count on beside you will make you a much happier more enjoyable person."" @CAPS1 eliminating computers from our lives we will create a happy and more pleasent society for the people of the @LOCATION1. Doing everyone a favor. Furthermore, if we cut back on our hours on the computer we will have a better chance to expeirence the wonder's mother nature has to offer us. Most people don't realize how much they are missing @CAPS1 not going outside. There are amazing things, right in your own backyard, that you will probably never get to expeirience because you are too addicted to playing on the computer. @NUM3 years ago people were able to function fine with out computers so we should be able to too. @PERCENT1 of people have never even been camping! So next time you feel like spending another @NUM4 hours on the computer, take a walk and I'm sure you will be amazed at what you find outdoors. In conclusion, computers do not benefit society. They just keep people away from going outside, enjoying nature and spending time with family and friends. I hope I have convinced you to see my side of the argument and thank you for your time.",12
1175,"Dear local Newspaper, I believe that people who uses alot of technology such as computer are not good, technology can affect adults and even more is children. Children who go on chatting websites such as facebook are starting to see a difference which is in there grades. I found out children who gois on face book are starting to not turn in home work and there grades are going completly down, I heard a student say once he had got on face book he stoped doing his homework and reading his grade dropeed from a @CAPS1 t a @CAPS2 average because he was much focused on the computer than school and his reading. I belive computers can be really addicted to people the first time you get on a website it go's from once a day to twice a day and further on its as if the computer is sometime connected to you and we can let go. People who allow themself to chat online can also be a dangerous thing, young females and males think its exciting to chat with some one in a different state or city but its not exciting its very dangerous. Chating online is very dangerous because the person that you are talking to could have murdered people or could have kidnapped kids or could be wanied but we wouldn't know because on chat lines you dont have to put your fear name, you could put a false picture, and unknown age that's why in cases something go missing because they didd'ent think before they started chating. Another reason why using or being on a computer can be bad because it can lead to a strong distraction from you family instead of sitting down and asking your family now was thier day you'll be in a rush to go on the computer. The computer can also lower you test and quiz grades you can be on the computer for a maximum of hours that you need to be studying for a huge exam the next day and when you fail theres no one to blame but yourself because of your addiction to the usage of an computer. In conclusion @PERCENT1 of people have been affected by computers and its not a good thing you could miss a day out of work or you can be tired and exhaused because all your energy is wasted stay off of computers unless educational.",7

1177,"I completely agree with those people who think computers have a negative effect on us today. Even though computers are great they do have many negative effects on people who use them. Since. new technology, and post pictures on websites where everyone can see. Also they have games for computers that people get hooked on. Lastly, there are predator online. The new technology is amazing, like webcams where you can video chat or cellphones where you could take pictures, @CAPS1 they do have negative effects. There have been many suicides over cyber bullying. This is where people bully kids over the internet. Also some people send naked pictures online or even while webcamming. this is illegal and absurd that young or even older people would be doing these actions. Also there are websites where people can post these pictures of you that are very personal and make a huge difference in you life. There are many people who have games for their computer or download games off of websites. Most people actually get addicted to the game, They would play it all day if they could and if they arent playing they are wishing they could. This makes them miss out on alot of things. They might not get enough excersise or not do any homework which will make you grades drop. They could also not be spending time with family. It also might change who you are as a person. The most important thing about the use of computers is your safety. There are predator all over the internet and can pretend they are someone from school and ask where you live. You should never tell anyone where you live or your full name online. They can and most likely will come to your house for you. It could most likely cost you or even family members your lives. Computers can be fun and you can learn an abundant amount of information but as long as you smart about using it. Remember not to tell anyone where you live or dont take pictures and send them that are personal. They could be all over the internet the next day. Lastly, worry about your family, grades, and health than some useless game. Be smart and safe!",8
1178,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 on a beautiful sunny day, people inside on their computers instead of enjoying the weather. This is what could happen if people are using them. I believe that computers have a bad effect on people because their communication skills will drop, people won't get enough exercise & their health can be imnarred. As i mentioned, everyone who is using a computer on a daily basis, will drop their communication skills.. People enter chat rooms not knowing who they are talking to. For example, if i logged onto & chat room, someone might ask for personal information such as where you live, your phone number & your name. This could lead to things such as kidnaping & even rape. Also, interactions with family members & friends @MONTH1 decrease. You can be playing a computer game, online, or going on youtube to watch random videos of people. You tube in said to be a dangerous site for younger children. Kids could go under history to go to a website they were recently on when click the wrong one bringing them inapropiate website. Finally, teenagers and adults go onto facebook & twitter. Some @MONTH1 say these sites @MONTH1 change the social interactions, but it really isn't. Kids & adults are constantly getting addicted to it. Also telling people what you are doing every moments of your day everyday is kind of unreal. People don't need to know when you do things in your day i have keep up this our communication skills are sure to decrease. Secondly, exersice is a problem. Doctors say that @PERCENT1 of their parents are obeise or over weight according to @ORGANIZATION1. Kid just sit at home & play computer games such as sims @NUM1 & video chat with their friends instead of hanging out with them. No one really goes for walks any more either. Also, people don't go out & enjoy nature like the you. @PERSON1, a state @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION2 said, ""each year the number of people are getting fewer & fewer. Preety soon all parks are going to have to get closed down."" @CAPS2 don't want this to happen, do you? I know i would not. Our generations are just becoming more technology enhanced. Finally, more & more people are becomeing unhealthy. A person's eye sight is most likely to drop if they are on the computer everyday. My aunt is required to use her computer everyday at work. She went to her eye doctor because her vision was become weaker. One of the first questions he aske was, do you use a computer on a daily basis? she answered yes. He said she would need cataraks eye surgery. This was all in result of using a computer. Finally, you could get althritis in your hands & fingers from typing & using the mouse all the time. Many people at the age of fourty are probaly going to need hand surgeries from all the work the do, likes! As you can see technology is harming your communication skills, exersice & you health. I bet you don't want your future generations like this. So take a part & contact your local newspaper today.",10
1179,"Has your daughter or son ever asked you that they want computer in their school? Were you ever baffled when they said they were talkking about @CAPS2 in the school, that they can teach hand eye coordination, gives them the ability to learn from far away places, or even allow them to talk to people all around the world? What did you think about that? Did you agree? If you did then your thinking about the positive side and not the negative. Many reasons why I don’t agree. Saftey, the money, health. Many people said that its good to interact with other people but not all the time if your son or daughter interacts with people they @CAPS1 know are you going to be worried.? They can be asked who they are, were they live. Sometimes they even ask if they can meet up face to face. My friend @PERSON2 said her school got those computers and her friend @PERSON3 was asked to meet or with somebody she never knew and she ended up saying yes and @PERSON2 says she nevered showed up. Would you ever want that to happen to your child? Well this is only the begining. Once your child’s school gets computers they will be addicted to @CAPS2, @PERSON1 said that ""if a child does not go out and enjoy there childhood but they want concentrate on their homework, they will just eat and be on the computer eventually they will become obese.” @CAPS2 is very imperative that your child does go out and have fun and get exercise because then they will just be on the computers @NUM1. Have you ever wondered that? Another thing is the school will have to pay alot of money, if your child ever damages the computers then you will also have to pay a lot of money too. Not only if your childs school gets computers @CAPS2 will benefit you guys alot. I trolly and sincerly do not belive that students should get computers. Also your students computers @MONTH1 get viruses because of inappropriate sites. Then your going to pay for that as well. Lastly the school will not have enough money for materials. What will you do?!? Your child is not there to be addicted to computers your child is there for education! Do you still support these computers!? I hope not because there is a @PERCENT1 chance that they will or will not get @CAPS2. Hopefully I gave you enough information about the saftey, money and health. This is very urgent situation so please be aware.",8
1180,"@ORGANIZATION1, The delema over computers needs to be noticed. People need to relize computers are one of the greatest inventions we have in our time, but in my opinion people take that as an advantage and misuse them for purposes that they should not be used. Computers are not meant to be for playing games, or constently instent messaging. They are meant for learning purposes and for work or school. Why do people use computars for things that they dont need? People use computers for fun! They instant message, listen to music, go on @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3. People also use @CAPS4 and play games on unknown websites. Computers are not ment to be for that, they are for school and work. @ORGANIZATION2, word, @ORGANIZATION2, and powerpoint, if computers were used for those purposes people wouldnt be the way they are today. In the @LOCATION1 the computer is very popular people aboulutly love it! But these people are the people who are unfriendly, mean and sad. They also are incredibly out of shape. I know so many people who use computers instead of doing homework and getting fresh air. They are so independent they do when they go home from school is eat and play on the computer. I have a hard time understanding why they do that but I guess they feel they have nothing else better to do. I also know people who use the computer the right way and they are very happy people. They also have so much knowledge and there is never a dull conversationthem. Those people use the computer everyday but they use it correctly only for and they are just well are very smart and get good grades in school! Basically, what I am trying to say is that people who use the computer suceed in anything they do because they know how to use and understand the computer, but people who use it in the wrong ways will just be miserable because they dont know to much, they had average grades and they are unhealthey.",8
1181,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know that two out of three @CAPS2 own a computer? Computers are a very helpful tool that benefit everyone in society. They allow people to communicate with eachother, learn, and teach hand-eye coordination and other good things for school.. Computers are a very useful and beneficial part of society. The advance in technology has upgraded computers, and now allows people to communicate through them. For example, new webcams allow people to actually see and talk to each other from you computer screen. This allows people no matter how far to talk to each other and stay in touch. With my webcam I am able to keep in touch with my cousins in @LOCATION1. Another way of communication is through email. Through the internet, people can type messages back and forth. It is very fast and easy allowing people to talk to each other more and communicate. As well as webcams and email computers grants people access to communication websites such as @CAPS3 (instant messaging) or @CAPS4. These websites people message each other back and forth very quickly and easily. It is not difficult to do, like writing a letter would be, so people can communicate more efficiently and easily. Computers are very helpful for communication along with @CAPS6. Computers are an advancement that could help people learn more about anything. For instace, they could learn about foreigh plaus. All they would have to do is go to the internet, type what they were @CAPS5 for, and it would come up on the screen. It would allow people to learn about places all over the world. Also, people can see pictures on the computer. For example, if someone wanted to go on vacation faraway, they could type in the place and see what it looks like. However, the computer does not just show places. People could also see animals, other people, the environments, and anything else they want to learn about. Plus, with new websites being created, people could actually see what the earth looks like from space. They can look at houses, the wonders of the world, and much more computers give people the opportunity to learn about so much more. @CAPS6 more would help people, especially students to have a better education. If you ask anyone in school, they will tell you that computers are a very useful tool. Firstly it allows them to type. Students can type a project or paper on the computer faster and easier. It will also look neater and more orginized. Plus, computers teach students hand-eye coordination. By typing or even just clicking the mouse, students are bettering their coordination. This is due to the fast while they are @CAPS5 at the screen and typing or clicking, they have a sense of direction and know what to hit or where to put their hands without even @CAPS5. Lastly, computers help students because if they need help, they can just ask one of their friends through the computer. Students would better understand the content they are @CAPS6 and when they go to school, they would already know it. Therefore, computers would lead to students getting better grades. Computers play a big role in society today. They are a way of communication, @CAPS6, and allows students to do better in school. Overall, computers are a very beneficial tool in our society.",10
1182,"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I feel that those people that think computers do not benefit society, are right. I feel this way because people need to start exercising it more, and interact with family and friends. Also, should enjoy life. Please read on to read in detail, as to why I feel this way. Firstly, those who are always on the computer need to exercise more, they need to exercise to stay healthy and strong. If they don't, they will most likely eat more and gain a lot of unwanted fat. Also, some of them don't even exercise at all. Secondly, they don't interact with their family and friends as much. Those people tend to probably argue with their family because they had to get off of computer. When you fight with people you want to gey away from it so you go back to the computer. It's not healthy to be on the computer for long periods at a time. Lastly, they should enjoy life. See the world through their own eyes. Party with friends and family. Go to college and do something with their lives. They need to enjoy things how they originally were without any computers, ipods, or even cellphones. In conclusion, the reasons I feel this why are because people need to exercise more, and interact with family and friends. Also, they need to enjoy life. I hope you understand as to why I feel this way.",7
1183,Computer are good and bad because computers are good because that is a way we can comunicate with other people in different states. Another reason computers are good because they can keep you out of trouble and can keep you entertained. Computers are bad because they can become a computer. Freak and become highper when it comes to computers. Computers are good because it can do alot of things that other objects cannot do.,4
1184,"Dear editor, Have you ever used a computer? Odds are you have, which means you know how convienient and positive computers are. Did you know @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS1 use computers regularly? These technological marvels provide many ways to communicate and learn, showing computers have an extremely positive effect on people. Who hasn't ever played a game on a computer? Computers provide many forms of entertianment, such as games, music, and videos. I once has to drive @NUM1 hours to see my grandma in @LOCATION1. The only thing that kept me away from the grasp of boredom during the trip was my portable computer, that I played games and watched movies on. Critics of computers argue that people who use computers do not ever participate in physical activities. Of course, try exercising when you are crammed in a car traveling @NUM2 @CAPS2, which is computers positively affect me. It was @NUM3 on a @DATE1 @TIME1, and my mother was just about to have a baby. Unfortunately, none of my relatives were there to witness this baby coming into the world because the all live on the other side of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS3, this minor set back did not prevent them from seeing the @LOCATION1 baby, and thanks to computers, they didn't even have to leave their homes. This is because computers offer many ways to be social, such as social networking sites. Within @NUM4 hours after the baby was born. there were many pictures and videos up on these social networking sites that let everyone enjoy my @LOCATION1 baby sister. Computers make life convienient for all. Last but not least, computers are not only a fine tool for school, but are necessary to succeed with your education. One snows day in @DATE2, I was assigned a research paper on @PERSON1. Too bad I didn't know one thing about @PERSON1, so I asked my mom to drive me to the library to take out some books for my report but due to the snow, the library's power went out and therefore they were closed. This was not an issue, though, beacuse I only had to spend @NUM5 minutes on a computer searching for information, instead of spending hours browsing through countless pages in a book. Thanks to computers, I received an A on my report. Overall, computers serve many helpful purposes for people. These marvelous machines can provide entertainment, socialize with people around the world, and even provide information on any topic you would like. @ORGANIZATION1 readers, now you understand why computers are positive for your lives and everyone elses. I encourage all of you to spread this message to everyone, so they know all the benefits to using computers.",8
1185,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you think computer have a positive or negative affect on people? I think it has a Positive affect. There are a few reasons for this. First, computers are used for education around the world. Second, it helps us connect with and meet new friends. Lastly, You can use a computer for world news. As you can see, those are just a few reasons. First, Computers are used for education around the world. For example some people use it to go to college online. Others use it to find information on things like egypt, where we cant go. Second, it helps us connect with, and meet new friend. We can chat with our friends, which is very useful. If we need to know what a homework assignment was we can just chat with a friend. Lastly, You can use computer to find out about world news. We can go and find out if something serious happened, like the earthquake in haiti. As you can see, those are just a few reasons I think that computers have a positive affect on us. I hope you agree with me. ",7
1186,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 a family. Just a normal family whose lives have been changed due to computers. They are overweight, constantly suffering from fatigue, lonely, nature deprived and lazy. However, they could of turned out differently if they just shut down their computers. They might of healthy. fit, energetic, radiant, hardworking people if they had stopped spending hours on the computer daily. Although there are some positive computers can be dramatic. They isolate you from friends and family, they deprive you of the nature around you, and most of all, they @MONTH1 cause you to become overweight or even obease. Friends and family are two very important things in everybody's life, even if you dont realize it. By using computers rather than interacting with them, you are the connections you have. Computers @MONTH1 cause you to isolate yourself. They might cause you to talk to your . Unfortunatley, friendships can be . ""Spending long hours on my computer had caused me to become . made me fell lonely, @PERSON1, @NUM1, says @CAPS2, by the use of computers you are doing yourself a favor. Computer can deprive you of the nature that surrounds you. You most likely would be on you ocmputer rather than going outside. Instead of spending countless hours on the computer, you could be playing a sport or activity. By playing sports you are increasing you hand eye coordination, far more then if you were to be on a computer. Wouldnt you like to be having funs with your friends playing vollyball, basketball, swimming or even going rather then sitting infront of your computer? I know I would! The obesity rates of this country will increse if people continue to use computers. You will rize about @PERCENT1 from lack of exersize. Computers can ruin lives by increasing your chance of becoming unhealithy overweight. So now think, would you want to be lonely, overweight, and deprived of nature? I know i definiely wouldn't. why computers should be used less frequently! So hows the time; lets join together and raise awareness of the negitive effects of computer!",9
1187,"Dear @LOCATION1 news paper, I think computers are a bad and good thing because computers keep some people inside more than usual and then on the other hand a computer allows you to talk with family members that you haven't seen in a long time, search for upcoming events and see if they are canceled and to search up other stuff like when a movie is playing. Computers are a big part of school too, because without computers it would be hard to study and for some teachers most of their homeworks aquires you to use a computer. There is some other things that are bad about computers too for example: my friend stayed on his computer playing video games for most of the day. Its like when he's on that computer he dosen't listen or hear anyone, not even his parents. He barely goes down to eat dinner and when he does he has his laptop right beside him. His parents started to get tired of it so they took his tv and laptop away so he could go outside and play with his friends. After a while he started to come outside a lot mostly every day when it was nice. They gave him back his computer and tv. The only time he goes on it now is rainy days.",7
1188,"I support the advance in technology especially in computers. Using the computer can teach hand-eye coordination, give you the ability to learn about faraway places or people, and give you the opportunity to talk online with other people. Hand-eye coordination is a very important skill to have. it quickens reflexes during everyday life. Hand-eye coordination is needed especially for sports like baseball, football, or basketball. Without computers, many people would lack hand-eye coordination. If you are driving a car on the highway, when suddenly a car swerves onto the wrong side of the road and is heading toward you, you need to react fast. Without hand-eye, you could die. Using computers could possibly save your life one day. If somebody wants to go to a foreign country, but doesn't know anything about it, he could lost it we on the internet. The internet is a major part in having computers. Without it, people probably wouldn't be able to research a country with ease or learn about other people. Some people @MONTH1 think that using the computer too much restricts people from getting exercise, which is true in some cases, but the computer is very useful to have if you want to know about something. Like who won the election, or who won the sports championship. The computers is almost a neccesity in every home. The computer gives people the opportunity to chat online with other people. Some they @MONTH1 know in real life, or some they met online. It expands peoples interactive life, helping them make new friends. Though this is great thing to have acces to, it is still important to socialize with people in person, rather than socializing online. Some people have trouble talking to people in person and more comfortable chatting over the computer. Maybe this person could make a friend, and one day meet them in real life. This @MONTH1 be dangerous for younger people, so be careful. I support the advancement in computer technology because it gives people greater reflexs, gives people the opportuniyt to research faraway places, and gives people access to the internet to chat with people online. These are three huge advantages than using computers give people.",8
1189,"You want my opinion on the effects computers have on people? Well, I believe that computers help people educate people and some computers people relie on. It's time to decide if you agree with me that computers have positive effects on people. Do you agree with me that computers can help people? Say for example you have a question noone in your home can answer. Why not @ORGANIZATION2 it? Of course once in a while you're going to get a school project. Surely you'll need information, but the library is closed. And you don't @CAPS3 what to do. Simple, all you have to do is reasearch it on your computer. Don't you agree that computers help people? I remember this one time I entered a @CAPS1 contest, and the @CAPS2 I needed was lost, then I remembered I put it in my computer. Computers can be relied on by people. Just think about it! Almost over @PERCENT1 of jobs out in the world relie on the technology of a computer. For example the @ORGANIZATION1 job. It would be kind of hard to keep track of how much trash is thrown out every year without a computer, surely banks use computers too! To keep track of everyone's allowance and money situations. Let's not forget about what lawyers do? There are some lawyers incart who use the computer to type up every word said. They turn the words into short and to keep up with what people are saying. Did you @CAPS3 that without these computers ever half the million jobs in the world would fail? Some people would agree that some online games are educational. For example, there is @CAPS4. That game teaches you words you probably never seen before. And don't forget @CAPS5. That game improves your counting of numbers. Last, but not least would be @CAPS6 @CAPS7. That game sharpens your skill and exercises your brain. Strategy come in handy, surely you now see that some games are very educational. In conclusion, I agree that the effects computers have on people are positive. Because computers help people, are reliable, and can educate people. It's now or never do you agree that computers have positive effects on people?",10

1191,"New @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers is a benefit to society. Most people not think so but there are many reasons why they are. People will always have something to do when they are bored, there is plenty to learn, and it keeps you organized. After reading this paper, you will agree with me that computers are a benefit. Do you ever get bored and have nothing to do ? Well if you have a computer around, there are endless things to keep you busy. People can talk to their friends and keep in teach with them. No matter how far away they go. There are many websites that have games you can play. Any type of game they are all on the computer. You @MONTH1 be thinking, "" I might get addicted to a game and never want to take my eys off the screen. Well, in that case, you can always set a timer on it to give you a certain amount of time, but don't worry, it warns you before it shuts down on you. The computer isnt' all fun and games though. It is filled with knowledge, it's like the brain of @NUM1 scientists and mathematicans put together. If you have a school assignment in write a paper on someone famous, you can research them on the computer for a quick way to get information. There will be plety of websites about that person. Also, everyday there are news updates about what is going on in the world. You never have to worry about not knowing whats going on. Do you like to stay organizes I personally, think it's easier to get through life and everyday, knowing where things are and staying organized. The computer is a great, easy way to keep organized. There are many programs that you can use to write documents, make graphs and whatever you need to do. About <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of working people need the computer to do their job and keep track of everything. @PERCENT1 of the working humans is a larger amount.

1192,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you imagine a world where technology controls human interaction? Its not such a far fetched idea. Some people @MONTH1 see this as a great advancement. Not me. I think that computers detach people from reality, create false personas, and has no physical benefit. This is what i think the computers effects have on people. First of all, Computers detach people from reality. Its a lot easier for someone to sit on the computer, browsing aimlessly on some social networking website, than go out and actually meet new people. Sure you @CAPS2 send all the friend requests you want, but theres nothing that compares to a first impression that you get from meeting someone in person. The computer can also have an affect on family members and the time spent with them. Secondly, the computer creates false personas. If i had a facebook or @CAPS3 account, it would be very easy to say something false about myself, or someone else. The computer dosn't know better. This allows people to gain, ""friendships"" with others that dont know the real you. I find this as a real problem because eventually lead to shaky or unsteady relationshops. Lastly, I think that the computer offers no physical gain, This nation is in a severe heath crisis. With things easier to get now a days like fast food, and drugs, I don't think that computers help. People need discipline and theres a time and place for everything, including computers. However those that aren't disciplined might use them more than they need to and that isn't good. So @CAPS2 you imagine a world controlled by computers? I think that little by little, thats whats happening, slowly taking away the human element. I think the effects will be severe, detaching reality, creating false personas, and offering no physical gain. I don't think its right, but I hope I've persuaded you to think my way.",10

1194,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people, are that computers are used for the wrong reasons. Teens should be outside playing sports or hanging out with friends and family. But instead they are addicted to the world wide web and games and websites throughout it. Therefore, the computer and the concept of surfing the web is bad because it consumes childrens much and because educationally computers can give the wrong information. Until the late @DATE1's, @ORGANIZATION3 laptops and desktop @CAPS2 did not exist in @CAPS1 opinion, this would have been better. For example. children teens and even adults use the computer more than they should nowadays. At this age middle schoolers and high-schoolers should be focused on their grades and their . But instead, they get too addicted to @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 that they forget about their school work and their priorities, and their grades start to slip. Even sudlts have this problem. For instance, buisness people, accountants and assistants will consistently be checking their emails. Also, people who work at a desk or in a cudical all day are almost always on the computer. In other words, I believe that jobs should cut dwn on how many workers they have on a computer, and family homes should cut down on the amount of time each member spends online. Another reason I think computers effect people in a bad way is because educationally computers can give false information. For example, people could insect their own perspective of an idea on websites such as wikipedia and @ORGANIZATION2. If a student was doing a project or just homework and decided to surf the web for some @ORGANIZATION2 or information they dont know if their information is correct. I believe this means that the internet and the web don't beat books or history. In conclusion, computers have a bad effect on people for the reasons of it consumes children and teen's minds, people use the internet too much and because educationally computers can sometimes give false information.",8
1195,"Dear newspaper editor, In my opion computers have a positive effect on people. The @CAPS1 allows people to communicat. People can learn bout things, places, even their own family. I also think that with a appropiate dosage it could help your body. If the @CAPS1 was never invented how would you talk to people from around the world. Mr. editor what if you were fourteen and had no friends. Well you could always go on myspace.com, facebook.com, or any other online community and make friends. Another thing that could happen is a family member or friend goes to another country for a vacaition and can't have long distance calls, you can talk to them on @CAPS2 or something like that. If your not really into using the @CAPS1 for communication you could learn. With the @CAPS1 you could learn a lot. You can even go to school online, but as I was saying you can learn about anything. One time when I had a project at school on fredrick douglas I used the @CAPS1 for help. I learned bout his family, his childhood, were he's from, and lots of other important facts. The @CAPS1 can be a good search enging but don't stay for to long your body needs you too. I think think the @CAPS1 better can your health. People always say if stay on the computer you get fat and unhealthy, but I don't think that.

A pound no imagin how much wiget you will gain if you do that every day alot! My next reason why I think computers are in a way bad is because when you are the computer too long your eyes start to hurt and your hands start to cramp and everything starts to hurt to much typing and looking at the same thing for along to can make you have eye problems and can also give you something in your hands and then you will not to be able to do anything with your hands for along time because it will start hurting. My last reason why i think computers in a way are bad because it can mess your computers up it can over heat or just down because you have ben on it for too long. It can also get a virese then you will just have to get a whole new computer @CAPS1 you can see there are plenty of reasons why I think computers are kinda bad",8

Computers improve our hand-eye coordinations typing is a good way to improve this vital skill by not looking and knowing which buttons are where. Using a mouse is also a good to improve by moving the digital mouse with the one in your hand. This can improve foster writing, because you are moving the friend in your hand the same way you would move a mouse or type. This can also help driving, because you can't look at the wheel, you have to keep your eyes on the word, and in order to do that you most know how you're moving the wheel. Computers can help hand-eye coordination which can help with writing and driving, with typing and and moving a mouse. Computers can increase our knowledge about faraway places, and people. Cultures come in a variety we can learn about all of them from the comfort of our own home. We can also learn about nature from our home. Learning about different cultures can teach us many things. Like what kind of clothes they wore, food they ate, place the, lived in. This allows us to change our own culture by getting inspired from others. Learning about new places can help broaden the mind about other spots in the world that can lead to a vacation. Lastly, computers allow us to internet with friends from our chairs. Chatting, and e-mailing and video chatting are all great ways to interact. With a webcam you can even see the other person as if you here face-to-face with them. You can also e-mail important files, such as pictures, docucuments, and even videos. This can help with someone's job. In conclusion, computers can teach us hand-eye coordination, can teach us about faraway places and people, and lets us interact and share with friends. Computers are a very important part of my life.",9

1200,"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers have a coolest effect on people. It allows people to develop hand-eye coordination, allow people to learn about faraway people and cultures, and communicate online through e-mail or instant messaging.

Plus computers let you chat to people on there computer even if you can't call them. Another reason why I love computer are because when I have to write a project I can just type it!!! Computers make eveything easier. So, @CAPS2 consider liking computers. Initially, imagine you have a project due in two days. Your mom can't drive you to the library and you have no information on the subject. But hey, don't you have a computer. You can use the computer to lock up your subject and a @CAPS3 different websites will come speed quick to your screen.

1202,"Dear Newspaper, I think Computers are a good effect in our lives. Some of the reasons why I say this is the good to use when researching has fun games and activities, and they keep you in touch with long distant reletives. First if you just been given a assignment for school or work you @MONTH1 have to type and research on what ever topic a computer is a great source of knowledge if researching something or even checking your bills, @CAPS1, Computers are fun they have lots of games and activities for you to play and do. Just think you sitting in the house on a rainy day bored out you mind and have no thing to do. Just go on your computer and play some game or just find some activities you whole family could do. Lastly, Computers are good to stay in contact with long distant family members these days all you have to do is get a web cam and hours it up to your computer and now its they our grandma, grandpa, cousin, and uncle, or who ever is right there you can talk to them like you were on the phone with no cost. In conclusion, as you can see after all I wrote computers, are good for researching, playing games or doing activities, and staying in touch with family I @CAPS2 in my house the computer is mostly used for the web cam to see my grandma in @LOCATION1. Well I hope this letter changed you oppinion on this great invention, the computer.",7
1203,"Have you ever had someone move away and you wanted to keep in touch? Well having a computer allows this to happen. @CAPS4, it gives students the to learn different places. People and much more. But why do some people not hire them? First computers allow you to talk online with friends and family. For example using email, @CAPS1 and video chat for example I have a friend who moved away and now we email back and forth to keep in touch. @CAPS1 allows people to chat instintly and upload pictures and videos. For examples my @CAPS2 @CAPS3 pictures of my baby cousins so people can see how their growing up. Lastly, some buessnesses use a webcam to talk to other people. Say the boss on a the but to see how he employees were doing withness him he could hook up a web cam and have a conversation with them. That is how computers allow people to the @CAPS4, computers @CAPS4 people to learn about things, for example if a student rod to make a topic they could type the topic a website like bring or google and they could find all the answers they needed to help them with their project. @CAPS4 if a family wanted to go on to see they could search for it and find a hotell and sites they might want to see that is how computer allows people so that the reader can read their hand writing. @CAPS4 they help pay taxes. For example, turbo tax is an online program that allows people to pay taxes online and it remembers every tax you have paid. So if some company sends you a notice saying you havent payed a bill you can go on turbo tax and check. So reader these are some ways why people should enjoy computers. They allow people to talk to friends and family by email, @CAPS1, and @CAPS4 by webcam. They @CAPS4 give people the ability to learn information faraway places and people. Lastly what is so bad about having a computer? They allow people to pay taxes online and @CAPS4 type papers. Computers are needed in this day and age or else some people would not be able to survive without them. So reader these are some reasons why people should easily computers.",9
1204,"You need to gather information for a project you're presenting in school, but how are you going to find aout about your topic quickly and easily? Most people will turn to one of the most commonly used piece of technology in the @LOCATION1, the computer. The computer is used for quick and easy research, interacting and communicating with friends and for personal entertainment. Some peol argue that the computer will take away from enjoying nature, spending time with family and friends and exercising. But what if we didn't have the computer? The possability of research, etc. Would be much more difficult. For example: computers help us learn about almost anything quickly and easily. this could help make work for school or jobs less stressful. Also, a computer can be accessed right in your name, so no travel is required. The computer has programs that are used to prepare articles, essays, slide shows and brochures for presentation, as well. If we didn't have a computer, research would be much more of a struggle and could require travel. Computers are one of the most common ways to communicate with friends and family. Websits and e-mail helps you keep intouch with anyone around the world. You can write e-mails, access live chat or even webcam. E-mailing is just like mailing a letter except it is dilivered instantly and doesn't cost anything. There is also no risk of anyone reading your mail. Live chat iswhen you chat over text on the computer. Webcam is face to face interacting which givs off the effect of talking in person: @CAPS1 benefit is that communicates over the computer doesnt cost a thing. Lastly, computers provide games for your personal entertainment, which helps kill boredom. The computer also helps improve hand-eye coordination, along with staying orginized @CAPS2, pictures, videos and more can be placed in files and saved on the computer making it easy for you to open them at @CAPS1 time. Computers @MONTH1 take away from some activities but think of how much harder and more stressful things will be without it. I think that the computer has a good effect on people as well as it being a helpful piece of technology.",9
1205,"I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The three reasons I think this, is because computers enhance our hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find out information about a certain topic. They also allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. Computers, in fact, increase our hand-eye coordination. The usage of both the screen and the keyboard allow us to look only at tha sceen while typing on the keyboard. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill to have when excersising by playing sports or working out, which is also important and very good for our bodies. If you want in to apply for a job in, for example, an office, and you started stumbling and acting clumsy, then you @MONTH1 be looked at differently if you were organized and knew what your doing. This is why hand-eye coordination is important to people. Computers also have the amazing ability to search the world wide web. This gives us the ability to make millions of searches for any given topic. For example, In fifth grade I did a research project on @LOCATION2. Without all the useful information I found on the computer. I would have never been able to learn evrything I did. As most of the world already knows, there was a devestating earthquake in the small country of @LOCATION4. Computers was one of the ways that helped spread the word and get everyone to start helping and sending supplies and food to the victims. Also, if a family is thinking about going somewhere for a vacation, they can take care of most of the help on the computer. They could buy flight tickets, book a room at the hotel, and even get a rental car for when they land. This is what my family did on our vacation to @LOCATION1 and everything turned out perfectly all thanks to the computer and being able to do everything online. This is how the computer can help you research any topic. Lastly, you can use the computer to communicate with people that live far away and you rareley ever see. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION3, so I use video chat to talk to them since I only get the chance to see them one every two or three years. Also when my dad goes on buisness trips to other states or even something out of the country, we use instant messaging or video chat to keep in touch. Lastly, if you have friends or family who are fighting for america in @LOCATION5 right now, you can also use a video chat to communicate with them. So these are all my reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They help with hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find information on any topic through the internet, and lastly, the allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. These are my reasons and I hope you agree with me that computers have a positive effect on people today.",10
1206,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on computers is that I think they are the most helpful thing in our society and it benefits us greatly. Lets say if I wanted to see what across the world looks like, or even what the surface of the moon, mars, venus, jupiter, ect. I could just go onto a computer open or download a program a there it is. Computers also help people express there creativity by here a program that aloose you to draw or biuld. I bet the even help young children became smarter by biulding things on the computer. Another things computers do is open lots of jobs and in a bad econimy people need all the help they can get. With a computer you can keep people alive and bretheing you can find broken bones or tomors, you can biuld briges, homes by making blue prints. The last thing computers help us do is the most importen and that is helps people learn. By making simulation of the titanic a space ships or the floor. They help find information even if its about people you can see people on a computer with a camra for or save a life by fing were they crased on there plane or. Thats why computers are the most helpful thing we have @DATE1 and we should keep learning and progressing to make us more advance and smarter.",8
1207,"Dear local news paper I believe the computer has a positive effect on people. It helps students with projects, helps people learn about other places, @CAPS1 it helps you find information on something you didn't know. @NUM1 precent of all teachers give out computer projects. Most reading teacher will have you read a book and then type a essay or a review about your book. Most teacher prefer the essay typed and not written. By the teacher giving that assignment he/she is giving the student the ability to explore out side of always writing. And I believe other students would agree with me, @CAPS2 better to type the essay than to write it! Is there a place out there that you really want to know more about, that you hope to someday visit? Well you can always use the computer to find out more about the place. You can use the computer to learn when is the best times to visit that place. @CAPS1 if you just heard on the news about a tradjic accident like the eartquake over in @LOCATION1, and you want to keep in touch on what is happening in that place you can use the computer. The computer will keep you updated on what is happening there everyday. Im sure almost every person has read a book and came accross a word they did not know or a student had spelling words that they didn't know what the words meant. Well you can use the computer to look up the words.The computer will give you the full deffinition and how to pronance the word. Computers @CAPS1 will help you find any information you @MONTH1 need, ""AND @CAPS3!"" In conclusion computers aren't just a thing that kids play on all day it helps you with many things like getting your work done, finding out about places, and finding out information about things you need to know, ""And @CAPS3!""",8
1208,"About @PERCENT1 of the world today, use computers. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family and frinds, exercise your brain, and there is time to enjoy nature. Have you ever heard of a email? Well it's a contacting source you can use to contact family and friends. Also there are other sources you can use to conact family and friends. For example, facebook, myspace, and twitter. Even though you're on the computer, you can still do this, you don't always have to call them. I remember a time when I called my aunt from my cell phone, and it wasted my minutes. Something simple as this could've been done over an email. So computers do have a good point to it. Do you know online you can exercise your brain? You can do this by learning new information you haven't learned before. For instance, if my sister needed help with science, she could go online, and learn more information about it. Some experts are thinking that it's too much time on the computer, but it can be very useful to others, by helping them gain knowledge. Computers can even help get online, tutoring, so you can exercise your brain there also. Do you know you can enjoy nature anytime? About @PERCENT2 of our world enjoys nature. Don't you think it can wait until later? Also some people don't like the different seasons and might want to stay in their homes. For example, when it snows. I think nature is good, but I don't think others want to be out as much. Also I know we are apart of nature, and nature is part of our society, but the seasons change and it's lots od bad weather. In conclusion, the computer has some good sources. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family exercise your brain and there time to nature.",8
1209,"I am so happy, I just finished my school report on @PERSON1 and I didn't even need to leave my house. I was able to talk with my classmate and ask her questions online. I also managed to get all the information just from my computer. I also learned how to row a boat, to show my class how @LOCATION1 crossed the @CAPS1 river, I learned that by taking on online course. This is one situation why computers have fantastic effects on people in everyday situations. Local research show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 planning their vocation use the internet. The reason these citizens use internet is to get the information about the hotel and vacation cite. That is one way that makes computers helpful and positive devices, beacuse it makes it easier for busy @CAPS2 to get ready for a trip by looking at pictures of the hotel online and getting all the info they need. Doctor @PERSON2 of @CAPS4 university says ""computers now offer programs that allow busy @CAPS2 to learn a new skill, @PERCENT2 of @CAPS2 currently use this software. ""@CAPS7 everyday @CAPS2 don't have time to go out a join a group or class to learn new skills. That is why computers are so helpful and people just love them. Instead of leaving home they can be cooking, doing yoga, or speaking a new language all from their computer at home. That is another reason why computers are useful in vey positive ways. Imagine forgetting your homework at school and not be able to an A in that class. Well because of computers forgetful students can talk to a classmate online and get the homework and do it. Or they could even use the internet to go to that school website and find the homework and print it out. Many students around the country forget homework once in a while, because of helpful computers they can fix their problems easily. Let's recap, students or adults can get information off the internet for projects or even vacations. Busy @CAPS2 who don't have time to leave their house can take a class or learn a new skill right on the computer. Anyone can use the internet to talk or chat online to get school work or to long distance friends. That is why the effects on computers to people are nothing but positive. Now what can you do? It is important that computers stay in our lives, they are helpful and we have learned to live with them, which is why they must stay. This benefits you because newspaper houses are organized by computers and it keeps you business running.",9
1210,"Dear @CAPS1 of my local news paper: @CAPS2 you believe this garbage that the so called expert are saying about computers? I sure hope you don't! They are saying that computers are health risks because to many people are on them and not exercising, well if you risk me the users should know when to stop. And well when it comes to interacting with family the parents should set limits. Also computers are very convient, if you need information on a topic right away. So there far I think computers are not the one's at, in this perdevment. Exercising is somthing a perosn should have the ambition to do. @MONTH1 people don't have this they spend their day on the computer. they claim its not their faut. the computer is a you to play it. I read just last week that someone actolly told her press they it is not fault her over weight. Thats ! So the only person at full. for not getting the the gamer. As us family interaction goes, all up to the parents the use the parents are in control over they child and if they are that their kid doesn't spend enough time. The operator should have the will power to know when enough is enough and lay down the and set limits!. If we didn't have computers at home it would be a. Kids relie on computer them quick, accurate information. With not them the parents should their child to and from the library, and the time. And lets not forget the internet easy. So in conclusion computers are the way to go they are not the cause or however luck of exrcising at fault. Its not the computers fault familys. And they are just so convenit so clearly computer are good to have! I truly hope by the letter you agree with my oppinion.",8
1211,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion computers are wonderfull to the society in many ways. They can keep memories we cant keep forever like @CAPS3, @CAPS1's, and type letters. Computers also can give you dieting tips and advice from live locals. But, important of all of it, family that you miss can talk to you for hours without a phone bill. To begin, computer can give you @CAPS2 tips on things you didn't know, so it can also be a learning center. For example: your extremely stresed out because you have a huge paper to do but have no facts, there are a millions websites you could go to find your answers on. The next day you get your paper back and theres a A stamped right across it. Another @CAPS2 thing about computers is that you can talk to your family members all the way in a different city, town, state, or even content! you @MONTH1 miss them alot but you can always see them to them or type to them to let that sad feelings melt away for a little bit. Every @NUM1 in @NUM2 americans say missing or not seeing a family member is like letting a little piece of your heart fall off. Everybody knows what its like to have a memory that you could never forget:  but what about those little memories that @CAPS3, websites, and written work seems to slip away from the brain. Computers save all of that so the ""I know its to its like to loose its like a little part of life that you have lived walks always"" exclaims @PERSON1 who could This is exactly why computer in many ways.

1212,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 that use computers is a good thing. I state this because the web has many things to do. For example, facebook, twitter, and myspace are all social sites. Also there are video sites such as youtube. Plus @CAPS1 learn how to type fast. Social network sites are good for @CAPS1. Teens got to talk to each other, make new friends, and post what they want. For example, twitter you can post tweets, facebook you can join groups, and become a fan of something or someone, and myspace you can send messages. TEENS relieve a lot of stress on the web. Videos are great when your bored. Type in youtube and get a good laugh or two. Teens that go on youtube become more social. For example, teens can learn the new dance. Plus on video sites there are comedy. Comedy helps daily life. @CAPS2 helps life if you work in a office or a trademark. Teens learn to type to make life easier. For example @CAPS2 fast is like texting. @CAPS2 is like writing a letter electronically. So get to @CAPS2. Ok so computers do help life in teen years. Basically it is @CAPS3 somewhat.

More and more people log on to a computer everyday, and although the people willing to change and believe in new advances in technology out on a strong argument of why computers are and there are still some that can only see the negative. I strongly support computers and believe they have a lot of potential. Computers make the work even smaler. They allow to talk to people thousands at miles away man instant. Also, you can reconnect with friends that you can't see anymore. For example, I used to go to an awesome @DATE1 camp and I made same of my best friends there.

I frequent my computer almost every hour, so I made a system to ensure I got exercise. Every time I walk the room my computer is hooked, I grab the pull up right and do @NUM1. I only thought of this system @NUM2 months ago and I have already my own muscles, and I can do @NUM3 pull as at a time but when I started I struggled to do @NUM2. If not for the amazing of computers that me back, I would still do exercise, only to after about a week. Computers give easy to the internet, which has so much information it is.

Ive gone countless time to find for an essay with the limited textbooks have just isnt what you need. My country project @DATE1 year couldn't have had more than @CAPS5 pleces of information from a book! It also makes a great teacher of about any subject as well. As a matter of fact, my language arts teacher told us a story about how ever the @DATE1 a ball that has never done any sort of water sports before, spent @NUM2 weeks watching videos on youtube about how to waterski, and on his first dearly doing tricks. These are only a few of the reasons I think computers are great. They keep friend ships close, give you a reason to exercise, and can teach you anything!

1214,"Dear editor: More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that that benefits society. As editor of the newspaper, you have the power to inform people about situations. In my opinion computers are desperately in need because of the following: the computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places, people, and weather, they allow people to talk online with others, and many jobs use computers. Do you want a more economically advanced state? First of all the computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places, people, and the weather. I have an uncle named @PERSON1, that has @NUM1 little girls. Every day in the morning before school @PERSON1 checks on the weather, on his computer to make sure it is safe to go school. However, one day forgot to check the weather on his computer and took his kids to school. Little did he know the roads were extremely icey. Sadly @PERSON1 and his daughters got in a car accident and two of girls broke a few bones. As you can see, the weather the computer world have saved him a trip to the emergency room. Next, the computer allows you to talk online with other people. Dr. @DR1 from @CAPS1 states says that, ""chating online with others (@CAPS2) is the best way to stay in touch with others from your old school, camp and many other places."" I highly agree because adults can stay in touch with freinds from middle school. Also @PERCENT1 of students say that they usually go online to study or get the pages for homework. I believe that chating online to study for tests is a fantastic idea because it will help the students to get better grades. Some parents say that that is a way to study and a waste of time. However teachers say that ever since @CAPS2 was invented the students grades were skyrocketing. Finally most jobs today use computers. For example my dad works for @ORGANIZATION1 and the computer helps him communicate with clients all over the world. Also the chat can translate the language, thus it makes it much easier than talking on the phone. Also the teachers use computers to put grades from students in. This makes the teachers job much easier because it averages all of the grades. The computer revolutionise the jobs of people. In conclusion the computer has a positive effect on people because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places, people, and weather, allows people to talk online with other people, and many jobs use computers. I urge you to support me by writing a positive article on computer and how the help the society. Please take my idea into consideration.",9
1215,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing a letter to you saying that I think its a bad idea for you to make kids stay off of computers because it does teach kids something, it good to do homework on and you can relax when your on it. Well computers teaches kids a lof of things like hand-eye coordination. If kids want to work with computers when there older they can learn new to work with it. There is also websites that can show you how to move yor hands when using a computer. Well when kids come from school always have homework, @CAPS2 you need to do it on the comptuer so if you couldn't use computers it would be hard for kids to do there homework. So when they go to school and the class tells the teacher they dont have computers what are they going to do. So when I get out of school and I had a very long day. I go home do my homework and go on the computer and listen to music to relax. If you guy were to take computers away every one would be grumpy all the time. That is why I think you should keep computers and not exercise as much. We get enuf of that in school carry all these heveay books around.",6
1216,"Dear @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 if I was with or aganist people using computers. But I thought about it I decided that i was aganist using computers. For the same reasons, safety stop education, sites that are not appropriate to see. I know many people @MONTH1 think how come using a computer is not safe. Well eventhough you are not talking to someone in person and only on the computer what you do over computer is not safe. The reason why is because most of the time there would be thats thirty and we be like @NUM1, @DATE1 and I use those ages because kids are age be the man one on @CAPS2 myspace, but he can be like thirty and we be like @NUM1 - @DATE1 and us not knowing he comes on myspace or @CAPS2 put another picture up there of young did we start thinking to him meet up and something had happend. For example my friend who was on myspace was talking to a fourty-one year old and then they met up but she did not know his age and she was rapped. Not everybody is true over the computer. Education is very important even for adults and children. Bieng on the computer is not going to bring are education up is going to brings down. The reason why this is most @DATE1 threw @NUM3 come home from school put there hookbag down eat and then do straight on myspace, @CAPS2, @CAPS5 instead of studying, reading, doing their homework. Eventhough those websites do help you learn but only about for myspace, read messages on @CAPS2 look at people comments on @CAPS5. Like for example I would go and instead of me learning new I am bieng and learning new information. Learning brings achievement, a computer brings not succeeding. There is not much I can say about sites thats not appropriate all I can say is watch what you on and see on myspace cause you might just but into something you not suppose to such as raped that went on. Be careful.",9
1217,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1. I've just been informed about how people view computers and the effects of them. In my opinion, I find computers to be a very negative influence on yound kids, teens, and adults. Many harmful awarenesses come along with having one. For one thing, people being so hypnotized in this electronical device are finding lesser time to excercise and take care of themselves. Also to, the only nature they're experiencing is pictures online and not enjoying the full beuty of what we have left of out earth. Another negative outcome is that they start becoming more and more distant from their loved ones. What happened to our society? Why can't we think on our own anymore? I truely, strongly hope that what i'm saying will change the minds of some people. Thank you very much. Exercise is a very key aspect in anyone's life. Especially growing kids and teens. On the computer what exercise benefits are you getting? Stronger fingers? A higher chance of syndrome @CAPS10. ""@CAPS2 @PERCENT1 of kids having @CAPS7 problems like obesity have access to the internet"", accoding to @PERSON2 of the, ""@CAPS3 feel right with @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"" in hunington beach, @LOCATION1. When basically, your giveing youself to the computers, you @MONTH1 not have any thoughts at all of staying fir. Instead on some chips while typing. @CAPS4 @CAPS7 BENEFITS @CAPS8 that game help? With global warming by ourside, what you saw yesterday @MONTH1 not be there today. Breathing in some fresh, natural air can really calm a stressed child out. What ever happened to playing an endless scoth with side walk chalk and fresh? or tag or just running around? Is it not cool anymore? Yah, not cool to take care of yourself. Inspire yourself by writing poems about how you feel or draw a screnary. Now a days, instead of @CAPS10 climing a tree, were climbing our mouse arrow to the next website. There's so much that we all take for granted, that one day when you look back on ti all, youre going to really miss those @DATE1 days. Family time is so critical in anyone's life. Without a family, you're nothing. When did game night or family time disapear? Just because we're in a society that says computers are completely normal everyday thing in a house, doesn't mean you family and friends aren't a main priority to you anymore. If you want to hangout a friend's house, dont email about it, walk @CAPS2 there and get the full affect since when does a computer a family? Never. If we got out of a fake reality, @CAPS10 there wouldn't be negativity in our life. @CAPS10 you can regain a true life back with them. @CAPS10 you'd think more clearer just @CAPS10. Whats makes a computer any better than life? Nothing ask yourself that. So inconclusive, I strongly believe that with this in you lives we've actually get dumber. There's more negative than positives in having a computer. Sure you could quickly send them a message or like @CAPS9, but is it ever bad to do the good old fashion calling? Or sendin letter? I say again, thank you for taking out your time to read this. @CAPS10 i changed you, @CAPS10 not. Whatever you do, think about the next time you're online and see what happends. ",10
1218,"Dear local newspaper, I think spending to much time on a computer is bad. One of my reasons are Exercising. People should be outside jogging or working out and enjoying nature. Also should be socializing with friend. Now my second reason is spending time with your fromily. Being with your family is important because their fun go out with. Also they're good to socialize with at home or any other place. Sometimes socializing with people on a computer is not good as if with people because socialicing with friends and family is easier than sitting on a chair typing a bunch of works explaining about the convosation your having. And last my finall reason is being active. People should be active because it's fun and your socialicing with people and playing sports with or . It keeps you and healthy. Also being active can healthen your lungs and heart. For example football keeps your legs strong and built. And basketball keeps you quick and always running. It's good for you because being active gives you a healthier, stronger and in shape body. So their for I think spending a lot of time on a computer is bad.",7
1219,"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to you to inform you that I agree with the followings said on the writing prompt. First, I will be talking about how people  use computer too much. Secondly, I would talk about people who talk online way too much. Lstly, I would say spending to much time on their computers. To start, people that use computers too much. First, people like to go on things such as myspace, secondly people like playing online games. ALstly, some people like to gosep to others online. For example, if you go to soemones house you are always going to see a young kid or a parent online somewhere or playing online gmaes. Also, peopel talk online way too much. First, they go to face book all the time. Secondly, they got ,myspace which you can get your identity stolen. Lastly, kids love to go on myspace it's the smae as myspace. for example, peopel might come to you and say do you have a so and so and sya can I get your eamail address. Certainly, spoending too much time on their computers is bad. first, kids might have problems online and to keep the problem to get worst. Secondly, might be argueing with a friend. Lastly, might nit be active but live playing or going other online websites. So @CAPS1 did you start to agree with why people should get active outside and have fun. In conclusion, this was why I agreed with beign active because being on the computer all day would get your and hard use too being on the computer @NUM1. ",6
1220,In my opinion I think that computers have a good affect on people. I think this because about millions of people use computers everyday! The affects on them are that people get learn things easier. There are millions of a job sites that would have to do with something of learning. About @NUM1 of collage students go online and do challenge. If you were a collage student and did collage online you would: see your family more won't be a hassle to get to collage and would be easier to concentrate being by your self and learning. Also they even make stone which is very popular learning a different language and where you learn this from is on a computer. My second reason is to talk on the . About @NUM2 of our daily! Online phone you and you can also the cool them even more that have you talk to give . I know have a facebook give don't get think it would be a good chore. up free. So in conclusion I think that there good effects on people that use cpu. Also when everyone that uses their cpu they still enjoy the nature talk to thier family . So if you don't have a cpu you get one and will do other fun stuff you like.,8
1221,"Dear, whom @MONTH1 concern; Local Newspaper. I belive you are right. Computers can be helpful, let us chat with people but we don’t exercise. Forget about family and most importantly yor health their vision gets bad, they eat more junk foor and that can lead to bad cholersterol. High blood pressure and even diabities. A computer is very addicting people stay up on it for hours. It will give you bad higiens so I think you should really take a look at this and put this on the Newspaper and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 residents I know it could be very fun and ejoyable but it would be all fun and games until your very sick you @MONTH1 take this as but this is highly serious in many ways. Not being with the people you love not doing any activities you people need to get off that computer and do more in your life for. A computer is like a drug but do it for your family and listen to my point of view so I think all computers should be banned for at least one week to look up on work or school and maybe even your health. This @MONTH1 seem like were overacting on this but we really arent. Do you want population on people having diabetis and other causing affects that can happen to your body increase. Well I think not how would that make you feel. Not good al all so people get of your feet and jogg. Do whateverenjoy time with your family. So just listen to me and stop this badd habbit.",8
1222,"Dear, @CAPS1 paper @CAPS2 The computers we have do benefits our society, because it makes people smarter, it's a way to talk to people who live far from where you live, and it's a great way to do homework if you still in school. Having a computer is a great way to get you smarter.You could go on diffrent websites to help you learn what your stuck on in school. I remember the time I was having trouble in math, so my teacher gave me this website called a @ORGANIZATION1. It goes over on waht you need help on, and you get a live tutor. The computer could teach babies how to talk. It taught my cousin how to talk and he's @NUM1 @NUM1/2 years old. Isn't that amazing on that computers can do. Next I will talk about how computers are a great resource to talk to far away people you @MONTH1 know. When you have computers you could talk to people that live across the @LOCATION1 woudn't you want to talk to somebody long distance without paying extra money on your cell-phone? I remember one time I was talking to my dad cause I had no minuts on my phone and it went great talking to him on the computer. Having a computer is kind of like a bigger cellphone. You could talk to a family or a friend if you or they don't have a phone. Lastly, I will talk about how you could do homework. Having a computer you could do a lot of homework. Last time I was on my computer I had to find out about @PERSON1 for math, so I typed his name and his biography came so I wrote about him. You could use it for all subjects especially language arts you could type up papers and look up diffrent things you had to do in class. Would you want to write a @NUM3 page essay and makin your fingers cramp up just writing no. so you just go on the computer and type it up without cramping your fingers @CAPS3 reconsider your opinion, cause computers can get you smarter, talk far away people and help you with homework.",9
1223,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 opinion is getting out of mind. They're people who are getting addicted to to @CAPS2, such as games, websites, communication and email websites and etc. Therefore, they're people who are just plain addicted to the computer, such as @CAPS3. I know people who are addicted on @CAPS3 because, they get addicted to talking to people, and looking at other people. So they dont cooperate correctly with there school work (so they get bad grades) or they loose connection with family members and friends (so they become lonely and depressed). Then thier only friend is the computer. Also other effects on the computer is if your addicted to a website (in generaal) you can get out of shape, because your not spending enough time excersing, there is already enough people in @LOCATION1 that is obesed and it is already a add on to the problem. I read online than in @LOCATION1 is obesed. So computers are a addiction waiting to happen. Therefore people need to start spending time friends and start excersing and stay away from the computer.",6
1224,"Dear local newspaper editor, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of computers on people is that staying on a computer is not that bad it does not rot you brain like video games. are some good reasons why computers are good and help you. Sometimes computers do help with hand-eye coordination. You use the computer to do homework or to search a a stores etc. Some computers are really slow but not all of the new ones for @DATE1, computers can also help you read better it has little . You could play talk to people like your friends. Listening to music is an easy thing to you could a website that has all songs that you like to listen yo many people use the computer to find jobs and use it to look for ways to eat right and work out paying bills online is easyer than paying them for real. The computer is easy way to pay and you should agree with @CAPS1 opinion.",6
1225,"Dear leader of the local newspaper, I have heard the strange misconception that computers are ruining our society. I for one, think that this is a terribly made thought. To begin, the internet (provided with most home desktop computers) can teach us a lot about the world around us. Additionally, the whole fact of contacting others around the globe, as well as having a whole fun world to explore, makes computers more enjoyable. Finally, thousands of jobs around the world are either based on or work with computers. Due to this, computers are , without a doubt, beneficial to society. The first reason I need to clearly point out is that the computer holds tons of information that can't be found anywhere else. While books have to be republished as updates occur in the world, anything on the internet can be updated almost instantly, beneficial to students with school projects for subjects like @CAPS1, subsequently, people could actually go to school via online schools and colleges. Whilst regular colleges could cost around thousands of dollars in order to get in, online colleges are much rather cheap, affordable to anyone. Also, due to the high amounts of information online, schools seem to be growing obsolete as computers typically hold all information obtained in a regular school year. Because of this, computers are definately beneficial to society. To build up, the internet provided with computers can bring loads of pleasure to those who use it wisely. Because of the growing population of those who use computers, companies tend to make computer shoes, which usually attracts viewers by the thousands each day. This makes television seem obsolete as well. Another major thing is that software comes out for the computer almost everyday, allowing many things to be done by users. Software typically includes games, movies, and music. Finally, since staying in touch with others is a good thing, chatting with others across the globe is very easy and durable, allowing distant relatives to come in contact with you via various chat programs. Due to this, computers can bring loads of fun to users, and are thus beneficial to society. Lastly, due to the rising demand of computers, companies typically rely on computers for jobs. Since the internet population is growing, companies allow people to fill out applications and send in resumes in order to apply for a job in said company. Also, some jobs can only be done while online or using a computer. Many jobs these days, typically banks, rely on using the internet most of the time, and some actually are based in the internet. Because of this, workers can finish the job easily in one place, instead of having to around and going to a boring looking building to do a boring job. With this reason, why doesn't anyone else see why computers are beneficial to society? With all of these reasons, I hope you see why computers are beneficial to society. Education just become a whole lot easier thanks to the internet. If education is not what you seek, you can then use the internet to have fun when you are bored. Finally, jobs can be completed even easier, and makes workers more responsible. So, leader of the paper, do you really, along with everyone else, think that computers are a waste of time in life?",11
1226,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are a great way to learn about the world and its people. Computers can teach people about things that are forien to them. Computers keep people intouch, all over the world. Computers also come in handy when something needs to be looked up right away. Computers are very helpful when it comes to learning. They can teach you things that most books cant, such as hand eye coordination also about the current populations of countrys and cities. Also, computers gives you the opportunity to see pictures of places and people that you couldn't find in books or photo albums or newspapers. They also help in schools when projects are asigned. Kids can use computers to find information they need quickly. Kids can also use computer to wright essays or print pictures for projects. Computers are definately a staple for learning & education. Computers are also great for comunication. People can chat with one another on networking sites such as @CAPS1, facebook, myspace, and twitter. On these sites people can send messages to their friends a leaking them of something or chat with their friends to see whats to keep in touch with family and friends, on the computer. Family members can e-mail each other to inform them of an event or news. I have actually had an experience with e-mail that was very helpful my family members and I had been speaking of traveling to block island and two days before we were going to leave we recived on email from the owner of the house we were going to stay at stating that all phone lines were down and part of the house was ruined due to a storm. If it werent for computers we would have been in a sick situation. Computers also come in handy in times of need or confusion. People can check their local weather forecasts to see of the weather will effect their plans. Also if someone doesn't know where a house or store is located they cab quickly look it up on the computer. Finaly if something is unavailable on a store people can shop for it online and can buy what they need, and have it shaped to their door step. Computers have helped this country grow and prosper. Why bother to go aginst them when they benafit society so much? Computers are helping the world become a better educated, connected, and informed world.",10
1227,"Dear Local Newspaper,… I believe that computers have a negitive affect on people today. I believe this because computers cause people to be less active, most people would want to be at home on their computers then out side doing activities. I also belive computers restrict people who talk through it to show emotion. People should be out with each other when they talk not talking throught a machien. Finally if people were not on the computer as much they would bring down the obesity rate of the contry if everyone just stoped using technology for a while and wen outside. Every day at least once or twice or somtimes even more people use the computer for hours on end. People today have so many options of things to do on the internet: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, ooVoo, and alot more. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say they ""need"" to check these everyday but they really dont. What they do ""need"" to do is to stop using computers as much and go out side! Furthermore, people all around the world communicate thought the computer. I talk to my friends all the time thought the computer"" says @PERSON1, ""@CAPS3 the easiest way"". Now it @MONTH1 be the easiest way but @CAPS3 also the most boring, I mean really do you want to talk like a robot or with emotion like a person? Computers dont give you the chance to show emotion, this means people need to go out, hans out, and mabye even call each other to talk. At least you getting up to get the phone. Finally, @CAPS4 is one of the most obese places in the whole world. People are sitting on the computer everyday, eating, and not moving at all and gaining weight. Do you really want to be a known as the ""fat country""? I dont think so. People should restrict computer usage among themselves to a of an hour even less if you can. To restate, I beleve that computers have a negitive affect on todays people aroung the world. Computers cause people to be less active. less emotionn in a conversation, and cause people to be obese. So please help me fight to put more people outside and make people more active, sounds like a pretty good cause huh?",9
1228,"Dear @PERSON4, I strongly believe that use of computer is beneficial to the community. One reason I feel this way is that computers can improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. These computers provide access to games helpful in @ORGANIZATION2 training. In fact, @ORGANIZATION2, in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, just began using these games as part of their training this @DATE1. Instructors report that @ORGANIZATION2 skills in trainees and students are far better than in years past. Additionally, computer games can improve reflexes. Two years ago, a man named @PERSON3, @NUM1 years old, fell onto the train tracks just as a train was coming by. Through extra-ordinary reflexes he managed to leap out of the way, saving his life. When asked how he did @CAPS5, he said he had been playing computer games since he was @NUM2 years old. These games also make you more intelligent. The @ORGANIZATION1's @DATE2 study reports that brains were @PERCENT1 more active after use of computers. The researchers achieved this data by attaching electrolytes to the patient's brain both before and after using the computer. @CAPS5 is for these reasons that computers improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. Another reason for why computers are beneficial is that they allow you to talk online. They even allow you to communicate with your family who live far away, strengthening your relationships. I recently got back in touch with my cousin who moved to @LOCATION3. Letters were too expensive and took too long, but email and skype provide us with a great alternative. These computers also improve social skills. @PERSON1, resident here in town, says, ""I love using computers because I can talk to my friends whenever I want, and I feel like @CAPS5 really helps us communicate."" Who wouldn't love a machine that provides a service like that? These computers can even improve your mood. In a test done by @ORGANIZATION3 in @DATE3, @NUM3 people were put in seperate rooms with personal computers for @NUM4 hour. Afterwards, @PERCENT2 said they felt an improvement in their mood. Computers are great because they allow you to talk online. Finally, computers allow you to learn about other places. Virtual tours are becoming more and more common today. Infact, at @CAPS2.org, you can take virtual tours of over @NUM5 different countries, including @LOCATION5, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION6. You can also learn about other cultures and their traditions through online videos at youtube.com and articles at wikipedia.org, the free encyclopedia. You can even learn new recipes. Celebrity chef extraordinare @PERSON2 not only posts all her recipes online at mstewart.com, but she even finds some of them! In a recent interview by @CAPS3 magazine, when asked where she's found some of her best recipes, including her famous @CAPS4 chocolate cake, @PERSON2 admits she found most of them online, saying, ""@CAPS5's a powerful resource that more people should use. Al @CAPS6 currently owns the world's best cookbook!"" @CAPS5 is because of this that computers allow you to learn about other place. Thank you for your time, and I hope you take what I have said into consideration. @CAPS5 is for all of these reasons I strongly believe computers are beneficial to the community.",12
1229,"The computer is a great achivement of man. It is very useful for finding information fast, and has many other capabilities. Even though computers are every useful tool in the modern world. It has negatively afect to people. People aren't getting enough exercise because they are always on the computer. Along with that they are being socialy active. The lost and probably most negative effect is the exesive amount of freedom people get on the internet. Exercise is probably are one of the most important thing to live along and healthy life. People should be atleast taking along walk everyday. If people are sitting infront of a all day there will be much moreover people. People shold be for healthy life style, not with computers around every corner. People are also losing the ability to interact. Life is becoming dull. Every one is either texting someone. The biggest surprise is that there is online dating. This is horrible because you might be dating some crazy person. If someone think there inlove and when the cople meets the dont know how to interact, then there is a real problems. Even when you are just on the computer. You could use that time to socialize with friends and family. Last is the emerce amount of freedom that any are has with computers. There are lots of bullies people who want to sell you stuff, and people who want your personal info. Many kids sign up for something like facebook, but they're not cairful. They put staff like there adress and don't pay attention who how is sending them friend request. Computers have way to much negative effectson people. It would be great if some how the system could be improved, and people need to be more responsible. People should wont to get out and interact. Take a walk. Just dont let computers control your life.",8
1230,"Dear newspaper, Some people say that computers don't benefit society. But I think diferent. Computers benefit society more than you would think. They help people learn and makes work much easier. They help prevent acidents, and the save lives. Computers help people learn and make work easier its a fact. You can type you can plan your sedual. You can make a presantation or check your email. All of those things make work easier. And there are tons of more things you can do. As I said before they can help people learn. You can learn trillions of things on the internet. You can learn about everything on the internet and it is quite amazing. You could get a medical degree on the internet. Makeing work easyer or helping people learn aren't the extent of the computers abilitys. Computers can prevent acidents in anything that moves. For example cars millions on the road today and some can practily drive them selves. And that is all done with computers. Also planes, the only reason the piolot is there is in case something gose wrong. Same thing with trains. Furthermore @CAPS1 are completly computerized all the humans do is tell the computer what they want it to do. Almost everything that moves within its own power has been computerized at some point in time. And that makes the world safer for every one. Finaly computers save lives, its completly true. In hospitals without computers people would be dieing every day. They use them to keep records, record vital signs and asist with surgery. In surgery computers help by only haveing to make a tiny insision and can be much more acurate than human sergons which save lives. Also computers can mak sure that a operating room is completly sterial which reduces risks of infection. As you can see computers benifit society a lot more than you might think. They help people learn and make work easyer. They prevent acidents with which reduces people going to the hospital. And if they do go they are almost garenteed a survival. So what do you think about them now.",9
1231,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that the aspect of computers and their influence on people has been brought up. I personally feel that computers are a marvelous tool to help mankind advance. They provide infinite knowledge, entertainment, and dispite what the opposing side says, allow social interactions for those who don'@CAPS4 like to meet face to face. My first reason why computers benefit humans rather than hurt them is the knowledge they provide. Computers give access to the internet, which has near-infinitr amounte of knowledge stored inside @CAPS2. With a simple click of a button you have thousands of websites dedicated to answering your question. They can provide tons of information normally unobtainable. Take for example two students, one with a conputer are without. Both are given an assignment to write a report on a famous person. The one with the computer logs any searches for the reason, and in seconds has enough information to write numerous reports. He aces the reports, and continues to use this method. He graduates top of the class, goes through college and gets a high paying job right out of the gate. The one without the computer needs to go to the library. After spending an hour walking there, he learns that all the books on thet person are checkedout. He finds a book with a short bit on that person and writes about thet. He fails the test, fails the grade, drops out of school, and works ot a @ORGANIZATION1 his entire life. See how much of a different a computer can make? My second reason is that, even though computers are often thought of as destroying @CAPS2, @CAPS3 can build social lives. Millions of people use the internet everytime and there are places on the web built so that they can talk. Some people @MONTH1 that this is and leads to , but anyone who has basic knowledge knows not to information. The internet also has and those still unsure can use specially sites to talk to people they know in life onlt. @CAPS2 also allows for people to ask questions. Having differently finding specific information? Just post a question on a public site use people with first hand experience will answer @CAPS2 with all the detail you need and more. Say that somebody wants to be a writter, but needs to know how the writing system works, how to set a job in @CAPS2, what the pay is, etc. He searches the internet, but only finds job applications and college ady so he asks the questions on a public site. Someone who has been a write their whole lives checks out the question, and answers @CAPS2 ion great detail. Problem solvely and @CAPS2 someone on the internet. My final reason is the entertainment computer provide you can play games, watch movies or homemade videos, and even talk to friends. Computers allow you to access thousands of free services to benefit you. Sitting in your room, bored? Why not play a game on your computer. Tired of @CAPS4.V movies? Go to the computer and have an infinite wideo library? Go to the computer and have an infinite video library at your dipasle. Lonely? Go to a social website and strike up a conversation. @CAPS2 has infinite entertainment, right at your finger-tips. In conclusion, I believe that compkuters is no limit to what you can do with a computer, as long as you have the imagination. Computers were invented to benefit mankind, not hurting and they are doing a great job.",10
1232,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, People are using computers all the time but computers help us all the time in positive ways. Computers help us look @CAPS3 information, talk to people around the world, and buy stuff from our house. In a technilogical age the possibilities are endless.

Doctors even say that talking to some one backhome give a soldier more will power to survive. Everyone goes to school, so that means everyone has projecets. During projects a kid want know everything so a good way to get information is to goes on the computer and search what your looking @CAPS3. The computer has trillions of websites that people You can anything fromhow man started to the. Be a sport person and @CAPS2 one likes to get @CAPS3 free online, @CAPS1 are websites like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 so you can. If you like that song go on @CAPS7, @ORGANIZATION2, lymewire, of any other store to and download to your @NUM1 or @CAPS8. In this time I hope you have learned more about the computer and have changed your mind. Even though @CAPS1 are bad people and bad websites doesn't mean the computers bad.",8

1234,"Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion is yes people are on the computer to much. I have @NUM1 good reason why I think people are on the computer a lot. @CAPS1 first reason is people are losing time. Second not that much engry. Third you just spending your life on the computer keep on reading why I don't agree that it befits society to people. People losing time to have fun. They do have any time for friends family, pets, and scuh more. It mostly adicaution to go on website like facebook, myspace, @CAPS2, and such more people just need to get off the computer and have fun outside. Mostly people dont really get that much engry. Some people are always inside they just need engry. Fresh our will help that maybe going to the gym or jog outside for a while. Being inside isnt really good for you. Just being inside just make you kinda gang weight. And then you wouldn't have anytime with your friends, and more only if your inside like always. Fineally you spend all your time at home being computer. And you don't have anytime, engry and such more. YOu spend all your time inside computer cool technology but you don't need to be on it @NUM2. You just have time for friends and family. Now you know @CAPS1 opinion why computers are benfit society. People are losing time and everything. People dont have anymore engry. And your spend all your time on the computer. Bye for now.",7
1235,"Dear local news paper, This paper is going to be about the reason computers are bad. Frist, computers are bad cause people wouldn't have time to enjoy the nature when its nice and warm out. Second reason is cause they won't spend time with there familys at all or there friends and the only time they would get off the computer is to pay the bill and buy a game for the computer. The third reason is that how are going to get a job cause they wouldn't want to get up to look for a job cause there having to much fun intill they cut off the light then he would do dum things to pay is bell se he can start to play again and thats going to make hin do it over and over again. That's why it's bad to have a computer. But now where is people going go in life cause some people love to play games on the computer and some don't that's why some computers are bad for some people. And this is just my opinion there's alot more people might think so to. And thank you for having time to read this.",6
1236,"Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that technologies for kids and adults to use computers. I strongly believe that people have a bad affection people because you addicted, you spend less time with your family and friends. Finally, you spend less time excercising and doing great opportunities for your self. Clearly, i think that lettng students and adults use computers will take over their mind and make them addicted to the computer. This very bad because when your addicted to something, you can go back. This means you will have time for anything. For example, they micht forget what life is about and what was around for us to live in. Addiction is hard to get over , so don;t live your life in a box and play on nonsens live your life to the fullest. Over all, addiction in everything, including computers and a horrible . Without a doubt, spending too much time on computers will rott your brain and make you lazy. Meaning that the less you excersise, the less active you are. This problem is specially for teens. Teens have computer every week. cell phones, ipods, and many more. Alot of teens get cranky and the become node and neisty to their parents because they are testing to. As people dont excercise and move around alot, cause severe consequences like obesity and cancer. Obesity usually happens when you eating food, but it can also ahppen by not eating and not exercising. People that arent moving become lazy and have no desire to do anything which will an effect . Overall computers cause people to do the excercise and less active which will cause . Lastly, Computers make people spend less and less time with their family, and treat their computer as if the computers are . In everyday life , teens on their cell phones , their computers listening to , music . these electronics are causing. If this goes on alot of teens will loose the people they. Computers are a waste of time because they can make you. because they have affect on people who use computers and other electronics. ",10
1237,"Do you spend all or most of your freetime sitting at your computer? People are spending too much time on computers. Obesity is a growing problem in today's society, people need to interact with eachother, and we need to get some fresh air. Computer are ruining these things for people. Unplug yourself from your computer. More and more people are becoming obese. This is do to spending too much time sitting down in front of computers. There is absolutely no exercise involved with being on your computer. People need to get outside and go jogging, play games or ride their bikes. Cutting back on computer time would cut back on the obesity problem in our society. Top scientists and researchers say that it is extremely important for people to interact with others face to face. To our whole life, we will have to interact and socialize with others. If you don't develop these skills, you won't be happy where you end up. Talking to people over the computer is nowhere near close to talking to someone face to face. Get out and get some fresh air. Go experience nature. Bring out on the beach, hiking in the woods or even just sitting on the swing in your backyard can be the most. Fresh air clear your mind. Time says that kids who spend time outside receive better grades than they would if they were inside on the computer. People need to releave stress so go outside. Click turn off your computers and get out of your chair. Go get some exercise, go interact with friendsand family, or even just go outside and get some fresh air while relaxing. People are wasting too much time on their computers and it's flushing our society down the toilet, so just turn off your computer.",8
1238,"Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers are effecting the lives of many people. More and more people keep getting sucked into the amazing things that computers can do and forget all about the other more important things in life. People should be exercising, and hanging out with friends and family, computers dont even teach you that much if you really think about it. People don't even realize that computers can take away very important things in life. Fore istance, people aren't getting nearly as much exercise as they need. In this generation, more kids are overweight and obese that any other other generation. People get so caught up in what they are doing on the computer that they forget to exercise each day, or at least every other day. Computers just add to list of excuses not to do anything. People already spend way to much time watching t.v. It rots your brain and studies acually show that people are less aware and less connected to the world and the people around them. Computers are the same as t.v.'s, you say that your just going to be an for a minute and then next thing you know @NUM1 hours have already gone by. Computers @MONTH1 be exercising your brain, but they're not exercing you and that's what really counts. Even if you were on the computer doing research for a school project, the computer still wouldn't help you. Most people don't have the time to run out to the library to get the books that they need, so they just resort to the computer. That isn't the smartest idea because half of the websites that you click on or go to don't even have the correct information. You might look at it and read it, and even if it sounds good to you, that doesn't mean that it's right. Next thing you know, you have a @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 on an assignment that the thought you aced. On top of getting false information, most people don't even know where to look to get the information that they're looking for. People just type what they are looking for into the google search box and press enter. Then they just click on the first link that they see and use the information that is right on the page. Then all of these different windows are popping up and you are far from where you were. People then just give up and start goofing off on the computer because they don't feel like trying to get back to that page. If people just went to the library and did research the old fashion way, then they would stop to notice all the things in life that they are missing out on. People should be focusing on family and friends rather than playing games on the computer. Sure you can talk to people on the computer but you can't bond with them or really see what they are feeling. It's better to invite them over and have some fun playing board games or just talking in person for a change. Even if your spending time with your family or friends you're probebly thinking about the computer the whole time that they are there, so go out and do something for change, a little fresh air wouldn't kill you. You should go to an amusement park, ride some rides with your cousins, do something that will keep your mind off the computer. People don't realize it, but after spending so much time with your family, rather than your computer, you will acually notice what you have been missing out on for so long. As you can see, computers aren't helping anyone. It's either not exercing, getting false information, or not spending time with your own family! Seems to me that having computers around isn't everything that it's cracked up to be.",9
1239,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you agree that people could use computers all the time and never get off. Well I don't. Think about all the negative things that could happen. Like spending less time with your family, getting addicted, and unhealthy. People who spend all there time on the computer forget that there family is there. For instance, I remember when I was little and I was on the computer and I forgot that i had family members with me, so I missed out on all the fun things like going to the mall or park. Certainly, playing on the computer is fun but woudn't you want to give some attention to your family. Almost @PERCENT1 of people in other countries be very lonely because all they @CAPS1 is play on the computer and forget about other people. You woudn't want to be like these other people right? I never thought playing on computers could be addicted. Lots of people in other countries can't last a day without playing on computers. Some say almost all the people that play on computers all day, day to night have died because they bairly eat, sleep, or use the bathroom. Imagine you life being ended because of addiction on computers. I remember when my friend told me, ""don't be on the computer to long you might die,"" and I thought it was a joke. So think about going on the computer all day and night. Not but not least, some people aren't treating their body properly. For example, some people playing on compters forget about eating, sleeping or walking around. This tends to make people's legs num and make people's stomach hurt alot. Imagine not eating, sleeping and walking around for a day. You woudn't even want to try this. Now is the time to decide, wheither people should be able to play on the computer day to night. Also all the negative things that can happen like spending less time with family members, getting addicted, and being unhealthy. So get right up and decide.",9
1240,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In the @DATE1 the world has changed so much, for the better. Technology has become so advanced, there are new cures for for different diseases. Computers are one of these great benefits. They let you communicate quicker. You can keep up with family members and old friends. You can also talk to different people who live in another state, country, or continent. These a quote that says ""communication is key."" I'll put that into more details in my next paragraph. I remember one time long ago, the only way to communicate was by letters or you would have to walk. Now wih computers with just one email or an instant message. Someone can get your messgae in. By sending a letter it can take a while. Even if you and call some one they @MONTH1 not be home or answer. But you can get emails and instant message ways. It also doesn't cost to send long distnace. Which will be bring yo my next topic. A profressor at @ORGANIZATION2 once said ""Computers are taking time "" But, if you think about it what it's actually doing is reconnecting with family members and old friends. For example, you @MONTH1 move and not be able to see them again. Then, you get a new phone number and forget other people number. If you have a computer you go on this great social networking side called where you look up some old friends name and distant realtives and you find out that it's really them. Than they you to other family members and before you know it you all to other again. Now, I'll bring to you my @DATE1 topic. The world wide web is a big place were peolple from all over the. On the world wide web you can meet some new people who not live in your state, or country. But, you find that you are starting to click when you meet this person they @MONTH1 be of a different rare. Thats ok you can learn new thing about a different cuture. While you two @MONTH1 have something in common you can share other things you like to do which you can try, so you're learning something new while having fun at the same time. Now you'll see it's time you get a computer rather than never have the experience. With a computer you can communcate quicker. You can reconnect with distant relatives and old friends. You can also talk to different people who like you.",8
1241,There are many reasons that computers are a good thing for the world. They let us learn about far away places without us even having to leave our homes. Another reason why computers are so important is we can talk to our family without having to even travel if they live in another country or another state or even if they are your neighbors. Lastly they teach us hand-eye cordination that is a much needed skill that can help you get through life. The fantastic thing about computers are that we can learn about far away places without having to leave the comfort of our home. People of all different countries @MONTH1 be inquestitive about where they came from. They @MONTH1 also wonder how other countries are doing goverement wise or even economic (stocks). All of this is possible and much quicker then watching the news or weather channel. Computers allow us to search the web and arm ourselves with knowledge. The marvelous things about computers is the speed of them. You could be waiting for a stock update on the news channel and wait maybe ten or even twenty minutes. However if you go on your computer and use the internet it makes you life much easier and the faster you can look up somes part of knowledge the faster you might be able to make dinner or even enjoy a nice walk outside and breathe in the nice icy crisp cold air. Also radios and television stations might be a little of with their accuaracy. Maybe a minute later there is a suicide bombing that you might like to know about or the stock might go up one-hundred points or go down one-hundred points. This is all valuable information that people would want to be one-hundred percent accurate. Secondly you can stay in touch with your family even if they live in a different country or in a different state. With webcams that are attachable to some computers or some that are embedded within the computers you can talk to them. My grandma was in the hospital once and I wasn't allowed to see her since I was to young. Since the technology of webcams were invented I was able to see her on the screen instead of seeing her in real life but at least i was able to see if she was doing okay. Webcams are a could way also in discussions. Such as you and your friend are joking and she says something you think is rude but you can't tell that she being sarcastic you might get into a fight. If you have a webcam you can talk to eachother on the computer and see if she is being sarcastic or not. Technology @MONTH1 be one of the greatest inventions that has come forth and @MONTH1 be the best one that will ever be made. That last important thing that you need to know about computers is that they teach you hand-eye cordination. Hand-eye cordination is an important skill that is acquired. This is an important skill because it allows you to suceed in life such as having to write. This skill is also important if you have a job that invloves computers because you need to know how to type and move you fingers fast if you want to suceed in this well payed job. This skill also helps provide a wide range of other suceesful jobs in the world. Computers in the long run are magnificent machines that makes life a lot easier and fun in acquiring knowledge. If you don't have a good hand-eye cordnation you should get a computer because it will help a lot. however if you get a computer you must update it reguarly so you computer will not become slow and start crashing on you. In conclusion computers are the best thing that has been introduced to man kind so far in this world. It allows you to do do many things such as news and how the world is doing globally and how the economy is doing globally. Also it allows you to stay in touch with your family no matter how far you live or what country that you life in. Lastly computers teach you the important skill of hand-eye cordnation. Everyone in the world should be able to have a computer so that they could obtain the knowledge that they would nedd to suceed in life.,10
1242,"Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 a world filled with gargantuan people seated at a moniter, their eyes staring at it blankly. Outside the city streets are deserted, save for the squirils running along fence posts. This is what will happen if people spend to much time on the computers. People will spend less time exercising, less time outdoors enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. This is why computers have a drastic negative affect on people. First of all, people send huge amounts of time on their computers and small amounts of time exercising. In a recent poll done by @ORGANIZATION3 magazine, it stated that @PERCENT1 of people between the ages of @NUM1 and @NUM2 prefer to be online rather than outside exercising. That article also states that since @DATE3, child obesity has increased by @PERCENT2! @PERSON2 of @ORGANIZATION1 at @ORGANIZATION4 states that “ the reason child obesity has increased so much is because children spend so much time in front of the computer and less time outdoors. Do you want this rate to increase in the next ten years? Secondly, spending so much time inside decreases the time you spend outside enjoying nature. Bird watches monthly has had a decrease in subscriptions the @DATE1 because people are not interested in nature anymore. In a study done by @PERSON1 and his collegues at @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 spend almost @PERCENT3 more time indoors infront of electronic devices, most frequently computers, then they do out doors. @PERSON3 says, “@CAPS4 to the new advancements in technology, people are to spend more time indoors than outdoors and that percentage will most likely increase as the decade proceeds”. Finally, spending so much time in front of the computer leaves you less time to interact with family and friends. In @DATE4 more than @PERCENT4 of family ate dinner together now, only @PERCENT5 eat together usually because they are in separate rooms in front of a moniter. This also leads to higher crime rate, believe it or not. Because young children and adolescents don’t have the person to support and guide them because they don’t spend time together @CAPS4 to the frequent use of computers, there is a @PERCENT6 chance that child will commit a crime compared to the @PERCENT7 chance a child would in @DATE5. Do you want that for our youth? Now @CAPS1 a world where people jog together in the park, as they jog, they see a group of bird watchers huddled together under a tree. As the joggers proceed, they come to a pavilion and see a big family celebrating the @DATE2 of a family member. This happy thought won’t become a reality if people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising ,enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. So, local newspaper I encourage you, to encourage others, to get outside and spend less time infront of the computer. You have the power to make a difference in your real lives. But the question is, will you?",12
1243,"To whom @CAPS5 @MONTH1 concern at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS5's possible, imagine a world @CAPS7 computers, @CAPS1 drivers are bumping around and having difficulty watching the wheel and the road, phone bills are throughh the roof because of the whole world having no other way of communicating, and students are home worried sick that they don't have a book to study with. Computers affect all of these areas of our lives. They teach hand-eye coordination, allows us to communicate with others dozens of ways, and let students learn and stay up-dated from their very own home. Computers must stay a fundamental part of our every day. To begin, computers must remain in our community because they teach even young children hand-eye coordination. In a recent report the @ORGANIZATION2 states that in the past five years; the number of driving students who pass on their first try has almost doubled. The video games, the computer mice, and even typing the brain at a young age to work in sync with the body's arms, finger and other apend ages, ""@CAPS5's not only on the road where hand-eye counts."" says @PERSON1, head of surgery at @ORGANIZATION1 hospital. ""@CAPS6 finding that younger doctors, ones that grew up on video and computer games, can form robotics surgery with much more presision than our older atendings."" @CAPS7 the coordination we aquire from the computer many jobs @MONTH1 be out of reach, too. When saked, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 managers of local business said they would have someone who could type, over someone who couldn't. So, though you @MONTH1 think computers teach no they can coordination for the rest of a persons life. Secondly, computers should be part of homes because they allow people to communicate with others world. In a @DATE1 poll, only @PERCENT1 of @NUM3 years old had, but a recent poll says that @PERCENT2 now have e-pals. Computer have opened to communicate e-mail, @CAPS8, social networking sites, just to name a few! Parenting @CAPS9 says that parents prefer there teens to e-mail trends or @CAPS8 as aposed to talk on the phone because @CAPS5 quiets the house, the phonelines for others and keeps phone bill low. My friend once only talked online for a month and her parents encourage her because the phone decreased by a third, @CAPS5's clear that even though you @MONTH1 feel that computers take up time that could be spent with others, @CAPS5's actually a way to communicate with people everywhere. Finaly, computers can help students learn. In todays schools, students depend on homework being posted online, and getting their books over the web. Once, my brother didn't take home his book-bag for a week, and got all online. We was greatful for the strain off his back. When asked @PERCENT3 of @NUM4 graders say they use e-books at least twice a week. the internet also is a valuable research tool. @NUM5 out of @NUM2 highschoolers say they use a book for researh less than once a month. As you can see, the internet is a valuable learning tool. In conclusion, computers help as with coordination, communication and education. Computers have nothing but positive effects on people on society as a whole.",12
1244,"The use of computers is great for everyone. Using a computer can help you learn about different people from around the world. Also you can have the ability to talk to people. With a computer you can also learn about places all over the @LOCATION1 and the world. With a computer everyone can learn about people all over. If you were going on a vacation to somewhere in @LOCATION2 you could learn about what those people do. Also you can see what people your age do for a living. If you had to do a project for school about a place outside of the @LOCATION1 the computer would help a lot. You can search what thet wear and what holdays those people celebrate. Learning about people will help you make friends to. if a foreign exchange person comes to your school you can search about their culture and talk to than about it.

1245,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 one day being able to talk to anyone in the world by simple pushing a button. This has became posible with the computer. I support the advances on technology because computer can help hand eye coordination, it is easy to learn about faraway places or people, and the computer enables you to talk online. This is why it support the computer. First, the computer benifits society because it developes hand eye cordination. Did you know that nine out of ten people who use a computer have improved hand eye coordination. Bill @CAPS2, creator of @ORGANIZATION1, ""The keyboard is the most important part of the computer because it builds hand eye cordination."" This reminds me of when I got my first computer and had no hand eye cordination. @CAPS3 I can type with my eyes closed. I understand how you might think that computers cause people to not get enough exercise, however, the computer can improve your hand eye coordination. This is why I support the computers. Next I support the computer because you can learn about faraway places and people. Did you know that nineteen out of twenty students use a computer when the to learn a place or a person. @PERSON3 stated, ""The way students study is much different than it used to be, @CAPS3 students use computers."" This reminds me of when recently I had a report to do on @PERSON1 and all needed was my computer. I see how you @MONTH1 think that enjoying natures is imprtant, intelegence is even more important .

1246,"How do you think the world would be without computers? I think it would bring us back a couple of ages. We need computers for communication and to learn things that need to learn. Without computers our country would be nothing. People say you don't get enough exercise and don't enjoy nature enough. Well there are ways to do that too. Communication is one of the greatest things about computers. Teenagers love to @CAPS9 @CAPS10 eachother when there at home because its so fast its like really talkiing to them. @CAPS1-@CAPS2 is another thing people love to use. Bosses of companies use @CAPS1-@CAPS2 to send @CAPS10 to everyone so they're all on the same page. There is also a new video chat were you can talk face to face with someone and see them from the other side of the world if you wanted to. You can also learn all you need to know on computers. They have dictionary sites, history sites, encyclopedia sites, etc. You can find any certain time in history and have a whole site on it. Or a site called wikipedia you can look up a certain thing and get a whole web page dedicated to the info of that object or person. Schools also use sites to help students have their knowledge. They have math sites, english sites, @CAPS3 studies sites, and (a science teacher favorite) @CAPS4 @CAPS5 for everything you need to know about science. They also have lots of websites for help with a new language. There is a recent program out caled @CAPS6 @CAPS7 that is on the computer but teaches you any language as well as any human teacher. Some people still say its not enough. They say you still need exercise, nature, and time with your family. You can still do all that on computers. You can look up certain workouts that you might want to do. You can search good trails to hike on that are near where you live.

So are computer advancement recently worth society becoming less interactive? The answer is no.

Kids would rather waste time on the computer than go out play. @NUM1 years ago, when most that many people had computers, you could see people outside playing and having fun with each other, But now, when you look outside, no one is on the local playground having fun and exercising, they are on the internet.

So really the problem to over-weight, its lack of exercize from the computers. Not only are people getting less exercize, they are also not experiencing the healty of nature. With less people going going outside, of exercize, waste nature healty because no-one gets to use it, and harm social skills and family relationships. So please, get off the computer and enjoy life.",7
1789,"Dear @LOCATION1 Time @CAPS1 me tell you what I think of computers there is nothing wrong with people being on computers. I say this because us as kids really do need computers for projects and school work. Also because what if your parents want to move or get a better job but have no car they can use they're computer. Computers actually help the human mind. If you get bored then get on the computer sit back and relax while I explain. In addition I'm not saying that you can use your computer for everything say for an example your teacher gives you an assignment and you can't find it in your book your going to use the computer. If you need pictures for a project but your not an very good artist then you can use your computer. so at the end computer's aren't so bad after all. For an example my mom doesn't have a car or know how to drive. So when she needs to look for a job and no one is there to take her she get's on the internet and find one. Also when it was time for her to move she got on the computer and found a @LOCATION1 house. So like I said computer's are not as bad as people think. When kid's get bored and it's snowing outside and nothing on t.v. Then they can go on the computer, it's not like they don't have educational sites. They have first in math and math for fun. So don't think it's just websites to chat with your friends. In conclusion don't make it seem as through the computer isn't useful because it is. The computer even teach's me things every now and then. So I would say computers @CAPS2! So don't be such a grumpy person because they probably help you sometimes.",8
1790,"Dear Local newspaper, Have you been spending a good portion of your time on computers? Do you think it is effecting you in anyway? Well in this writing piece I am going to tell you how I believe the computers effect you aand everyone else. My first piece of information for the way computers effect people is if they are on the omputer playing games, emailing or listening to music, that is more time you miss spending with thier family or going outside. If they miss time to spend with thier family then you could slowly start drifting apart from them, especially if they don't live near you. One day when that person passed away and you think back you are going to wish you weren't on the compuer three times they were over, you are going to wish you were down there spending time with them. If you miss going outside that is a whole new thing you are missing the sunshine, the snow or whatever kind of temparature there is outside and either way being outside in the fresh air is healthy and so much better than being inside on a computer. The second way computer could effect someones lifen is if you are in a chat room talking to someone and you don't know who it is you have no way to know for sure who you are talking to. It could be a creepy adult or a murder and you'd be thinking that it is a cod kid that wants to be your friends and you could end up letting some information slip. He could ask you to meet him somewhere and they could endup taking you forever and during that time you were talking to him you could of been doing something else than talk to some stranger on the computer. My last thing I believe that bthe computer has an effect on people is that they won't be us active. they'd be lounging around all day on the computer instead of playing a sport or running around outside. Who cares if you colud get hand eye coordination you can play @NUM1 @CAPS1-box with your family and still it's because you get hand eye coordination and youre spending time with family. Even better than that you could be palying outside with your family it will keep you extremely more active than anything and you will be able to spend time with your family. Now that I told you aall of those reasons the computers effect you should know now that spending time off the computer is much more healthier than sitting on the computer all day.",9
1791,"Dear Readers, @CAPS1 you imagine how life would be if we all stop sitting on our behinds on the computer all day but enjoying mother nature? The issue is that experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computer and less time excercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I think we should give the computers a break so that we @CAPS1 get enough excercise, so we @CAPS1 enjoy nature, and so that we @CAPS1 keep our knowledge. I think that we should give the computer a break so that we @CAPS1 start excercising. Who wouldn't want to excersize to stay in shape. I remember when me and my mom used to exercise once a day so that we @CAPS1 stay in good shape. Surely if you go on the computer everyday instead of exercising you will start to gain weight. Who would want to gain weight? Why should a person not exercise and stay healthy? Another reason why we should give computers a break is so that people @CAPS1 enjoy nature. For example, they @CAPS1 go to the park or even ride their bikes. In @ORGANIZATION1 school @PERCENT1 say that they love to ride their bike instead of going on the computer. Why not go outside and smell the fresh air, or even go swimming at the beach? Another reason we should give the computer a break is so that we @CAPS1 keep their knowledge. For example if you stay on the computer and play games you will lose your focus on work. Why should your parents be worried because their kids grades are slowly decreasing and decreasing every second. Why should smart kids get low grades over playing games on their computers? So now I say ""I wont waste my knowledge ever again"". It's now or never! Should kids give the computer a break or not. I think they should because they wont get enough exercise, so that the kids @CAPS1 enjoy mother nature. Also so that they @CAPS1 keep their knowledge. This is why kids should to focusing on computers. So why not go waisting your time and knowledge on computers now!",9
1792,"Dear newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers help with education believe it or not. They let people keep in touch with each other no matter where they are. Also computers help people with so many useful things. Education is a very important thing in life. And computers are a big part of education. In my school we do many things on the computer like typing papers, research projects, and sometimes even rests. Computers dont only help with education in school but at our own homes too. When your surfing the web you might come across articles of people and places and that helps your education. The computer is also a good place to learn about history, you can find out about the worlds history or maybe even your own family history. Computers can teach people a lot. Computers can also be helpful for peoples health if you use them the right way. Instead of looking up silly stuff look up what foods you can eat that are good for you and what you can do to stay healthy. You can look up recipes that are healthy and delicous. On the computer you can get tons of other peoples opinions on ways to stay healthy which is better than just getting our opinion from somebody you know. Computers can also help you excercise. You can find out different types of excercises and stretches. You can even watch excercising videos and follow along with them. Its possible that you find a video or type of excercise that works good for you. Instead of searching things on the internet that are not useful look up something important like your health. Computers are useful in thousands of different ways. One way is keeping in touch with people. I keep in touch with my friends by using facebook, myspace, and aim. A lot of other people use these sites to. These sites also help me keep in touch with my family. I talk to cousins that live a city down from mine and even my family members that live across the country and in another continent. Computers are also not just for the important things in life there to have fun too. There are millions of websites with games, jokes, and funny videos. There are so many uses for a computer. In conclusion computers have a very positive effect on people. They help children and adults with there education and learning. The internet can also help people live healthy so they can have a happy life. There are so many different uses of a computer, you can do almost anything on it. Computers can defenitely have a positive effect on people.",9
1793,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 the caveman found fire, ever, thought what would happen if he did not use it? Well that is where we are today. The computer is our fire. Some people might not be able to compare a computer to fire, but the advancement in technology is just about the same. There are now tons of people who use computer. I definetly agree that we should continue the use of computers. Computers help people learn, we can communicate better, and it will allow us to advance farther. The computer can help us learn. It can teach us about faraway places that we probably would never have known that they existed. We can learn about the weather better. If we did not did not have computers we would have never left earth. Or be able to make @CAPS2. The computer has already helped us a math teacher, @PERSON1 said"" Computers have boosted the kids knowledge @CAPS5 much. I never learned some of the stuff @CAPS1 i was growing up. This next generation will be the we have had yet."" @CAPS3 more than we could have alone, @CAPS5 why get rid of it? The computer can also help us communicate better and faster. which the avoke in the @LOCATION2 happened, it might have taken a weck or even a month for the @LOCATION1 to hear about it, and longer to try and go down to help. By then the people would have to try and fix it. it up themselves for two months or more. I remember yesterday. I had a board of education meeting to go to. It was really importan checking my @CAPS4-mails on the computer and I found out that i needed to go. It was better that i found out and not the next day @CAPS1 my boss was going to yell at me because i did not go. That is how useful the computer is to communicate. The computer is also goind to help us @CAPS3 farther. It is like the fire. It helped People @CAPS3 @CAPS5 much, @CAPS5 once the computer is at its peak, it will push us just as for the fire did. Survey shows that @PERCENT1 of the children population is already smarter than the adult population. @CAPS5 @CAPS1 the children become adults there is nothing this world cannot do. we would be able to colonize the galaxy! @CAPS5, as you can see, computers are more beneficial than bad. they help teach people new stuff, communicate faster and better, and will help us @CAPS3 farther. Think about it, millions of years from now, people will say, ""@CAPS6 if man never made computers, that would be worse than the fall of empire."" @CAPS7 you for taking the time to read this letter.",9
1794,"Dear newspaper editor, @CAPS1 now is a letter to explain to us all, that computers are not a major destroyer of society. They don't just make people exercise less, they don't just make people interact less with family. They help so much, and not many people can see that. Computers are a wonderful thing to society. They help people make friends, they help with giving information, and they make our lives easier. For a start, computers are good because they introduce us to new people. For example, if you are shy or socially awkward, you know it's very hard to make new friends. However, with a computer you won't feel as shy, which helps make friends easily! Another example is that if no one wants to be your friend for your appearance, then the computer can help. You can make friends without being seen by them which is a great thing if you are emoarressed or being stopped by your appearance. Computers help make friends in many more ways as well. Therefore, computers are a great thing for a society. They also provide us information. Another reason why computers are a nice thing for our society, is that they give us info. If you need help on some work or a project, for example, you can find almost anything from the computer. maybe you even want to study for a test; you can study on the computers. Also, you can learn about any place in the world. If you need information of a hotel, you just want to learn or if you want to know about something that happened there, it's all on the computer. Even if you just wont the news of one place, you can find it with the computer. Thus, makes the computer a fantastic item that helps the society. Besides info, they make our lives easier. As my final reason, computers benefit society by making our lives easier to handle. Such a way they do this is that make files easier to make and organize. When writing something it might have mistakes and be harder to read, but computers show your mistakes and have easy to read fonts. My next example in that when you have something in real life it is so easy to lose or misplace. On the other hand, computers store whatever you upload, so they cant be lost. Something as important as pictures can be saved by adding them to your computers. As you can see, computers help the lives of all. Now you can agree with me when I say. Computers have a huge effect on society. They show us new people. They consist of much helpful info. They make.",9
1795,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, there has been some talk about how computers are changing our world for the better. Computers are apparently the only way their we will survive in the future. This is nonsense! Computers are taking away our valuable sleep hours, our rights to a good education, and our health! Computers are in fact the way of the unhealthy future. I ask you to go ahead a think about the time you spend on the computer. The average teen in the year @DATE1 spent @NUM1 hours a day on the computer. Now compare that to the amount of time you spent as keep. Chances are high that you only get @NUM1 or @NUM3 hours asleep making the amount of time you spent going on the web and the amount of beauty set you got about the same. That right there should tell you, that something is arong with the computer lifestyle. We all fall victim to drowsiness.. every once in a while is alright. However, for every hour you spend on the computer your are @PERCENT1 sleeper then you were! @CAPS5 is the price of losing energy worth @CAPS4? Did you know that millions of people wake up as early as they can just to be playing on the computer. Some wake up as early as @NUM4 in the morning! Forgive me if I'mmistaken but @NUM4 o'clock in the morning just to talk on facebook is breaching insanity. Sleep is important @CAPS5 playing on the computer isn't worth our @NUM6's. Not only is losing precious sleep bed but now the devil's invention is deleting our education from our now computer operated minds! Ask any student how much time they spend studying the answer will be I don't need to study. ""@CAPS2 that sound right. Kids do need to study they just want to chat with friends online. The average students grade went down @PERCENT2 list year because of all the time spent on the computer. Speaking of the ever trendy online chat..how many time have you heard lol, omg, or @CAPS3? Well one things for sure @CAPS4 in papers, worksheets, and just about anything that a computer kids hands in! Another issue is that kids who don't care about school are effecting the thought of those who do. One kid said ""@CAPS4's only cool to talk online school is for."" This is the wrong message to send kids! School is cool. Finally computers are throwing away our health. More and more people are getting diseases because they spend too much time in front of the screens @PERCENT2 more people got diabetes last year do to lack of exercise. Playing sports has been proven as away to make a child more well rounded. Computers do net, @CAPS5 don't we want to un-plug ourselves and live dive into sports? Sports will also make your mind more fit. They will teach you to work as a team and not give in to peer pressure. @CAPS5 as you can see computers are lending this world down a dark road. @CAPS4's time we say enough and become unplugged! Our life shouldn't be compermised for time spent on the computer. These inventions are giving us less beauty sleep, throwing our education in the recycling bin, and giving us a life with our health! Stop this injustice and unplug that computer!",11
1796,"Dear Local Newspaper, I would like to complain about the everyday use of computers. I believe that now in days the use of computers are being abused. Many people use the computer and doesn’t spend time with the family. The everyday use of computers is also causing certain people to gain access weight. Another reason is that by staring at the screen can create eye damage! As you knew my first complaint is how by being on the computer s much it takes away time spent with family and friends. Most of the day you are on the computer gives no room for family time. So that for one is not a great thing. My second reason people shouldn't be on the computer so much is because it's causing people to gain access weight. By just sitting on the computer all day you get no exercise whatsoever, so you gain weight not wanted. The only thing your body that gets exercise while on the computer is your fingers. Also the human body needs exercise! My final reason that the computer shouldn't be in so much use is because it can cause eye damage. When your eyes look at the screen for a long period of time, they tend to strain. So this can cause your next trip to the eye doctor. Well I have explained all my reasons to you and I hope you understand. Computers are fun but you got to give them a rest sometimes unless you want to lose time with the family, gain weight, or maybe your next trip to the eye doctor then you might want to turn it off and go jogging, or camping with the family! Thank you for taking time off your schedule to read my complaints!",8
1797,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 having kids wasting there whole lives by being on the computer to much. I sure wouldn’t want my son to be like that. Being on the computer too much can make you unhealthy from not exercising, not be able to enjoy nature, and keep you away from you friends and family. Not much good can came out of being on the computer @NUM1. Please newspaper take my word. @CAPS4 will make you well known @CAPS3 you agree with me on this. First of all, being on the computer all day, everyday can make you unhealthy by not exercising. @PERCENT2 of people that do not exercise live less longer to the people that do exercise. Times @CAPS2 said. “@CAPS3 you spend your life on the computer and don’t take a jog once in a while. Then @CAPS4 can hurt you body in a days, and way.” I believe that quote the @PERCENT1 @CAPS5. @PERSON2 stated to me, “@CAPS3 you can’t get off the computer, @CAPS4 can hurt your body badly and can make you less athletic because you are so used & not exercising, “@CAPS3 doctor said that you should believe @CAPS4 trust me this will be a great decision. You will see improvements everyday. Second of all. You won’t be to enjoy nature @CAPS3 you are on the computer for so long. @PERCENT3 of students that don’t get some fresh air once in a while can make them less with the worth. @CAPS5 @PERSON1 said, “ @CAPS3 you don’t pay attention to nature, then you won’t know anything about the earth and what have gone on “ that will not be helpful in your social studies class. Peoples @CAPS2 use said. “@CAPS7 on the computer and not enjoying the outdoors can actually make you less smarter on what you do. “I have even heard that same qoute from doctors, too my friend. Dive was a straight A student and very popular. He is a very tall and handsome kid. Then all of the sudden, one day he met a computer and invite sports and never went outside and @CAPS4 change him a lot. I would never want that to happen to me or any of my friends again. The is do you want to happen to you? Lastly computers can less interaction with friends and family. @PERCENT4 of students that still on the computer become less close with friends and even family. That is not a good thing at all. @CAPS5 @PERSON3 said, ""computer only cause mental and less interactions with friends & family at school. “@CAPS4 is very interesting that people still use computers after all of those reasons. The @CAPS8 @CAPS9 newspaper said, “computers decreasing bond of family and friends. “I agree with that statement the whole one yards. @CAPS4 is just very sad how people waste their lives doing same thing that is not good for them. Please make the next choice or @CAPS4 will be to late. To sum @CAPS4 all us. @CAPS1 children outside and could better. That can happen @CAPS3 you make the decision I am changing right now. @CAPS3 you don’t @CAPS4 can keep them from exercising, enjoying outdoors and nature, and interacting with family and friends. No one wants that, so please read my carefully newspaper make the decision and make @CAPS4 right.",10
1798,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 should think that computers are a good thing because this technology help people everyday in many different ways. Computers can allow you to have fun playing games, do research for work, @CAPS4 new people, and many businesses are built around computers. Lets think about how a computer can effect @CAPS3's life. A man or women goes to work and then goes to the computer. Well maybe this man is a scientist who is using the computer to save findings, help research new ones, and make calculations, @CAPS5 job depends on computers to discover new findings. The man might be a person who answers @NUM1 calls. @CAPS5 computer can help save lives by telling them where the person in need is calling from and how to get there. So these machines are powerful work resourses. Computers can also entertain people when they get bored. It is just like any other video game, you get to go online and play with friends or make new friends in the proses. If a person is bored and has nothing to do then they can hop on a computers go to a website or put in a @CAPS6 and play many fun games. It is a good way to learn and entertain in your free time. People will alway learn from computers. You can find interesting facts, how to build things or just about anything you can think of will be on the computer. Besides many schools use computers to help educate their students by using interactive game that aid many kids into learning more can just teach them in general. The people will always think for themselves and most will not give their computer just because someone says that it is bad for them. I have opened up to the people to try to convince them that computers are not us but they are doing quite the opposite and are helping us in everyday life. They help us Learn, have fun, and some people even depend on them to make a living. Thank You.",8
1799,"Dear Local @CAPS1, Computers, and other technology are very popular today. Many people look at computers saying well they are innapropriete the way children and young adults are using them. Well, those are only the negatives of computers there are many positive things in having a computer. Starting off with Online @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 @CAPS4, learning about faraway places. Lastly, chatting online with family or friends. First off, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and online learning sites are populating more and more to this day. If our society didn't have online toutering or @CAPS3 @CAPS4 students wouldn't be able to learn up to their fullest potential. If a high amount of society didn't believe in online activities now would we as students get the knowledge we have now. Also, this online @CAPS2 is an opportunity for students to learn by themselves & classes that their school @MONTH1 not offer. If someone were to ever to take that away we would not be where we are today in this world because we would not have those people who went above and beyond in their learning due to society. Next, online chat is really big throughout our nation. This is an opportunity to talk with family members that live faraway. Also this is an opportunity to hook up with your old friends who @MONTH1 have moved away. About @PERCENT1 of our world looks at online chatrooms as being a bad influence on children when really the problem is the parents letting their (son/daughter) child use online chatroom who are immature. Lastly, online is a world to explore throughout. Just like the world we live in. You can go online and research any topic you want to such as culture through out our world. Different countries have different cultures and you can learn about them online. Also, you can find different attractions to different countries, states, counties and towns as well as book tours and go on trips to these places. Such as china you can start off by researching that country then you can go visit that country and see what you missed. There are many reasons to look at computers in a bad manor. I can see how: because people are taking advantage of technology and not using their own so it is brainwashing people and making @PERCENT2 of the people that use computer think one day nobody will live without using computers. There are many good reasons too have a computer. One is to advance your knowledge as far as you can. So why don't our society do so. And look at computer to @CAPS4 with peoples lives.",9
1800,"Why people should use computers? Computers are good for people because you have something else to do while your learning things you don't know. One of the reasons why computers are good for people is because, family, friends around the world, like if your in other country and you can't see your family or friends you will just go on the computer and video chat with them, if you wanna keep in touch with people that you know for a long time the computer could keep them intouch, if you miss someone and you dont have a phone the computer might be a great idea. Also it helps you on questions that you have, if you don't know a word you can go on @ORGANIZATION1 and you will find the defenition if the teachers gives you homework and its very hard and you can't find the answer on the book the computer have all the answers you need, if your friends say something about any subject and you have no idea what are they talking about you could go look it up and learn something new in life. In the computer you could see things before anyone does, like you could whatch videos over and over again to see what real happend. It give you the real apportunity to learn something new that you will remember all your life, but computers are not use all the time you could spend sometime outside and have fun also. Computers are good for you and help you in your homework or in things you don't know, and getting in touch with people you wanna see/talk, the computers are a lot of fun, but also spending time outside with other people could be very nice too.",8

Couped up in your basement updating friends spaces and playing games on your computer. You probably havent seen the sun in a few weeks, either. @CAPS3 argue this is bad because computers are addictive and restrict exersising, enjoying nature and social events such as family and friends. But is @CAPS9 really allthat bad? For instance, you can chat with people accross the globe, send and receive messages at breakreck speed, and learn things about farway places like the @ORGANIZATION5. this is where I stand on this contreversal debate. @CAPS6, @CAPS4 possibly the biggest thing since electricity. There are billions. No, @CAPS5 things to do on the @CAPS6 more other are being made each @CAPS14. Wether @CAPS9 be a fan site for people like @CAPS7.J sandwiches or a viral site such as @CAPS8 or myspace. And while @CAPS9 is addiding, @CAPS9 has @CAPS3 upsides to @CAPS9. @CAPS6 games help with hand-eye coordinating and @CAPS20 your ever sluck on homework. The @CAPS6 will teach you. This is only a small reason why computers are a good thing. @CAPS21 what @CAPS20 your computer doesn't support @CAPS6? what @CAPS9 good for? Nothing right? WRONG! The computer has installed apps such as the brain bending @CAPS10 sweeper, or the reaction testing pinball. Also, you can always install games like the @ORGANIZATION6 (real-time-strategy) @CAPS11, @ORGANIZATION2. this is on @ORGANIZATION3 the games, along with @ORGANIZATION3, and @ORGANIZATION3 @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS12 that tasts how well your headership skills are along with money management, and planning.

You can play old games such as @CAPS15, @CAPS16 @CAPS17, @ORGANIZATION4, and @CAPS18-@CAPS19. @CAPS21 why is @CAPS9 @CAPS21 bad ?

Also, you can have an aspect @ORGANIZATION3 what gaming was like @CAPS13 then white @CAPS9 is @CAPS24 to get to know your world and the people in @CAPS9, you should your computer time to @NUM5-4 hours a @CAPS14 which reminds me @ORGANIZATION3 the time that a person @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS25.K for @NUM3 hours streight. @CAPS24, but not a good @CAPS26. @CAPS21 go get a computer and @CAPS27!""",12
1802,"Dear local newspaper: I am writing this letter to tell you I think computers have a positive effect on people that they benifit in the society. I as a single person think computers benifit the society because they give people the ability to learn about faraway places, can let people talk and chat onlines with other people and can help with education. Now on to making sure you agree with me. First compouts can give people the ability to learn interesting facts on neat stuff about very faraway places that you have never ever herd of befor. For example once I had to do a movie on a forgive country that I knew nothing about so what did I do? I want to the computers. Thier I found many fact and data about the place. Now if I can do that you can to and it will be very quick and very easy. Secondly you can talk to people or live chat with people even if their miles away. Their is many different sites and places to chat too. Like me I go and talk to my friends on @CAPS1, or myspace oncwe in a while. Also lets say you haven'ts seen a relative in a while you realy want to see them. But its allmost impossible to well not anymore.",7
1803,"Effects of computers @CAPS1 local newspaper, Have you ever realized @CAPS7 computers effect you and the people around you? well, I think the effects come in a bad way. for example, you could get abducted from strangers online, your grades would slip, and you wouldnt be able to live you life like a kid or adult anymore. @CAPS7, you will see my first explanation. First, you could get abducted from strangers online. When you're in the chat rooms, where you shouldn't be in the first place, kids and adults tend to talk to strangers. then they start telling them where they live, when puts both you and your family in jeapordy. This way, you shouldn't stay on the computer for a long time, because then you would be tempted to talk in chat rooms. Here is my next reason. Next, your grades would slip. When you get home, all you think about is, ""@CAPS2's new on facebook."" @CAPS3, ""@CAPS2 can I buy @CAPS7, this isn't healthy. You should be doing your homework when you get home. @CAPS3, adults should be worrying about bills, not about the email they just got, @CAPS5 time flys when you're on the computer, theres no way anyone will have time to do anything. @CAPS3, when you're at school or work, all you can think about is going home playing that new game on you computer. How are you suppost to concentrate on anything once you have that on you mind. Here's my last reason, @CAPS6, you wouldn't be able to live you life like an adult or child anymore. When you're a kid, you usually like playing outside, or playing with your pets, friends, and family. Well, when you spend most of your time on the computer, how are you going to burn calories, and run around by getting you energy out. You might even be a bad influence on you brother and sister. Without any exercise isn't good for your body. for adults, they wouldn't have time to pay for bills or spend time with their family. The kids would have no father figure to talk to or a mom to disguse their problems, @CAPS7 you will see all of my reasoning. In conclusion, computers control you life. I think they are truly just a device to make you loose control of you life. You could get abducted, you grades could slip, and you wouldn't be able to live your life. As you can see they inform but control.",8
1804,"Dear to whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 is an issue on where technology benefical to our society. @CAPS1 are many ways people could benefit from new and advanced technology, and @CAPS1 ways people cannot. In this letter, I will be describing to you, the type of ways people can benefit from technology. First of all, computers give students and adults a chance of having an education. For example, if a young girl has a child and can't afford to stay in school, online classes gives them the chance to care for their child and still receive an education. If an adult a degree online will help them achieve. People need, technology offer, to give it. Secondly, some people are that if someone is always online, they will and see. He for what it is. Have you thought the flip side of that will computers, people can still explore the world. You can work. Finally, computer help families stay in touch. Computers are a great way for people to stay communicated. For example, maybe your phone isnt working properly or maybe not even working at all and you want to contact a friend or relative, you can easily go online with chat or webcam, etc to keep them notified on anything important or just to say hello. Wouldn't you want to still to communicate with too? In conclusion, Technology is advancing more and more, all the time. It's only getting better. Online classes, exploration of the world, and communicating with fellow people are just some of the things technology can do. Wouldn't you want to experience some of the things it can do?",8
1805,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Advances in technology can ruin the future of our children. A computer, a thing that most people have although it comes with very good things about it there is also a lot of negative things. A couple examples are people can become addicted to the computer. So they stay all up in their house, in their room, where their computer is. Another reason is the dangers of computers. With technology advancing the internet is very dangerous and you have to be careful what information you give out. And at last cyber bullies just like actually bullies but instead of physically hurting someone cyber bullies mentally and emotionally take someone down and hurt them. As you can see these are only a few reasons why technology is becoming dangerous thing and has a negative effect on people and their life. Physical exercise is a good thing, it is needed if you want to stay and be a healthy person. But you can't get out go for a run and get physical exercise if your on the computer doing whatever you do. So the computer is haveing a negative affect on people because they arent getting at side and enjoying the fresh air. Instead they are inside on the computer. Alot of people are gamers so they could be all caught up in a whole different. That's a bad thing. It's bad becasue some people get so addicted to a game they gte addicted and maybe even. So if you obssesed with something your go to do it all the time, so when your inside being obsseses with whatever your obssesed to stay healthy. There are many dangers on the computer. For example petifiles. Petifiles are always on the for young kids they. Petifies disguse themselves as most likely teenagers or people on their @NUM1's and they tride kids into meeting or with them so the kids think they're meeting up with a person they thaght the petifile is but really they are just doing in a trap and could end up in a very dangerous serious situation that could end up death or go missing and never seen again. And dangerous thing on the internet is atlkers. This world isnt a safe the world is a cold and deciving place they is filled with people who will hate you and people who are crazy. So you have to be carefull on what kind of information you put out on the internet because you never know you could be stalked and that's another very dangerous situation. The last reason I'm going to mention is cyber bullies some might say are almost worse than actual bullies because cyber bullies mentally attack you and hurt you instead of physically. They are very mean people who will do whatever it takes to take somebody down. An example of a bad ending to cyber buling was there was a kid. I knew his name was @PERSON1.Everybody thaght he was gay because he didnt football as a summer so this buly went on @CAPS1 and started argue called @PERSON1 he is a gav fog and everybody and wrote mean comments about him and @PERSON1 got bullied so much couldnt like it anywhere and locked and hung himself and his mom found the next morning dead hanging in his closet. So as you can see their are many reasons why advance in technology isnt a good thing because many things even now have a bad turnout.",9
1806,"Dear newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing this letter to state my opinion on if I think computers are good or bad. Well computers are becoming well known in society we can buy laptops, desktops, phones that can go on internet.t.v.s gaming systems. I do think that this could have an affect on kids not going ouside as much and not getting exercise and seeing nature, I do belive though technology is a big part of life as we get older all our jobs deal with using computers such as a banker, ultrasonagrapher, teacher. To be prepared for jobs in our upcoming futres students should be well known to a computer and know how to use it. They shoud be able to know how to do presentations with there computers type well without looking and set documents into folders. Although I think the kids should be using computers and have a computer class in school. It doesn't mean that they will always be on a computer. School has a big part of getting students to go outside, exercise. They are able to get that during gym and wehn weathers nicer they are able to go outside and do activities. The kids can also join school sports team and sports teams outside of school. Besides getting exercise they can also comunicate with people across the world this benifits from learning different people cultures. I comepletly think that technology will benefit people for life and it will have a positive outcome on them, I hope you can too.",8
1807,"Dear Local newspaper, I do agree that to many people spend there time on the computers. In my opinion first I think they do because less time enjoying nature. Secondly, not enough time exercising. Also, there not interacting with family and friends @CAPS1 writing to urge you that to many people spend time on the computers. I hope you will agree with what @CAPS1 saying as you read on. As you can see many people spend alot of time on the computer but less time enjoying nature. For instance, you can go around help the community, help the homeless you can also have a day to your self go get some fresh air and take a walk. If I was oyu this is what I would do. Secondly, they spend to much time on the computers because they are not interacting with they family and friends. For example, I like to spend time with my family and friends. We go out to eat, the mall, we even sometimes just play the games together to have fun. Just like they should want to en joy being with there family and friends, you will have an closer relationship by doin that instead of being on the computer all day. Lastly, they spend to much time on the computers because they have less time exercising. In contrast like now we have alot of over weight teens. They rather be on the computer instead of going to a gym and exercise. I always try to exercise at home or when I'm playing basketball I do alot of running. If you ask me I believe exercising is better for you the sittin on the computer all day. In conclusion, as you can see less time enjoying nature, interacting with family and friends, and less time exercising. Is better for you than being on the computer being lazy. I hope that you will understand the way I am feeling about this situation.",8
1808,"Dear Local Newspaper, I heard about people's opinions on computers and I thought I should share my thoughts on what I think being a person who spends an hour on the computer a day, I completley understand what people say when they say computers can be a distractment @MONEY1 your life. But I do not agree with this. There ore some positive things about computers. Some people in the world can not find jobs. Some people in the world have amazing talents and they are not discovered it. This is where websites like youtube.com come into play. People who are musically talented sometimes set discovered in youtube, and then in a flash they are making @MONEY1 a year. If the world did not have computers, very talented singers would not be where they are today. You tube is not the only website that is changing. Facebook.com can help you re-connect with the people to lost touch with. I was reading a magazine one day and I read about a girl who lost touch with her biological brother and found him so facebook. Sometimes computers can bring people together, and that is definetly not a bad thing. Have you ever gotten sick @MONEY1 your life and wanted to go on a nice vacation? I bet @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM2 readers in this paper would say that in some days, they would not mind a great escape. Computers can help you research far away places so you know where you would be going computers can give up the information you need so you will know anything and everything about where you are headed. Some people @MONTH1 beleve that computers are not necessary because instead @MONEY1 being online, you could be excersising or doing anything else to improve your health. I think people should still have computer acess, but limit the amount @MONEY1 time they spend on it a day. If people did not spend all their time online, I am sure people would not feel on issue about computers. In conclusion, computers are actually pretty they can help you and jobs, re-connect with friends and family, and look up places you are wanting to go. But also, people should be living their lives. Limit yourself on the computer thats something we can do right?",9
1809,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have an extremely bad effect on the people of society. Instead of getting stuck on the computer all day, we could start excersing and losing weight. We could also go to a soup kitchen and give out meals. Finally, we could save the environment from all of the electricity we use. It would benefit not only yourself, but others as well, if we did theese things.. To start, I would suggest that people stop spending so much time on the computer, and join a gym. I mean, who would want to be the one to be at home, bored, on the computer? You could be having so much more fun with your friends on the treadmill. @PERSON1 @CAPS2 from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, states, ""The key to losing weight, is to be motivated and have fun."" You can't do that on the computer. Eating right can also impact how much weight you lose. You could learn where to eat right by going to a soup kitchen. First of all, going to a soup kitchen would help many people who need food and nutrition. I remember a time when I was going to a soup kitchen with my church. I definately didnt want to go, but, I had to. Once I got there, I really started to enjoy it. Another reason you should go to a soup kitchen, is to meet new people. It would help you to get to know them and be friendly. The most important thing to hungry people to love. If you went to a soup kitchen, you could give them that and fresher air by riding on a bike. I firmly think that going on a bike would help the environment as well as if we all turned off our computers. Studies show we use about @NUM1 kilowatts of energy a week. I we shut off our computers for only one week, it would bring that number down to @NUM2 kilowatts. I feel that the environment is an important part of the world and that we need to take care of it. If we do, it will last a lot longer. By using the computer less, there will be less polution. We won't have to waste our world or be selfish for unimportant things. In conclusion we should go to a soup kitchen excersize and turn off the computers. They are a very bad influence on america. Computers have to much of a bad effect on society.",9
1810,"Although some people believe computers aren't very usefull, you'll see why they are benefits to the society. Friends and family can keep it touch. Computers are very helpful with school, work, and projects. They also help test harmful, dangerous or tricky experiments. I know tons of people who are only able to keep in touch with faraway friends or family by using computers. For example, my friend that lives here in @LOCATION1, keeps in touch with his grandmother and grandfather that lives in @LOCATION2, by using the video chat on his computer. This allows him not only to talk to his grandparents, but to see them as well! Computers also help friends to keep it touch with websites like, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, etc. The websites aren't harmful, but helpful. Friends love to use the websites to keep in touch with friends and family. Computers are also very helpful with schools, work, etc. I always use my computer when I have a project in school that I need some help on. Everyone uses computers when they would like acurate data. Computers are easier to find information for a book, and information is posted everyday. Which just shows how computers are much more up to date then books are. I'm not just saying this. This can be proven. As well as, typing up a project and printing it out for school, work, etc., is a lot neater and with the ability to spell check, gramer check, etc, on computers. You will have less mistakes on a project when you use a computer. Now, for me last opinion on computers. How would harmful chemical testing be without computers? How could we be sure our cars are running fine, and are safe to be in without computers? There are so many things that we depend on a computer to tell us is safe. Computers also help us design cars, buildings, etc. For example, say engineers are try to make a new small compact car that is safe enough to protect the drives in a @NUM1 car crash. Are the engineers going to make tons of different cars, put people in them and crash into a wall going @NUM1? No! We have the to test it on computer. Clearly, we must rethink the way we look at computers. They were made to help us. I told you how they help friends and family keep in touch from long distances I also told you how they can help you with school, work, projects, chemical testing, car testing, etc. Computers are made to help us and they always will. I see nothing wrong with the creation of computers, everyone uses it. ",11
1811,"Computors are looked at as either friend or foe. I see computors and technoledges as friends not an enemy to battle against! Without the computor keeping in touch with people would be limited greatley. In schools computors help us learn different open our world so we are not just limited to places close by that people have told us about. They are truly magnificent! My best friend is moving to @LOCATION1 in two years. When she does I will have to keep in touch with her mainly by computor. Email is not only cheaper but quicker than mail. And like my friend, someone you know might live in a diferent time zone and making calls could be difficult. Computors don't only allow you to keep in touch with distant friends and reletives but also people close to you. Everyone has a scheduaule, they are a part of everyday life. Finding the time to talk to someone is difficult expesualy when their schedual never seems to match yours. You don't want to lose the freindship or cut your ties so what do you do? Email then when you can via the computor! You have time then and there and don't know when you'll have some again. That makes mailing somthing quite difficult. Life is basicly one giant schedual with empty slots for 'you' time. In this 'you' time there are many things you can do. For example, go online and look up interesting places to go around your area. After using some of your 'you' times for research you can take a day off and go somewhere as a reward for all your hard research. Things like this are very hard without the computor. You would only be able to go places you knew or heard of. Computors help you and different places with more information then you could get from one or two people. They do more than just look up places and information to make plans for just you, you could do a double team and go some place with two people who both information from their computors. Or have a whole look up information and plans for a group outing of family or your closest friends. Besides keeping in touch or making plans computors can teach you. How many times have you needed to know somthing and looked it up on the computor? You can find online dictionarys and translators for free! I've often used the computor to translate @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 and @CAPS2 to @CAPS1 for projects that we arn't expected to know words on. Working men and woman so online to go back to school while still working full time. My mom does that to set in working with preschoolers! My sister has used to the computor to look up information about colleges as she is going soon. Can't you see that computors arn't out to kill society? They are here to help you keep in touch with your greatly missed family and friends in far off places! To help you make plans for some rightly earned 'you' time, 'friend' time, and 'family' time! To give you a chance at a better job helping you learn! Can you see now how computors are here for help? Sure people missuse them but that can easily be prevented by parents keeping a close eye on their children and adults watching ther time closley.",10
1812,"Dear local Newspaper, I am writing to you today to inform you, my opinion on the effect that computers has on people. I belive hthat computers has a benefial effect on people, because its up to date technology can help you learn things faster. Also, you can talk with people online all around the world, and even reconnect with old friends. Finally, computers allow you to find stuff out now faster, like sports stats and news storys. I dont know any other faster researcher ther a computer. Its like you can search for anything and find an answer for it. You can search for a recipe or baked ahska and you can actually get it in a matter of seconds. Instead of goin to the book store and buying a whole @NUM1 doller book on it. A computer is like having a book store in your living room. Also lets say your a college student studying for your mid-term, and you left your books at school, you can just go on the computer and search for what you need to study on. And bamm! There it is right in your eyes! Okay, so lets say your in school right, and your dad gets a job and you to have move far away. You don't have to worry about loseing your old friends, and contact with them. If you have a computer, you can chat with your friends anywhere. I mean like c'mon how cool is that! Your in @STATE1 chatting with your old friends back in new york! Thats pretty awesome. Also, lets say you where in high school and you and your high school sweet heart, where going strong and she away. Through the magic of the internet you can reconnect with that person and ones! Finally, your business man, and your jammed up at work with alot of meetings. You dont have time to go home and check the news. You can just go on your computer and check it from the office. You can watch the news and still have time for your @NUM2 o clock brunch, because you dident go home to see something you could in your office. Thats the beauty of it. Big sports fan, but stuck out at work and cant see the big game. But wait your bummed out for nothing because the game is at a click of a button if you watch it on your computer! You never have to miss the game again! In conclusion, i think the computer is a beniefial for people because, you can learn things way faster on it. Also because, you can chat and reconnect with old and new people. And last because, you can check the news and sports without having to leave the office!",9
1814,"Dear news paper, Computers are good for people in many ways. They help us learn, just the way in school. They are helping us to learn more the just because some people don't like them doesnt mean shouldn't. After all, it is our lives. @CAPS1 do kids pay attention in school. But @CAPS1 we use the computer that's more we can learn. We can learn how to use the webcam to interact with our friends on the computer. We can do research to look up things that we do for school. Instead of learning something in school, and about it. We can read, and see a picture on video to understand it more. Computers teach us how to use more machines. We don't know what is going to be made? in the culture on how had they are going to be to use. So isn't it better if we know how to use them now? Some people don't even know how to use computer, or even cell phones. But @CAPS1 we get other cuture, that maybe a big problem. Just because some people spend all their time on the computers and don't do other things. doesn't mean we all do. I only go on the computer @CAPS1 I'm about to go to bed. But i'm out side, all day, I @CAPS2 do things with my family. So if some people have problems with computers, doesn't mean that we all do and to face the problems toward that so as I told you, computers, help us learn more thing in and even things for school. They teach us how to use things don't know gonna be in the just because some people are lazy doesnt mean we all are and have to deal with the people that do. So we should be able to use the computer without haging to deal people complaints. It is our lives.",8

1816,"Dear Newspaper. I @CAPS2 that people are spending to much time on computer. They are hurting their eyes, gaining weight, and they aren't giveing the @CAPS1 what it needs. When you stare at a computer scren your eyes cant regenerate from the brightness & all the words & pictures. Your eyes shouldn't nbe punished like this they didn't hurt you, why do you want to hurt them? @CAPS5 always told that if I stare at something for a length of time @CAPS3 eyes wont readjust to their normal self because of straining themself for so long. I realy don't @CAPS2 all of you stareing at a computer want problems. Many people who just sit around are gaining weight, and you wonder why? Maybe its bevause your not out & moving around. When you eat you gain fat cells, callories, nutrients, and alot more. But when you gain those things from the food, your body needs to prove around to help break sitting still only tells the @CAPS1 do stop and hold everything there. To break all of the things down your body needs to be moving around I dont know about you people but I try @CAPS3 best to give thing it needs to maybe this will convince you! The @CAPS1 is the most important thing in your body. You need to make sure it's getting every thing it needs maybe you @CAPS2 you are healthy but your @CAPS1 needs fresh air and nutrients from the food. Sitting in a chair or laying down does not help anything at all. I used to do the same thing a while me that if I kept sitting I playin on the computer, @CAPS3 body wont be able to work or even worse. HEART @CAPS4 or seasons. Hopefully you will listen to @CAPS3 warning, maybe people will start choosing to leave the computer & go have fun and exercise. Reasons why being on the computer too much is bad for you are that your eyes have a really hard time working.

1817,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have bad effects on people, and heres why: they get less exercise, become less social with family and friends, and it is dangerous in many ways. To start, people will most likely get less exercise if they go on the computer often. For example, if you sit in front of your computer monitor all day, chances are you are going to be less prone to wanting to exercise. Also, the outdoors might not compare to what fun you can have on the computer. And lastly, people can get addicted to games that have many levels: @CAPS1 is even a website called addictinggames.com! People might not even leave the computer to get let alone get exercise. As previously stated, computers can promote bad and exercise habits, which can lead to overall bad health. Next, people can become less social due to computers. For instance, you are probably going to end up in your house like a if you go on the computer frequently. And, chances are, you're not going to want to pay attention to your cell phone if someone is trying to text or call you. That can lead to very unsocial behavior. And last, the computer could become your life. Never leaving the monitor, never going outside, and never attending social events you don't want that to happen, do you? As recently said, computers can and will promote unsocial behavior. Finally, @CAPS1 is the dangerous side of computer use. Facebook, myspace & aim people can talk to you and friend request you, and you might say no, and might say yes, but strangers can always contact you either way. People @MONTH1 not know this but if you have a facebook account for long enough, people can look up your first and last name on google and see your profile picture. Its very scary! And to finish, a lot of people these days dont know how to be safe on the computer. They'll accept a friend request even if they dont know the person as previously stated, the computer has a very and dangerous side. To sum it all up, computers promote bad fitness, a bad social life, and it is very dangerous. You wouldnt want that for the people of our town, would you?",9
1818,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @CAPS3 @CAPS4. I got to @ORGANIZATION1 at @CAPS5 society @ORGANIZATION1. Im at @NUM1 year old girl in the @NUM2 grade. Ive benn thinking a lot about how a lot of people who goes on the computer every single day with out doing anything interactive like playing outside with theri friends or having fun with theri families. Alot of people have probably been going on the computer so much that their addicted. ""@CAPS6"" taht is the sound of someone typing on a key board for a computer. Some people all around the world have been hooked going on computer so much that they are becoming lazy and they relly do anything to be active. Like playing a sport or even having a hobbie. I believe the most people who go on the computers the most are teens because they chatsites like @CAPS7 or @CAPS8. I go on such as @CAPS2 but I don't go on them all the time. I know going on the computer is too because you can go on it for homewroks or for projects to look something You can get pictures of someone or soemthing that your researching or type an essay. You can also you in contact with your family on online talking. Computers do teach hand-eye coordiantion because alot of students around the world have had the ability to learn about far away places before. I do believe that computer and negative effect. They say teens spends so much time But what if their homeworks and talking Their are alot of education websites for children do for . effecting on people. Like what in theri something . Some people can . So I think does benefits society if someone thinks not good that .",8
1819,"Dear local newspaper, I understand that people are trying to deside whether or not being on computers is a good thing or a bad thing, and I think that this will help them make their decisions. I think that too much computer is a very bad thing because if people are sitting by their computer all day then they are not getting any exersize. And they are not enjoying nature out in the sun with their friends. One reason why too much computer is a bad thing is that people who sit on their computer all day can not get the exersize that they should be getting. Take my friend @PERSON3 for example, @PERSON3 never had a computer in his house before, he joined all of the clubs at school him and I were on the basketball team and we got a good amount of exersize every day. Now that his parents decided to buy him a computer, he quit all of his clubs and the basketball team, and now he is going obese. He is gaining many pounds every day. But @PERSON3 is not the only one with that problem. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 who are overweight are this fat because they sat by their computer all day. @PERSON1, physical tharapist has met with many obese people and talked about their problem she found out that almost all of them are obese because they do not get enough exersize because they are on the computer too much. Another reason why too much computer is bad is because they are not enjoying nature. Take my friend @PERSON2 for example, she was a great person who loved nature. But when she got her own laptop. She doesnt like to be outside anymore. I asked her if the counted to come to the nature with me and she said that she has a vertual park. on her computer. I tried to tell her that it was not as good as real nature but she said it was better. @PERSON2 isnt the only one with this problem. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 lack nature in their lines if they have a computer. Would you realy only want @CAPS1 to sit at home on their computers rather then enjoy nature? These reasons are why I think that people are getting way too much computer time, they are not getting enough exersise and they are not in the nature with friends enough.",9
1820,"People are or not computers benefit society. Some say that computers are an advancement on technology. I believe that computers are a most of time. People are spending more line on the computer than with family in members and friends. They are spending more time on the computer than exercising, and are not enjoying nature. Computers we just way people to become lazy. When computers out they because for more people to spend their family members and friends. Instead of playing a board games with their family kids and adults just go on the computer to play a game. Computers take away people can be spending with their friends. Now all people do is spend time talking to their friends online instead of playing outside. spending time with this people spend time with family members and friends because of . Researchers say that computers away from the time could be people on the . people the computer typing or playing . There now have jobs computer. Thus can people good . Enjoying a big of peoples lives along. Now you can just nature online rather than going outside and a pictures computers the ability to out pictures. People spend more time on the computer than outside. Nature to people . They would be on the computer. Computers are a big time. Any thing you finding computer you could find somewhere else. Computers away people. Spending time with and enjoying nature",8
1821,"Dear Newspaper, I realize that you are going to make an article on using computers. I personally disagree with the statement that computers are good for you. People are spending too much time on their computers. Internet safty issues, the effecs of computer. My first reason is that people are spending way too much time on computers I know many friends that spend about half the day @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. Satistics show that one out of every @NUM1 child in the @LOCATION1 is spending at least @NUM1 hours everyday on the computer. That's a lot of kids that show there time on the computer. They could be doing many other things during their time. They could be hanging out with frends at the mall or go to another friends because they could be doing fun activities with their parens and siblings. Also insted of sitting around and not doing anything the entire day the person could so ours and play sports like tennis, soccer and other fun athletic spends. If kids would exercise more in the @LOCATION2 we wouldn't have as many fur people as he. Another reason is the problem with internet safty. For example if you have an embarrasing of yourself from @CAPS3 grade and of your friends find it. He or she might post it on his or her facebook account. Then a school bully might see it and starts to tell other kids in your schoool about it through facebook. Those people might start your at school because of it. Another example is that you @MONTH1 have had a bad day in school an freinds, but then you friends stand insalty you. My final reuson is that using a computer for the work could change the you. If you use a computer for a certain amount of time for the right reasons that might be good for your grade, but if you are playing games and with the time of doing your homework or studying your grade with drop. That could effect your future. I think parents should monitor the actions children are taking online because you could prevent child for a grade class. If the parens have set a schedule where the  kidcould have a certan amount of time games or chat online their would be. I think that computers are not good for our society, People spend too much time on the computer. Instance of doing other things you never know what could be happen.

Take a phone for an example A phone @CAPS4 good. It has technology and you can text. That @CAPS4 talking to @CAPS2 @CAPS4 @MONTH1 occur. The effects of technology @CAPS4 that technology @CAPS4 way more handson network and that means that technology, you can email faster than have to type up all the hard work and so when you can do it than everybody can do it too @CAPS3 a result i think that technology @CAPS4 a good thing. Therefore I have set my point. And I think that @CAPS4 all so you should have been good technology or technology shall come to you.",5
1823,"Dear ""The @CAPS1"" I agree with your theory that people spend to much time on the computer, true, you can learn vast knoledge about far away people and places. But if someone were to discover something magnificent, and think ""oh my, I have to create a web page describeing this wonderful place,"" they, at one point in time said ""I should write a book about this"" what I am getting at is that i do not believe that there is anything that is on the internet that we do not have documented in books, the internet can be used for bad purposes, like stalking people, and potential crimes, for example, @CAPS2, people take @CAPS3 quizes and are sometimes giving there password and private information away to strangers. People are also not spending enough time enjoying life if they are cooped up in there house, on the computer. I wanted to hang out with my friend once, he lives in a rural area, and he said it was to cold. It's @NUM1 and I live by the water, you know what he practically said? ""@CAPS4 thanks I wanna sit here and let my life waste away in front of a computer"" People can become so obsesive with electronics these days, the computer is another excuse not to call up your friend, and ask to meet for lunch or a cup of coffee, that is the purpose of computers, but in some cases a computer can be good, and used for good purposes, you can do things that we used to not be able to before computers. I was shown a doctoral website, to show you how to do a knee replacement surgery, and many other kinds of surgerys. They have online @CAPS5 and other animal disections, all these things that could not be accessable without computers, instead of having to drive to work each @CAPS1 and use gasoline, you can work straight from home! So it makes it possible to spend time with your family, set your hours so you can enjoy life, the way life is meant to be spent. But there must be balance, if you want to work at home, you shouldn't spend all your time at home, you need to go out, take a walk, walk your dog(s) or you can hang with a friend! If you live in a city go shopping! Don't spend your life, or most of it locked up in your house, online or not having fan. Those are my thoughts. The internet is used for bad things sometimes, computers can be very addictive, and they can be used for good in some cases, as you can see, or tell, I'm mutual about the internet, those are my opinions, I hope you enjoyed and got a lot out of long paper.",9
1824,"Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 the @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 all @CAPS3 have or more computer. They are used for communication, games and to type reports. But computers have more uses. They can be used to medical research, to improve are environment and to create means @ORGANIZATION1 transportation. Computers, I believe, would be hard to live without. They are used in almost everything. Computer are too valuable to our society; we connect rid @ORGANIZATION1 them. Work in the @ORGANIZATION1 has been impacted by computers significantly. When the computer was introduced robots were disigned to deliver redication to different rooms. There as computers advanced, robots could perform precise surgirirs. Computer also helped the medical industry when they started looking at @ORGANIZATION2. With computers, can see happened @CAPS6 a genetic mutation. Dr. @ORGANIZATION1 recalls. ""The patient had a small bump on his arm. The computer the tissue taken from the . We had the tissue by hand and found nothing wrong. But the computer found a disease."" @CAPS4, people are saved by computers. COmputers are also useful when studying the weather. They have been key in studying global warming environmental scientist has. Computers can continuously record weather patterns and wind speeds. A human would sit next to an instrument a chart and log the reading. Because @ORGANIZATION1 human ever, the recordings would be off. So, the computer is more accurate. Computers in satelites can take pictures @ORGANIZATION1 ice cops. They automatically how fast the ice is melting, and @CAPS6 the speed @ORGANIZATION1 the melting is constant, it can when all @ORGANIZATION1 the ice will be gas. Without computers, environmental studies would be an science. Transportation is also enriched by computers. I remember when my class learned about. We heard bridge that collapsed due to post designing. When wind the blew, bridge could not support that live lead. With computers, bridge engineers can build bridges electronically. Then, they can use simulaters to put forces on the bridge, like traffic, wind and . Shamal @CAPS5 says, ""@CAPS6 this technology had been used to desing that , the would have saved @MONEY1, and @NUM1 lives."" Technology also made cars safer. Traction control and brakes are all controlled by the car's computer. The car can also sense what temperature the inisde is and adjusts to your . So you can have a comfortable ride. Computers are so useful. They are used @CAPS4 in transpotation, the medical field, and in global studies. Without the computer, our society will take a huge step backwards. ",11
1825,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 this as a front page n fad line: ""@CAPS4 suffers from brain damage due to computers!"" computers are a growing phenomenon in the world and each year newer, more advances models are being produced. This, however, doesn't benefit our society like you might think! Due to computers, poeple spend less time excersizing, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends, family, and other citizens. For these reasons, I believe that computers hurt, more than help, our community. To start, people spend far too much time on the computer. Weather it is shopping, playing games, watching movies or even working-it takes up valuable time that could be spent getting exersize! With the growth of computers, obisity issues have grown in the @LOCATION2 as well. Just this year, the @ORGANIZATION1 reported that about three in every five @CAPS5 are overweight. That is a groteque amount of people! on the sublect of @ORGANIZATION1, it has also been discovered that computers can cause eye and brain damage. @PERSON2 helmeg stated, ""@CAPS6, people are spending far too much time on the computers. With not as much exposure to the outdoors and other sources, people are causing long term damage to their eyes and certain regions of their brains."" @CAPS7, as a nation, need to get off the computer and go excersize! In addition to the lack of excersize in our nation due to computers, citizens are not spending as much time enjoying nature. People need fresh air in order to stay healthy! Not only does the outdoors provide fresh air though, but it is a source of beauty and knowledge. Grant @PERSON1, a local senior said. ""I remember my childhood as always being outside. I was never inside longer than absolutely necessary, unlike these days. I learned a lot from the outdoors and it has definatly helped me in life."" @PERSON1 presented a good point too. Having knowledge of the outdoors should be basic common knowledge to everybody in our society. Due to computers thought, the beauty, knowledge and importance of nature is being overlooked and not stressed as much in our country and community. Furthermore, computers create issues with the amount and kind of interaction humans get with one another. On computers, there are many online was to talk weather it is via email, instant message, or video chat, these forms of communication are destroying future generations. This is so because behind a computer, people feel safe. They feel that they can say or act in whatever manner they so choose. This not only leads to bullying, but it can affect the way children and adults interact in person. A recent study conducted by the @CAPS1 youth and family services organization showed that @PERCENT1 of kids are more comfortable communicating with peers on the computer rather than in person. That is a very large amount. If @CAPS7 don't change our use of computers soon, @LOCATION1's future generations could have a huge issue on their hands. All in all, computers have a negative effect on both individuals and our society as a whole. Computers cut into much needed excersize time, limit people's appreciation and exposure to nature, and interfere with social interaction. The next time you support computer use or find yourself logging hours infront of the screen, think of the negative results that occur! Finally, I vehemently improve you to stand up against the over-use of computers in our society and take a stand! Thank you for your consideration to my thoughts.",10
1826,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 position on weather or not computers are good or bad for you is that I agree that they are good for you in someways, for example they teach-hand eye coodination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people,and even allow people to talk online with others. @CAPS2 first explanation is that they teach-hand eye coordination. Computers are good for that because they can be used to teach up or even @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, and @NUM4 year olds how to count, spell, read, it can also teach you how to type, paint, and design on your computer. Next theres how they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Manily most adults use the computer to search for where they had grown up and what type of life they had, if it was a difficult or easy life. They also search for there private getaway or for a family vacation to @LOCATION1 or to @LOCATION2. However most people dis-agree with me bacause most parents are afraid that there teenagers @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not put innapropriate pictures online or @MONTH1 even go on @CAPS3 for example and your child could be talking to a rapist or a sexual abuser that might be lying just to come to your front door and rape you and then kill you. Well to make sure that that never happens to lock inapporiate websites such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 or any other inappropiate website. Last but not least computers also allow people to talk online with othe people. Most teenagers use there comptuer for this also they basically only use it for chat with their friends and/ or even use it to know whats been goin on lately. Most teenagers use @CAPS6 or @ORGANIZATION1 which are basically the samething, most parents dont allow their children to use those websites but there wrong with @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION1 because know rapist or sexual abuser can add you unless they know your screen which makes it impossible for them to add you. Also when you have @CAPS6 or @ORGANIZATION1 you can give your screen name to your friends which they can then add you. You can also block a person when you dont know them.",8
1827,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: @CAPS4 up because what I have to say is extremlly important I am a firm believer that computers have negative effects on people. My first reason why I believe computers have a negative effect on people is because people aren't getting the proper amount of exercise. My second reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because people are going to perminatly damge their eys. My @CAPS7 reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because people aren't spending enough time with their family and friends. In case you @CAPS2't notice, I strongly believe computers have negitive effect on people. My first reason why compuers have a negative effect on people is because people aren't getting enough exercise. People are sitting at home on the computer for the day instead of getting their much needed exercise. Another thing is that the @LOCATION1 has a large amount of obice people living here, so the last thing they need is another exscuse for them not to get their exercise. Stats prove that since computers became increasingly popular, the number of obice people has risen @PERCENT1 from @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT3. As you can see, I believe computers are makeing people spend less time exercising. My second reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because it is doing perminant damge to their eys. I say this because people sit, on average, @NUM1 feet from their screen. Also, the amount of time spent looking at the screen from so close ranges from @NUM2 hours a day. Dr. @PERSON1, an eye doctor who graduated from @CAPS5, says, "" @CAPS6 this amount of time spent on the computer a day is malntained, then by the year @DATE1 their will be a signifigant increase in the amount of blind people. My @CAPS7 reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because they're not spending enough time with their family and friends. I say this because rather than go spend time with your loved ones, people decide it is more important to constintlly check their facebook. For example, instead of going to a family picnic, you decide you have a fantasy football draft in a little while so you skip the picnic. Another thing is that sitting on the computer all day instead of interatcting with your love ones can cause you to loose contact with them and be left all alone. As you can see I strongly believe computer have a negative rather than a positive effect on people because; they cause you to loose exercise, damage your eyes, and they cause you to loose contact with your loved ones. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter.",9
1828,"Dear local newspaper, I agree that people do spend more time on computers than actually doing there studies or even excercising. Also people do spend to much time on computers than they normally spend interacting with there own family an friends. I personally think that people should actually spend more time with there own family an friends more than be on the computers on the time also maybe parents should only let students have a certain amount of time because if students get everything they want all they gona do is always be on the computer. Another reason why people should not use computers so much is because the computers could also be so warned out because people be on them to much. Also on a labtop if it get to hot it can catch on fire. Also if you use the computer so much at a time you can get viruses an then your computer will break i think people spend to much time on computer because maybe there family is not the perfect family there maybe be some problems in a family maybe thats all people wanna do is be on a computer. Maybe a computer is a person's best friend. But then again people could get blind from looking at the screens so much.",7

1830,"Dear Newspaper, I strongly support advances in technology. Not only does a computer help teach hand-eye coordination, but helps others goin knowledge too. It even allows you to interact with others who live far away from you. Most people say sports help people learn hand-eye coordination. Not as many people know that typing does too. Maybe not the @NUM1 - finger crawl, but if people take the time to learn to type correctly, then their aim should improve greatly. This is only one great asset to a computer. If you live here in the @LOCATION2, you probaly don't know much about places like @LOCATION1. To find information on this ice-covered country most people hit the computer. Typing ""@LOCATION1"" on search engines like ""@CAPS1"" is much quicker than paging through dozens of books. You could find the same information with just one click. Sure computers help with hitting the next soft ball, or acing your next history paper. But, what about family or friends who have moved away? Computers can help with that to. Some people fear that kids, and even adults, are spending too much time on the computer. Not enough with family or friend. But, you can connect with them still. Wether it be with someone states away or someone who lives down the street, e-mail and instant messageing servers can help you contact them quickly. I think others should see how important computers can be to daily life. They help teach hand-eye coordination, are quick to find information you need and, help keep close relationship with people who aren't around.",8
1831,"@ORGANIZATION1, In a recent survey, it was discovered that @NUM1 out @NUM2 household in @LOCATION1 own one or more computers. While computers help us look up information more efficiently, they also have negative impacts on ar lives. Computers badly affect humans because they worsen students' academic performance, can be dangerous,a nd make people less healthy. First of all, computers can damage students' education. While computers are helpful to search for information, they can also be abused. Not all websites are appropriate and if a child is supposed to be typing an essay or something, they can easily get distracted on th internet playing games. This can result in a student's grades lowering because they spent more time foolinf arand on the internet than searching for facts relating to a topic in school. Also, students will not learn how to search things the old-fashioned"" way, such as looking for a book in the library using the @ORGANIZATION2. Clearly, computers do more harm than good regarding students' education. Moreover computers can expose people to dangers... With all of the social networking sites nowadays, including @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and instant messaging, it is much easier to contact strangers. My friend @CAPS3-@CAPS4 once went into a chatroom on the computer and began to unknowingly talk to an internet predator. He found out her name and address and came to her house and tried to hurt her. All of this would not have happened if she hadn't entered that chatroom. Even people you know that @MONTH1 not like you can cyber stalk you. As you can see, @CAPS5 information about people is so much easier with computers and some people will abuse that advantage. Additionally, by using computers, people become less healthy. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS6 said that they are less physically active since they bought a computer. This is because with a computer, you do not need to leave your house to find information or be entertained. Instead of walking to the to the library to borrow a book or playing a sport for fun, all you have to do is @ORGANIZATION3 information about a topic or play games online. Furthermore, your eyesight will worsen by by starting at a bright computer screen for hars everyday. By having computers, people's social health also worsen. Instead of having to talk to people face-to-face, you can instant message people. With out a doubt, computers harm yar health physically and socially. In conclusion, computers do not benefit people because students' education is damaged, people can be put in dangerous situations, and yar health can decline. Computers pose as a distraction to students, internet predators can contact you, and you get less physical excersize. I hope you realize that computers do more harm than good.""",11
1832,"Dear Newspaper, ""Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people."" Computers definitely have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, have easy access to information, and at the same time can have fun, and be social. Computer's most definitely should not be a huge concern. Computer's are a big part with helping with hand-eye coordination. If you are playing a game on a i-@CAPS1 and the goal is @NUM1 lap the bubbies that pop up, than the computer will have made it easier is, bubbies quicker. When you are actually on a computer, you can see and tap the keys on the keyboard quicker because of the better hand-eye coordination you have from computers. Another example is if you are in a rush to leave, as soon as you yhour car keys, grab them quicker. This is because of the hand-efe coordination that was improved from computers. This is not the only way computer back effect on people. Computers give easy access to information. For example, if you need to research information on another. Country for homework, than you can your question this a search engine. Also if you are wondering about the lyric can song, you can type in www.lyrics.com into the internet and they will give you the lyrics needed the . If you are in a debate with family about whether or not @CAPS2 is the capital of @LOCATION1, than you can type the question into a search engine. Computers do more than access information easily. With computers, you can also have fun and of social. A way to be social is cheating with an old friend from camp, or from school on www.facebook.com. If you want enteratinment than you can go on www.youtube.com and watch your new and favorite music videos such as @CAPS3 @CAPS4 by @CAPS5, or @CAPS6 @CAPS6 @CAPS6 by @NUM2. If the weather is bad outside, you can always go on www.miniclip.com, to play games. Compters are used for many different reasons; more than just fun and being social. Computers do many things such as help with hand-eye coordination easy access to information, and run and social purposes. Computers have a very positive effect. The only issue is overdosing! the time spend on the computer. If you mange your time wisely so than you do other physical activities, than computers are fantastic!",10
1833,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positive effect on society. In one little machine there is so much you can do. There are ways to communicate with others and even learn new ideas. The computer really is a benefit. One way the computer is a good invention is that it gives people a chance to do things they wouldn't normally experience. For example if a person wanted to see a picture of @LOCATION1, all they would have to do is type it into a search engine. Also, it makes many tasks simpler for people. Typing on @ORGANIZATION1 is much faster than writing out a letter. Plus, all the information you need is right at your fingertips. Not only is a way to learn. Like I mentioned before, the search engine is a useful computer tool. BY typing a key @ORGANIZATION1 onto the screen, lots of information is accessible. Why would anyone take the time to look through a book when it could take five seconds on the computer? Besides having an infinite amount of information, the computer can give an education. Many people today can't afford to attend a college. The computer makes it easier by giving them online courses so they can work during the day. This helps a hardworking person receive the education they deserve. Another way the computer is beneficial to our society is it makes communication easier. For instance, say a student got a detention and his teacher wanted his parents to know. Instead of mailing a letter which could take days, all the teacher would have to do is send an email. You might say, ""@CAPS2't the teacher call?"" @CAPS3 could but what if the student's parents aren't home? EMail is fast and can arrive at it's destination in under a minute. Another way people communicate on the computer is through sites like @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. Each person is able to set up their own profile and look for people they know. With this ability, one person can find people they had met twenty years ago. It's a great way to reconnect with old friends and talk with current ones. In one little box, people can do so much. Life is made easier through programs like email and @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. We are able to do things like go to college, from the privacy of our own homes and communicate and share pictures with old and new freinds. The computer is a machine that effects mankind in a good way.",9
1834,"Computers @MONTH1 be helpful at some times, but they are taking too much valuable time from peoples lives. When people are bored, instead of going outside or doing something productive, they decide to go on the computer. Everything that you do on the computer can be done off of it. Plus, computers @MONTH1 be part of why people are obese. Also, as much as you can talk to friends online it will help you be more social if you didn't talk over the internet. There is more to life that what is on computers. Computers are an easy shortcut to finding the things you desire. Looking for facts for your history project? Go to the library. People in the past didn't have computers, yet they were still smart. You can learn hand-eye cooordination by playing sports, too. Then, you would get your exercise along with it. Although I do agree that is easier to get in touch with people that live far away, you could still do that over the phone. Having trouble with your math homework? Instead of looking up how to do it, like I know I've done many times, go get help from your friend and make a study session. There are plenty of ways to do things that you thought you couldn't do without the computer. How many times have you been on the computer even when it was a beautiful day outside. The computer @MONTH1 be interesting is the world around you. Our obese people percent is becoming larger and larger. I think the computer @MONTH1 be contributing some to this percent. People don't go out for a walk or bike ride as much as they used to. Instead they stay inside and do things like going on the computer. People need exercise to stay healthy. You can't get the exercise you need if you are on the computer. The computer is limiting your social interaction with your peers. Of course on the computer you can talk to them. But, you should be hanging out with them in person. This would boost your social life and let you have fun and enjoy being with friends all at the same time. My friend once told me that sometimes she didn't want to hang out one day even when she had nothing to do. So, she went on the computer. I once read a story in which a girl loved watching tv and because of tv she forgot what she liked and didn't spend as much time doing the things she used to. This is the same as with a computer. People get sucked into them and don't do all the fun things they could be doing like spending time with friends or family. I think that although computers @MONTH1 be helpful sometimes you shouldn't make them a big part of your life. Try to do things without the help of a computer. Go out and get fit and in shape. And, spend less time on the computer and more time outside enjoying your life with friends and family. You can have a life without computers, so go and live it.",10
1835,"Yes, computers are benefits for society. One they help people such as finding stuff in the enternant. Two computers are etertaining. Last but not least you do whatever you want with it.

You could comunicat with family of friends that are away from you like @CAPS1.R. or @LOCATION1. My second reason was that their entertaining. The reason I choose this reason was because computers are good for games and more. For example you sould find games such as racing games or sport games if your into tehm. It has different kinds of games. They also have cool websites. For example @CAPS2.com @CAPS3.com and all sorts of websites. My final is that you could do whatever you want with it. By that I mean that you could got to websites like @CAPS4 thatr you talk to people. Print pictures out for wotk or school work. Anything you want with it, its yours!

Technolgy is bad with @CAPS4 you won't get exercise, but without @CAPS4 you can go out and see nature on vaction and hikes. You can go on far away vacations have fun and exersice like going to the beach and swimming or walking. Also if you go on hikes you will see the buety of nature and you get get exercise. A lot of people today don't go out much because of the computers and get fat so a hike will help them a lot. Computers has a down side because people get addicted to them all the time and get lazy and fat. Nature can get you some ware in life like you can love @CAPS4 and try to save @CAPS4 cause you love @CAPS4 so much. Another thing people could instead of playing with the computer is play a sport. There is a sport for everyone out there to do no matter what @CAPS4 is. Also you can be a dare devil and do crazy stunts like jump a canyon or something like that. A lot of people are that use computer and are still in shape so a lot of people that like computers can do that.

In the world today so many people play sports all the time wether its @CAPS5 or football you are still geting active. To sum @CAPS4 all up computers are bad because they don't give you exersice.

Computars can teach people hand eye coordination which is a very useful in the real world because lots of jobs you to use your hands. Most jobs that envole tecnolegy, its good to have hand eye coordination, but to have good hand eye coordination you'll need practice and some people might become obsessed with the computer and never come off while there practicing there coordination which might led them to forget about important things in life like these family but the easy way to fix that is by giving yourself a get time to be on the computer and that shoud never happen. This nis how hand eye coordination is good and how it won't let you lose track of important things in your life. Also computars can be a good learning expercience, they can teach you about far away places like the collisum in @LOCATION4 or the @LOCATION2's of @LOCATION1 and even the @LOCATION3 rain forest and the tribes that live there. Also the computar can help you book flights so you can go to these wonderful places, plus if you go to these places you'll get a serious workout because you'll be out exploring so you don't got fat and unhealthy from sitting at the computar all day lastly I want to say that the computar can teach you about far away and give you a lote of back on them too. this is another reason how the computer can benifit us. Lastly the computar ca allow to have a long distance conversation with people. talking with people, even one's around the world is good because everyone needs to talk to someone now and then, yet sometimes talking can get out hand which what I mean is you'll be on for so long that you'll forget what the outside of your room look's like and what nature is, like I said talking can be good but don't do it every day for the rest of your life because its good to go out for, enjoy nature, even garden this why the computar is good for communication not just because you can talk to you @CAPS1 penpal but so you can learn more about the cultures os the world. That is why the computar is a good and important part of our socity, it can teach us hand eye coordination, teach us about for away places, and even let us talk to people that are on the other part of the globe that why the computars is good even though it can com some our lives but there past that, that is why the computar is important to our society.",9
1838,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2; I am writing to you for the debate on wether computers help or break people down. I do think they break use down but they do help us in so many ways. On a computer most people will think about going on websites of games. There is more to it than that. Our technology is so advanced that people who use computers can talk via text chat online or a live webcam chat, they make it so we dont always have to drive somewhere and waste gas. The following paragraphs will show why computers are great to use. The way we take care of ourselves. If most people eat and eat constantly what good does that do for them? They need to know @CAPS4 they need to excercise and should do it daily. People do get addicted to computers but that doesnt meen they cant excercise. This @MONTH1 sound weird but @CAPS4 we type a lot of fact we build strength in our hand-eye cordination. The internet also could teach us new ways to exercise not just us running around. Our hands actually get stronger @CAPS4 we type due to the amount of times we use them constantly @CAPS3, @CAPS3 is an excercise. Secondly a computer can prepare kids for future carrers in offices, @CAPS4 we type we memorize where the keys are so soon enough we can not even look at the keyboard @CAPS4 we type. We can also use computer and take college classes and graduate through the internet for people who cant aford to go to a college university. The internet is a great resource for many things, one of the things is to learn another language so you can communicate with other people around the world. We can also learn how to do things due to website youtube. You can upload anything on the website and become viral over the internet and show off you own content. The internet has websites that can help you select future jobs, display you own stuff, or just view many things. Last but not least the internet has websites like facebook that will let you interact with your friends or family members who accept a request from so you never meet any strangers or can get harmed either way. Its a easier way to communicate father than driving to meet someone or hogging the house phone. The computers come with so many features that make everyone who uses a computer a lot easier to use. They now make touchsmart computers and wireless mouses. A computer is not just for us to have fun on. It teaches us subjects in depth. Its great to have a computer because you can learn about different subjects, you can interact with other people around the world, or you can prepare youreself. for a future job. Computers are not bad at all they do things for us that we could never think of computer are great to own.",10
1839,"I think that computers have a positive effect on people. I say this because they help out a lot. They have many diffrent capabilities. Read on to find more on why I think that computers have a positive effect. My first reason is that people can communicate with friends they havent seen in a long time. This is a good thing because if you lost contact with a friend you could find him on the internet. Also you can keep touch with friends and family if they go to far places to see to see how they're doing. Lastly, you can keep in contact with pepole you havent seen in years. This is why I think that computers have a positive effect on people. My @CAPS1 reason is you can write stuff and type it into the computer. I think this is good because what if a person has messy handwritting and they have to write something for their job. They can just type it into the computer and and print it and it out neat. Also you can send letters to through the computer. This is another reason why I think that computer a positive effect on people. You should agree with me on this. My last reason uis that if you have a computer you can actually play games that can make you think faster and you can also by things of the internet instead of going to be store. Like if the store ran out of the thing you wanted you could buy it online and stil got it on time. Ang the gmaes @CAPS2 talking about are mind games and prizes that make think harder. Also you actually go to college through the computer. These are my final reasons that i think computers have apositive effect on people. I think you should agree with me and I hope you will computers have a positive effect on people. I dont really se a negative effect that comes out of them. Accept for when hackeers try to hack into your computer. so agree with me and my reason on how computers have a positive effect on people.",8
1840,"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. In my opinion, I think computers do benefit society. For an example, if you need to know of search for something you can look it up. The computer most likely will have what you're looking for (@CAPS1 search engine is @ORGANIZATION1). You can keep in touch with a person no matter how far away. Also, being on the computer doesn't have to take time away from nature and family. First of all, there's so much knowledge on a computers. It has mostly every topic you can think of. This can benefit in various ways. For an example, if you want to know about a medical issue/problem, you can find it. People that are in school no matter what grade, it helps if you look up the subject to get numerous resources. Over all, probably one of the most common things to do on the computer is shopping. Instead of leaving your home, mostly every greatly known store has their own website. Sometimes, even minor stories have a website. Computers are great in knowledge and searching. Secondly, computers are great to communicate, @CAPS2 someone @MONTH1 live a very for distance from where you are, you can always keep in touch. There's chat rooms, webcam, email, networking sites, and more all over the web. Why keep adding to your phone bill, using your minutes, or hope for a signal when you could just use the simple computer? computers are a smart way to communicate. Lastly, computers aren't the ones who take time away from family, exercise, or enjoying nature. The amount of time used on the computer is up to you. It doesn't have to be an everyday thing using the computer nor does interacting with family. Exercising, and enjoying nature. You could always fit in time for both or you could just use the computer when you necessarily need to. Using the computer doesn't harm your time with family, exercise, and nature. In conclusion, in my strong opinion, I think a computer benefits society. Computers can be used for search engines for knowledge and shopping/bargaining. They're also great for communication. Lastly, computers never really take time from your family and friends, exercise, or nature. That's all up to you. Therefore, I see that computers really benefit society rather than waste it.",9
1841,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion about the effects of computers on people is that computers have good effects on people. One reason is computers have good effects on people because when you need to look something up online for home work. Another is that computers have good effects on people because if you want to chat or talk with a friend online you can if you have a computer. Lastly if you are going on vacation and you need directions to go to the place you want to got you. Just look them up. First, computers have good effects on people because when you need to look something up online for homework. If you try finding something online like a definition for a word you will find it. If we did not have computers we would not be able to find things for homework that easy. We would have to look through a lot of books just to find it. Second, computers have good effects on people because if you wan't to chat or talk with your friend online you can if you have a computer. You can ask your friend what your homework was if you forgot. If you were absent from school on like a @DATE1 you can ask a friend online what you missed in class and what they did in school while you were gone. Finnaly, if you are going on vacation and you need directions to go to the place. Were you want to go to you can just look them up. If you look them up you will find directions really fast. It's better to look up directions because you will not get lost. If you don't look them up you will got lost. @CAPS1 opinion is that the effects of computers on people is good one reason @NUM1's that computers have good effects on people because when you need to look something up online for home work. Another is that if you want to chat or talk with one of your friends online you can if you have a computer. Lastly, if you are going on vacation and you need directions to where you want to go you can just look them up. That's why I think computers have a good effect on people.",8
1842,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 is quite obvious that computers are in fact a benefit for the society, and they are convenient when keeping in touch, but in my opinion, computers are beginning to have a negative effect on people. They are affecting people mentally, physically, and they're also having an impact on people's safety. People need to unplug the hard drive and start living life unplugged. We've all heard the term before, a 'couch potatoe!' @CAPS2 pretty much the same for a computer except a 'desk potatoe'. When people use the computer @CAPS1 has various negative physical effects on them. The more time people spend online, the less they can excersise, play outside and just enjoy nature. Computers keep people from going outside and excersising. The more computers we use, the bigger we're going to get. You're not gonna burn any calories sitting on the couch with your laptop. You can only get so much excersise from typing or moving a mouse. @CAPS1 also effects you physically when @CAPS1's pulling you away from your friends. Most @MONTH1 say you can still stay in touch with facebook, or myspace, but is that really friendship? You can't make any plans to do anything with your buds if all you're doing is sitting at the computer. Computers are having a negative effect on people's physical health. You know the term addicted right? @CAPS2 when there's one thing you cannot stop thinking about. That one thing that's always on your mind. This addiction is common when @CAPS1 comes to computers and technology. All day, all you can think about is getting a message on facebook or adding more tweets to your twitter. You are dependent on the website and technology. First thing you do when you get home is turn on your laptop. Computers are effecting people's imental health as well. They seem addictive. We've all been warned haven't we. Peop come to give speeches about @CAPS1, schoold constantly ramble abut @CAPS1 and that thing in internet awareness or sacety. Everyday, more than @NUM1 predators turn on their computers just searching for their next victims. This is a very serious negative effect that computers have on people. @CAPS1 seems so easy for one to fall in the trap of an internet predator. All @CAPS1 takes is one friend request, and they have a chance of you being their next victim. But predators are not the only things there's also virus. Virus all start with a ""@CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1."" @CAPS1 is an ad or a saying you'll win a free ipod or something. And once you click on that @ORGANIZATION1, they're got you. Put in some personal information, they've got you even more. Virus and scams like that are major disadvantages to having a computer. So without internet awareness, your safety could be effected. Computers aren't having the best effect on people. @CAPS1 affects your physical and mental health, along with bad effects on your safety. @CAPS2 time for @CAPS5 to smash the hard drive and trash the laptops, then get outside and enjoy life, computer free.",11
1843,"Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you want your children spending all day, everyday on the computer rather than spending time with you? I sure wouldn’t like that! Spending too much time on the computer can get you in trouble. It can also strain you eyes from staring at the screen. Also, you want get any exercise while on the internet. I'm writing this letter to convince you that spending all day on the computer does not benefit society. First of all, many kids in middle school and high school have myspaces or facebooks. If you spend all day on those websites you can get into a lot of trouble. Kids dont realize what they type can be available to anyone. They should be aware of what they're typing, but just to make sure, the parents should monitor them. Many people spend all day on the computer talking to friends and end up using inappropriate language. This can get them into a lot of trouble so they are better off spending time with family and friends. Do you the fact of having wear glasses fromstaring at a computer? Many people dislike glasses and if they stare at the computer screen, especially at night, they eventually will need them. Even switching from screen to screen and playing games hurts my eyes! If you staring at your computer screen. If it gets so bad, maybe glasses won't even help. Even though chatting with friends & family, playing games and watching videos on @CAPS2 is fun, you don't want to be a couch potatoe and gain weight. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teens said that they knew a friend/family member who doesn't exercise at all and is always on the computer. If we prove that you won't be healthy after a week of computer, this ratio will go down by a lot. Enough of the @ORGANIZATION2's or videos about losing weight, just get off the computer and do fun activities outside! This @CAPS1 be great if we can stop people from gaining weight without surgery, medication, or videos, right?! I suggest you have an article on how computers can affect your weight and it's not good for you. In conclusion, I believe that looking/being on a computer all day will not hurt yourself, but hurt you family & friends. It'll help you stay out of trouble, be glassless, and be very energetic and healthy. Being on the computer and in a while is okay but not @NUM3. It's sort of like the cellphone now.",10
1844,"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I believe that computers have a great effect on people. One reason I think that is because if you are a loner, a computer can make you have friends. Second reason if you are bored you can go on a learning site on the computer. And the third reason computers will keep you upgraded. Computers have websites that you can meet people on like @CAPS3, facebook, and twitter. If you are a loner and really just need a friend the computer can get you that. Also if you start to talk to people on the computer you never know they could turn out to be that special someone in your life. Computers are a also great learning tool it has websites that can teach you math, social studies, @LOCATION1, and science. Also the computer is a tool its self if you know how to use a computer that can help you in the long-run if you need a job. I say that because now an days you need a computer for some jobs so if you know how to work a computer your good to go. Also if you want to be cool like your kids and not feel left out a computer is the way to go. Computers are so upgraded everyone either wants one or has one. And if you were always lefft out or for some reason felt that way @CAPS4 tellin you set a computer. Now I hope you read this carefully because computers will put a smile on any ones face. Always remember computers have websites you can meet people on also they have great learning sites and last but not least you will be upgraded. That is all I have to say for now.",7
1845,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 do you find out what's happening all over the world, or find answers to your urgent questions? The @ORGANIZATION1 can help you do this and more. With computers, people can quickly find the information they need, discover what's going on in the world, and connect to others. Computers have greatly benefited us. I can't tell you @CAPS1 many times I've used the computer to @ORGANIZATION1 for school. You can find out almost anything online. Are you concerned whether your headaches are serious? You can find out what your symptoms mean without having to leave the room. Do you need advice? There are people all over the world who can help you. You can also get information quickly. Just search what you want, click a link, and you're there. Computers allow people to easily get information. @CAPS1 would you know if there was an earthquake in @LOCATION1? You have to wait to watch the news, but on the @ORGANIZATION1, you can find out what happened in half an hour. According to @PERSON1, of the @ORGANIZATION1, major events such as a disaster or a celebrity's death, for example, are mostly posted online within an hour and a half. People can also learn about minor events that wouldn't be on the news, but are important to them. I was not able to attend the most recent @CAPS2 dancing championship, but I found out @CAPS1 my friends were doing by following a blog. The @ORGANIZATION1 keeps people in the know. The @ORGANIZATION1 is a great place to connect. You can see @CAPS1 your friends or family are doing with blogs, social networking sites, and more. You can meet new friends on forums, too. You don't have to call and hope your friend is at home. You can e-mail them all that you want to say. When my mom joined @CAPS3, she found her old highschool friends. They planned a reunion, and now they meet up all the time. With computers, we can keep up with old friends and meet new ones, too! Computers have changed our lives for the better. With them, we can get almost any information, know what's happening around the world, and stay in touch with family and friends. Don't you think they've made life a lot easier?",8
1846,"Computers are a relitity new invention, a some-what complicated one with plus-rides and down-rides.. Some don't like the @CAPS2 because they think it's causing people to become lazy. But at this point, @CAPS2 aren't the only thing that causing their, theres, this, video games, cell phones and I-pods. @PERCENT1 of students in grade @NUM1 admit that they have one or more of the items listed above. Computers can bread, get and bunch of other things @CAPS1 of course, someone has to fies it, and the builder can't fie everything. There are jobs for living computers and all of @CAPS2 - related things. With jobs bing on low battery, use need extra job. With computers, you can look up pretty much anything, @CAPS1 if you need help with your job, homework or even just looking up a phone number, you can use the @CAPS2 for. @CAPS1, as i've said computers are a great",6
1847,"Dear @LOCATION1, I am writing to you because I think computers are very helpful. They make it easier by providing more history, it has a lot more information than books do and when you need to get in touch with someone, its easier. With all these great ideas, you will see the perspective that I do. First, having computers helps when your researching history. About @PERCENT1 of the school say that when they are looking for history, there is more information on the computers. When we ask a teacher about history, they only know what they were taught. But on the computer, there are people all over the world that tell us what they learned. So, we get more information about history than what our teachers know. Secondly, computers are very helpful because they have more information than books do. I recall a time when I was doing a report on slavery, and when I was looking at information in a book, but there wasnt enough. So, I went on the internet and searched slavery and it gave me way more information then I needed. Computers are faster that flipping through the pages of a book. It would take two minutes to search it online, but if you had to look through a book, it could take hours. Being able to search for information online, would help get my work and your's done faster, by providing more information. Lastly, computers are very helpful because its easier to communicate with people. What if you didnt have a cellphone, how would you get in touch with a family member? You would go online and send them a email or talk to them on a chat. Having to get into touch with a friend or family member is very important to me, and @CAPS1 pretty sure you too. Computers make it easier to communicate with friends and family members. In conclusion, me and a lot of other people have a strong opinion about computers. They help us in many ways such as helping with researching history, has more information than books and makes it easier to communicate with people. Without a computer, life would be so complicated. I hope after you reading this, helps you to see how helpful they really are.",8
1848,"Dear @PERSON1 of the @CAPS1, I would like to say the computers do not benefit the society. Computers do not help people in the world today because computer take part in obesity. Kid dont want to time with family and @CAPS5 don’t work to do homework. First, computers now a days a big hit on obesity. I on the shows @CAPS5 exercize. @CAPS5 dont want to go out and exercize because they would rather be on instant messaging there friends. Who wants to go outside in the cold @CAPS2 you can have and go on the internet or I send that almost @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 citizens health has gone because of computer @CAPS2 children or @CAPS3 have computer they don't eat or sleep night. If they are on the computer people to eat and People also @CAPS4, computers take away tiime. Computers live families. Seeing that the children computer movies I tell her no I can always watch it on youtube. Finally, @CAPS5 are dropping and they arent @CAPS5 ont do their homework because they are busy on the computer @CAPS2 they come home they have to change there myspace of facebook @CAPS5 now a days have to talk to friends online then do homework. @CAPS2 I come home I go straight to the computer. I pick the computer instead of homework, because computers are easy to do. Homework is the most hardest and thing ever. Yesterday my eacher told me that I was failing then I was going on the and I yes so I might not graduate becaue of the computer. Well head of the @CAPS1 I hope that you take my opinion into consideration. Please remember this can be a good help @CAPS2 your @CAPS5 grow up.",7
1849,"I think that computers have the good effects on people. With a computer, you can have social interactions with people far away, if not even a friendship. Through the internet you can find people intrested in the same kind of things that you are. You can learn about different cultures and tell about yours. For example @PERSON1 likes to play guitar, but where he lives, there's no other people intrested in the same thing. From the internet he can a large guitar community, where he can share advices and tips with other people. He has also plenty of new friends, that he found from the netsite. Also what @PERSON1 hasn't noticed is, that his typing has gotten better. Typing is a very important in your life, if you are thinking business education or you dream about being, for example, a @CAPS1. You get better in controlling your extremeties like, for example, @PERSON1's playing has gotten better. Computer is a good way to learm new things and search an information. When I had health in my school, the theacher was suprised. ""@CAPS2 do you know so many things"", she asked, I haven't thought about the answer before. So @CAPS2 did I know all these things? From the internet of course, I realized. When you surf in the internet or you search something else, you bump in to another information. Also from internet site communities you learn from other people's experiences. When you use computer you have there many useful programs like for ex the @ORGANIZATION1. My friend, for example, loves to write and is dreaming about the job of a @CAPS1 or an author. She writes a lot on her leisure time but she doesn't have to buy a writing machine besides in addition to paper, ink and dictionary. This develops her writing skills and ability to write as she loves to do. So using computers helps people learn and it develops their social skills and emotional health. It stimulate you to do what you love (like playing guitar for example) And that's why I support using computers and believe that computers have good effects on people. ",9
1850,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are a neccesity to this world. Without computers people wouldn't be able to catch up on news or maybe sports games they missed. Computers are also needed to interact with friends or family that you haven't seen for a while. The last reason why computers are needed is because they help with hand eye corrodination. These days news is a major priority to everyone. Without computers people wouldn't know that @LOCATION1 just got hit by a major earthquake and more than @MONEY1@NUM1 people died. Computers help with keeping people updated. With donations from the computer people have already donated @MONEY1 to @LOCATION1. A few days ago @ORGANIZATION2 killed one of this trainers and there is a major conterversy on whether or not he meant it or it was an accident. I knew all that information from ore website on a computer. Without these machines nobody will know what is going on daily in the world. Computers also include many features like facebook, @CAPS1, e-mail, myspace and more. All of these things help you stay connected with friends and family. So, maybe if you forgot who's house you're celebrating the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 at you can just go to your computer and check! Every once a while you feel like you're missing something for an event, well the great thing is that you can go on your computer and ask a friend. The last reason why computers aren't a bad thing is they help with hand eye corrdination. Whenever you're @CAPS4 up a paper you try not to look days at yourself @CAPS4 so then you can follow along with yourself: This really helps with hand eye corrdination. The @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""@CAPS4 a paper helps with you're hand eye corridination @PERCENT1 more than throwing a football."" You can also play games on a computer which also helps with hand eye corridination. In conclusion, having computers helps this world more than it hurst it.

1851,"Dear Local Newspaper, Some people @MONTH1 be concerned with all of the time being spent on the computer, but I think they have a good effect on us. People can do @CAPS7 things on the computer like research @CAPS1 projects, and get to learn new things, you can interact with people from all over the world, and some people that have sickness causing them not to speak have certain programs on computers to help communicate with others. So, don't you think computers are a good advance on technology? First, people can research projects, and get to learn @CAPS7 things, @CAPS1 example, if you get a history project and have to research a president, you can just type in the name and tons of information will pop up. Morgan from @NUM1 grade says, ""I do all my school projects on the internet. It is a very good source and sometimes I look things up just @CAPS1 fun, and learn something new everyda."" @CAPS2, computers might not have the answer to a question you need @CAPS1 a project, but statistics say it will have about @PERCENT1 of the other information you @MONTH1 need. Isn't it great that we have computers? Second, you can interact with different people from all over the world. There are @CAPS7 sources you can do that through like @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, and even @ORGANIZATION2. Say you go on a vacation like a cruise, and you meet some people that you became friends with. You can stay in touch with them through the internet. @PERSON1 from @NUM2 grade says, ""I went on a cruise @DATE1, and I made @CAPS7 friends. But, there are @DATE1 girls that I still keep in touch with through @CAPS4. I talk to them usually when I get home from school."" Computers are a great thing to have so you can keep in touch with others. Lastly, people that have sickness that cause them to not speak have computers to communicate with their family. Three @DATE1 @DATE1, my neighbor had a severe stroke that kept him paralyzed, and only allows him to move his eyes up, down, and side to side. A doctor told them their is a program called @CAPS6, which has the patient line his eyes up on a certain phrase, and the computer will speak @CAPS1 him. He can also spell things out, and you can have some communication. It is a great thing to have, so the family can have a way of speaking to him. It's amazing to have advanced technology @CAPS1 these reasons, don't you think? As you can see, I think that computers have a great affect on people. Some reasons I think this are you can do research @CAPS1 projects, and learn new things, you can interact with different people from all over the world, and people that have sicknesses who can't speak have programs on the computer that helps than communicate, @CAPS7 people could disagree with me, but I think computers are great to have.",10
1852,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 the computers have an effect on those people, they should excrise nad look or explore nature, but my opinion for some people would be go on the computer for an hour or just limit the time, yes I know its fun but you still have to stay fit, smart and healthy. Being on the computer is not good for your brain. We should limit computer time for adults and kids. The effects that the kid have are possible. The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 in their brains are not as develope as adults. So yes it would be hard to get them off but show them how fun it can be off the computer. You should be getting fit moms and @CAPS4. Also take a rest and eat a healthy snack or at on that new tredmill you bought last @DATE1. Another reason why you should with the time cause who has to pay the bill cause I know that every time when the mail coms the bill come also and nobody like to pay bills. Mom and @CAPS4 I definitly think you should limit the kids computer time because there are inapropreate stuff that they might be looking at and all those websites that they are on they could be talking a chating to anybody thats very dangerous so give your kids the heads up. Show them how pretty flowers look in the @DATE2 or how bugs store food or just take the to the zoo and show the new bears hibernate. There fore the parents I know how you need to look up stuff an the computer but that great but the computer is not always right so just pop open a book once in a while its great you know so parent and was limit your time and do something like water rafting with the whol family. Have some fun and get shoe eyes off the screen and the fingers of the keyboard and go have fun.",8
1853,"Dear local Newspaper, I agree with computer experts that computers poison the brain. These are some reasons why computers ""poison"" the brain: Computers can blood shot your eyes, and make your vision blurry. People are on the computer all the time they don't get a chance to exercise. The more time your on the computer, less time you spend with your family and friends. One way, that computers are bad for you because, your eyes get all blood shot when your on the computer for so long. Your vision gets all blurry and messed up, after you leave the room you bump into things and get hurt. Staying on the computer to pull off all nighter is bad for your eyes as well because when your mom, dad, brother or sister opens the blinds the sun light would blind you. Another reason why computers are bad for you because, people are on the computer all the time they don't have time to exercise. People who are on the computer @NUM1 hrs a day aren't going outside enough get fresh air, play sports, etc. instead of playing computer games. Computer games are fun once in a while, but go outside and run around for once. A final reason why computers are bad for you because your spending less time with your friends and family. Instead of @CAPS1 your friends, go talk to them in person for once. Watch a movie with your parents, hang out with your brother, go shopping with your sister. Do something instead of being on the computer all day. All in all these are the reasons that are ""poisoning"" or ""rotting"" the brain of human society.",8
1854,"The question everyones asking is, should we spend less time on the computer. I think we should spend less time because excersise, talk to people in person, and learn new things, and I will explain why. When your on the computer you lose time to excersise. Without excersise you will be out of shape and wont be able to play any sports. At one point you will be skinny but if you dont do nothing and eat all day, you will become fat. Excersise helps you get your nutrition up more. You should excersise with friends so you dont have to be bored by yourself. At the end of the day when ur done then you can go one the computer. Several websites you can talk to friends. For example: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1 and others more. But talk to them through @CAPS3 when you can talk to them in person. When ur bored at home call a friend and hang out and play some sports. Also if you have a special somebody in your life you would want to spend time with he/she. Why meet new people online when you meet them face to face. You could get to know them better and later you could have a trust worthy friend. When you need to use the internet is when you have homework. Why just look it up on google and read a book about it. Sometimes the things on the internet is false information. In math read what you have to do instead of using the @CAPS4 and finding the answers. People cant alway rely on the computer, sometimes you just need to learn it on you own. In games people want to use cheats and it's just not fun if you dont play fairly. I strongly recommend that for now everyone who has a way to get on a computer, should spend less time and have fun with nature.",8
1855,"Dear readers of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people have been makeing a big fuss about computers. Some people think that computers are bad and we should get rid of all of them. Me I completely disagree with them. I feel computers are a new and amazing technology. They help out so much in dayly life. For example say you ar doing a report for work you can go online and use resources to find more information about the topic of the report. Say you also have bad handwriting what will you do? You would go to a computer an type your report. I agree with some people that some people spend too much time on the computer. But there are more positive things about the computer than they are negitive, for example a positive is going on google and looking up information and learning newthings. A negitive would be people spending too much time on computers. All that im trying to say is that computers are wonderful things and that it is such a privlige to have computers. I think its great we have computers in our world.",7
1856,"My opinion for computers are that I do support the computers. Here are the reasons why, they are eduational for us kids. They are faster than books and they have a lot more information. And the last reason is because it has more opportunities for a lot more things. Let me explain more. The reason why I say that it is more educational is because of these reasons, they have very good websites for us to learn more, like funschool.com. That website helps you with every subject that you need help on. Another reason why I say it is education is because it helps you do essays or reports and if you need more information on what to do you can go on different websites and get exacly what you need. Like one day we had a @CAPS1.@CAPS1 project on @LOCATION1. Nobady new what @LOCATION1 was like. So kids went on diffrent websites and fond a lot of information for the project. The secon reason was faster, and the reason why I say that is because you can communicate with other people in different places faster. For example my cousin @CAPS2 is living in spane. And he also does not have a cellphone or a house phone. So when he can he goes on his yahoo and if my mom and I are on we able to talk to him. Another reason is because you are able search more things. Like if you have missed a talent show of yor family you are able to see it on the internet. The last reason was because",7
1857,"Dear newspaper editor, Computers are used all around the world daily. The computer is the main thing in our society. One reason why I think so is that computers have a lot of knowledge. One other reason is you can chat with family and friends. My last reason is they help people learn. In these paragraphs, you will see why I think so. My first reason is computers have a lot of knowledge. On computers, you can search any question and get your answer. For example, say you put, ""@CAPS1 to make muffins,"" the computer will say @CAPS1 to make them. They know almost every answer. That is my first reason why computers are the main thing in society. My second reason why computers is the main thing in society is you can chat with family and friends. My one can chat on a computer. I chat with all my friends on the computer. It is really easy to do. That is my second reason why computers are the main thing in society. My last reason why computers are the main thing in society is they help people learn. People are able to go to school on computer. Have a college degree on computers. Even people work on computers that is my last reason why computers are the main thing in the society. Now you can see @CAPS1 computers are the main thing in society. Hope you agree.",7
1858,"Dear Local Newspaper, @LOCATION1- @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1. I am an @NUM1 grade student at @ORGANIZATION1. I think that @CAPS5 should have computers because people can learn a lot of far away things. People have a lot of fun times playing games writting and even chatting online. Everyone loves to have computers, so lets not take it away. IPI - @CAPS2 far away new things is really great of people something it us books, why not check the internet. Internet is faster way to search things. They should have time to be in the computer, doing there homework and having a lot of fun. Computers are expensive and not easy to get, but its sure easy to search for things looking for. Computers effect people a lot but its okay let us have free time. @NUM2 @CAPS3, chatting online over the internet that sounds cool. That effects people a lot because that is taking away time to do and taking bad chances when online. I don't want to have computers it keep going with that. For during homework its all right because you can type and of writing it in a piece of paper that would take forever. Computers but it sometimes. It affects people inn some ways. @NUM3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 take away computer people think that people hate that and would not be on work. They will be with out people don't want to be searching threw books all the time, it gets trying. Please don't late affects us a alot. Conclusion - @CAPS5 do believe that computers affect other. Please local newspaper @CAPS5 are telling you the truth.",9
1859,"Dear local newspaper, I agreed that computers have a positive effect on people. In this paragraph your going to learn about @CAPS1 computers are a positive effect, @CAPS1 does @CAPS5 help people, and @CAPS5 even allows people to talk online with other people. Do you want to know @CAPS1 computers are a positive effect? First, @CAPS2 way computers are a positive effects is @CAPS5 gives you more knowledge. For example, stuff you didn't know before you know now because you looked @CAPS5 up on the @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS3 way computers are a positive effect is you can keep in touch with your family @CAPS6 your on a vacation or at a job. On the other hand many people without computers cant keep in touch with their family then, @CAPS3 way computers are a positive effect is because @CAPS5 helps many people with their jobs. For example, cops use computers to look at peoples files and their past criminal record. Last, @ORGANIZATION1's help you learn different type of launguages. Have you ever thought about @CAPS1 computers help people? First, @CAPS2 way @CAPS5 helps people is @CAPS5 organizes stuff for them. For example, none of your work will get lost and you know where you saved @CAPS5. Second, @CAPS5 also helps learn about new places and history. For example, @CAPS6 your trying to learn about china's history you can do that un the @ORGANIZATION1. Next, @CAPS3 wat @CAPS5 helps people is @CAPS5 has the ability to order stuff online from far away places. Finally, computers also help people by introducing new and fun things to them. For example, their is many games online that make the @ORGANIZATION1 also fun and not boring. Many people agree that talking online over the @ORGANIZATION1 is fun. First, @CAPS2 way @CAPS5's fun is because you meet new people you havent known before. Second, @CAPS3 way talking online with other people is fun because you get to learn more stuff about that person and his/her cultur. Next, @CAPS6 also gives a chance for the people that dont have friends make some over the internet. Last, @CAPS5 also helps you talk to your family that lives in @LOCATION1 or even further. Have you ever thought of a @ORGANIZATION1 having positive effects? @CAPS6 you did, why dont you mension some stuff in your essay like I did for example, @CAPS1 computers are positive effects, @CAPS1 @CAPS5 helps people, and @CAPS5 even allows people to talk online with other people.",10
1860,"Dear people of @CAPS1, Have you ever thought about how many people in @CAPS2 are fat or obaes? Of how many hours they spend playing on the computer instead of exerciseing? What some people don't mind this lifestyle of no exercis, not seeing nature, and no friends or family to keep company with, I do not agree with this lifestyle. Imagin a hom of a bird, the dew on the grass, or the sound of the trees getting blown. Don't you just love the relaxing sounds and sights of nature? People who play on the computer say: this is the only world I kneed, and don't take the time to smell the roses. I took a survay and @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people said they would rather stay in and play video games instead of watch the clouds or do something outside. Now imagin this you have not seen light in over a week, what happens when you need to go out... you'll get blinded by the sun. Also not only is nature a great place to relax but @CAPS4 you don't go out in the sun a lot it could have servire conquense on your body, like your skin turns pale, your imune situm weakends, and you gain weight fast. Now think about this do you want your kids or do you want to look like some fat, pale person who is sick all the time? Imagin this you sit at the computer all day and all you eat is fast food, and you get up to walk around or do any kind of exercise. Does that sound fun to you? Some people who play on the computer waste almost @PERCENT1 of there day playing a game on the computer. I asked a person who usto send that kind of time on the computer he said |""I to spend so much time on the computer I forgot all about what my body needed. When i tried to get up one day and could not, that's when it hit. I need to do more for my body, I needed to take better care of it."" @CAPS3 now gotton back to his feet and fells way netter than he ever has. he thinks that spending almost @PERCENT1 of your day on the computer is a waste of time for all who do it or are thinking of doing it. Imagin you stuck in a box with no friends only a computer as your company. What would you do? Most gamers do this and end up lossing very dear friends or family members to this. I asked ex-gamer @PERSON1 about this, all @PERSON1 said was ""I think that it wastes perious time with your family. I almost missed my daughter frist steps because of this adtion. I also almost lost all of my best friends."" @CAPS4 you enjoy the smell and sight of nature, you care about your body, and you dont want to lose perious family time or friends. Then I sugest you vote yes to putting a band on compers.",9
1861,"Dear @PERSON1, I think that the advancing of computers and technology are a good thing. I think so because computers teach good hand-eye coordination, are a good source for research and lets you comunicate with people no matter how far away. So lets a take a good look at how computers give us a hand. I think computers are very helpful in life. I think this because they teach good hand-eye coordination.""@CAPS1 who have hand-eye coordination have a better chance at doing well in sports which is a great way to stay fit,"" says @PERSON3 of @CAPS2 view @CAPS3. High. I agree with @ORGANIZATION1's statement because how would you be able to play baseball without hand-eye coordination. For example, my friend chose uses the computer alot and is the star of the basball team.This is because you need good hand-eye coordination to be able to swing the bat while your watching the hall come at you. next i would like to help you learn about why the computer is so helpful. Say you one doing a project and you need some information you just can't find in the books. Where do you turn? The computer. ""@CAPS4 it comes to research the internet is the way to go"" says @PERSON2 of @ORGANIZATION2,"" @CAPS5 whore my most successful graduates found most of their research. More than @PERCENT1 of students use internet research daily. Would you want you children to be well educated with updated technology? Now I would like to talk to you about why I think the computer is important. My final reason I think computers are very useful is because it is a great way to comunicate with computers it is a easy to talk to people all over the world with no charge. For example @CAPS4 my mom wants to talk to my grand parents in @LOCATION1 she just uses the computer instead of running up the phone bill @PERCENT2 of americans use the ineternet as a form of communication. SO finally I think that the advancing of computers would be good since we rely on them so much. Since they are so important to improve hand-eye coordination, help with research, and comunicate would you want then outdated?",9
1862,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I absolutly agree that people are spending way to much time on the computer, and spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family of friends. It just would be better for everyone to get out of the house, instead of sitting in front of the computer all day. People need to enjoy life. If everyone was just sitting in front of the computer all day, they will never enjoy life around us. People need to just walk outside and see nature. If they can't do that, they could exercise. Whenever I need to calm down, or even when I get mad at my parents, I go upstairs to my room and do some yoga. It relaxes me, we all should do this, too. A perfect example is when I was watching @PERSON1. I didn't want to put my mom made me. There was this women and she was so adicted to the computer. She has a part time job and barely feeds her kids. She would give her kids microwave meals for dinner, because she was on the computer every second of the day. When she was done with her job, she would go on facebook till one in the @TIME1. Then she would go to bed then set her alarm, so she can go on the computer again at @TIME1. So she barely feeds her kids, wakes up early every @TIME1 just to go on the computer. So once people get adicted with the computer, you can barely do anything about it. We need to enjoy life. Nature, friends, family. All part of life. Enjoy it while we can. About @NUM1 people probably don't go on the computer. Some effects we have on the computer for some people is they can get addicted, the computers there only friend, or even not liking outdoors. But the computer is not your only friend. You can have plenty more friends. If you go on facebook, and you have @NUM2 friends, you have someone to talk to. Don't just sit there in front of the screen and @CAPS3 them or email them. You should have a face to face conversation with that person. Your actually out, instead of in your house all day. It would be nice just to get some fresh air @NUM3 people, out of @NUM4, enjoy going outdoors. For example, my best friend asked me if I can go to the movies and then sleep over her house. But I said no because I was to busy playing on my computer. She was upset. And so was I. I didn't realize what I said to her. But I called her back up and apoligized. No one should be to busy to play the computer, instead of hanging out with friends. We all need to enjoy life, and hang out with friends and family. We allowed to enjoy life while we can.",10
1863,"Imagine you are on the computer at work but then all of the sudden your computer screen goes blank it has crashed, and you've lost all of the information that is vital for your to know and remember. A computer breaking could happen to anyone but the large problem is, most people don't know how to fix it. All of your information is gone and you are stuck without a way access all of the data you need for work, or you can't find important news online. This could happen with your children's computers too and they could loose necessary assignments for school. Computers are needed by everyone, and they have so many positive affects on people we can not afford to loose them. Most of us don't think about it that often but we store so much of our lives on the on a computer, if your computer broke, you would be loosing, more than just the internet, you would be loosing photographs you wanted, important word documents, or you loose information on important events you have learned, you don't wont to forget someone's birthday now you? My sisters computer broke two weeks ago and she lost a she had to turn in for colledge. She had to find the paper she wrote, and she needed to retype the entire paper on some else's computers do you wont all of that added simply because your computer brake? Not everyone lives are and we all need computers, it is much easier looking up the important news on the computer on @CAPS1.com rather than finding the news on @CAPS2. Everyone needs to know the news because it is important to be aware of the world around you. Especially if it's about your and the and the news affects you. Computers help us find the news we need to know quicker and easier. At @PERCENT1 of the people in my family have their own computer. It is necessary for us kids to have them too. These been many times where I've been sick and all I had to do was go on the schools website and find the assignments I missed. So I can be prepared for school the next day. Three out of five of my teachersuse computers in the classroom to teach the students in various ways that are more fun than just reading from a text book. The other teachers that don't have us using computers on a regular basis have used them though and that shows just how uuseful computers can be. Everyone uses computers. Everyone needs computers they are too important to loose and up have come to depend on them for work, awareness of the world around us and school. A life with no computers would be like.",9
1864,"Local Newspaper, @CAPS1. you! The one reading this paper! I think that it's okay that people spend so much time on the computer. I am one those people who spend @NUM1 hours a day on the computer. I have @NUM2 reason for this type of amount. My first reason is communication. My second reason is educational benefits. And my last and third reason is the occupation. I hope you will pay close attention these three reasons. You never know who can change your mind. Like I said before, my first reason for thinking daily computer use is okay is because of the communication. It is stated that @PERCENT1 of chiildren, and/or teenagers, have installed a computer communication system. The very popular sites, are such as, @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1!. MSN, @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. These are the easiest ways of computer communication. My second reason I think using a computer on a daily basis is the learning They make computer games from ages @NUM2-7. These games are @PERCENT2 educational. Game include childrens favorite as @CAPS5 and @CAPS6. These games of ten in subjects of math, science, history, typing games, and sometimes different languages. My third reason for thinking staying on a computer for a daily basis is okay is because of the occupation. Computers keep me occupied all day on video games, music, and videos. It is said that playing computer games keeps your brain well stimulated. Are you still there? Once again my @NUM2 reasons for thinking being on the computer for a daily basis is, the communication secondly, educational privlages. Third reason, the occupatied is a big one. Well, I have to go now, please take these reason under consideration.",8
1865,"Dear @LOCATION2 newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @LOCATION1 and I think computers very much benifet are life and that lots' of positive things can com from them. We can learn and get smarter, we can @CAPS3 act with new people and it is just a really great life still lots of good can come from computers. First, one reason computers can be a healthy thing is we can learn and get smarter from them. One the @CAPS2 there is all different sites that have information for anything that your mind can think of. This could help if you need to research for a project or just want to know a fact. Sure you could say that any one could put anything on the @CAPS2 but what are the chances of all the information and facts to be wrong? I think vary slim. Another way we could learn and get smarter is from all the @CAPS3 active games that many children play. You could play a math game, a reading game any game you want and all of these @MONTH1 make you smarter. I think there are many ways to learn from computers and grow. Second, another way computers can be a life learning thing is you @NUM1 to interact with all different people. You could meet anyone you would like. If you wanted to meet with your friends or family to catch up you could or if you just want to talk you could to you could even see them through the computer. This would reconnect you to old friends or to help up with your family. You could also meet people from other countrys. This would show you how other people live or how or what there culture is like. I think I would be very interesting to see new people and sights. last you could even just find a friend to talk to and you would be a much more stranger person because you have more friends and you would learn more. Last, computers just give everyone more life skills. One you get to learn how to type. Which could improve your hand eye coordination. Also this will help everyone in school type and write papers for a class. Another skill this will give you is you will learn how to research and find information. This will deffenetly be a life still because you always going to need to know how to gather information. Also, if you didnt know how to do this you wouldnt be able to find out where to go for car routes or what restaurants are good or anything. I think mostly computers are a great invention and addition to our life. In conclusion, computers are great. From the rest of our lives technology will keep changing and never stop so sooner or later we will have to learn somethings about computer. Computers are a big help in my life, are they in yours?",9
1866,"Dear Local Newspaper, I disagree and agree in the same time. If you want to know why read on. I disagree because in the winter some people don't like to go any where because of the snow. What are going to do? of course they are going to be in their computer like know and days it snow's and yes some but are going. All so people like talking family because know we have webcams and its fun seeing your face and especially your family for example I talk to my family in webcam because they live @LOCATION1 and I live in @ORGANIZATION1. I know some people would like to see there family. Where other people some time people don't go outside and what are you. You nothing but sitting there. Then I agree. I agree because I know we should go outside and play because it is good for us. Also I think when we are in the computer it gets boring. We should also be with are family then bring in the computer. go out with are family and go places because we are not going to do any thing better than in the computer. Go out and eat with family. Theardly I think if thres people would rather be in the computer than be with there family and going outside its there dision. They will miss out of the fun with every body they love. Thank you for reading what I had to say. I hope you like it. I also hope think you should think about what I wrotes...",8
1867,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 in a few years everyone in the @LOCATION1 is over weight. That would be horrible. All people do now days is stay on there computer. All you do is sit there looking at a screen. To me computers are just a waste of time. It’s not a real thing, it makes you have less exercise, and it boring. So, you decide if you want everyone to over weight, but I will not be because I don’t sit at my computer all day. “@CAPS5 wheres dad?” “@CAPS6’s on the computer” “@CAPS7 computers,” I’ve asked my @CAPS5 this a lot and dads always there. @CAPS6 says to me look what @CAPS8 @CAPS9 just sent me. I don’t use at all. Its not the real thing. Computers to me are just a waste of time. When you talk to your friends on facebook, isn’t the same as reality. It is better to talk face to face with your friends and family, @CAPS10 thing is lets say your talking to your best friend. When your together you can say whatever you want. Like my friend @PERSON1 we tell each other anything. But, facebook or @CAPS11 you cant say some staff. One more reason is your talking to a girl you like, but you can’t say you love her on the computer. that is just. Therefore we shouldn’t use them like this. “@CAPS12” I always here my name for something because my parents sit on the computer a lot for work and they are so lazy they cant walk downstairs for something. No, they ask me. You see computer make people have less exercise. When people email each other I hate it, why can’t you walk outside to your mail box and send a letter. People don’t move, walk, or do anything they have less exercise. Even if they were on the computer for @NUM1 hours a day they would have in activities, and exercise. Finally, my last reason. Computers are boring. It’s not as interactive as going outside playing with your friends and family. Yeah you talk to people, but it’s in little words on computers. Outside in real world people talk and laugh together because there friends are doing funny things. How is that funny reading that off a computer. It’s not/ @CAPS13 with friends and family socializing is better besides all you’re doing is stareing at a screen. I bet you can go blind if all you do is sit there all day stareing at a screen with your eyes popping out. There is nothing you can do except sit there while you friends are outside playing because your to fat to have fun exercise so you stay on your computer. @CAPS4 kids and families are outside socializing having fun no where near a computer. This is awesome. Nothing is as real as this. Computers are not realy makes you have less exercise, and are boring. So, is it better to sit there bored to death or going out side, execising, having fun with you friends? I say having fin with friends.",9
1868,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1 and I was writing to state @CAPS1 opinion about the effects of computers. I think that computers are great and they should only be used when you have to look information upon the internet. Some people are spending to much time on the computer and that is how some people get in trouble, should be doing more things with your family instead of just playing on the computers. I also think that maybe the computers are good for some games but not all of them some are a and some are just plane . One thing you should never do id sing up on things you don't know becuase you can easily get wound in a place that you don't want to be in and that is in some one hime the know and will get you i'll really . I think that more parents should . I have wanted . And I did things . So I only went on the sites that I had to see I would picked up and be able to see big family again . @CAPS1 mom always said to . water, I didn't want that. there was a that had been around some guy on the internet. One day she up missing her parents where she went they had no the girl was she came back her parents didn't think it was her so they abanded her she fallowed them then they finally got convinced it was her now she is happely with her faimly.

1869,"Don't you think that computers help people more than make things ? Computers do help people because they take you to the websites you want to see easily, they make duplicating papers easily, and they make talking much easier. More and more people are starting to use computers the right way by doing their work or research and doing it very quickly. First, computers help you by taking you to all the websites you want to see fast and easily. Whether you want to see how your fantasy baseball team is doing or to your teacher's homework page to see what you have to do that night. When it is in the morning and its cold do you want to go out and get your new paper or would you rather walk from your bedroom to the computer? I'd rather take a couple stops to my computer because they are also very convenient @CAPS1 that @ORGANIZATION1 has come out with the I-phone you basically have a computer in your pocket. The only thing is you can't type a school paper and print it out, which brings me to my second reason. My second reason why I think that having computer is a good thing is because you don't have to write a paper twice or even three times to make copys. Instead make them the easy way by just typing them on your computer. Then just press print and it will have a little box that you how many copys you an you can just put the number of copys whether its two or three, or if you are a teacher and have @NUM1 studens you can print @NUM1. My @NUM3 reason why I think that computers make life easier is because they help you talk to people without having to pick up the phone and having to call them. @CAPS1 there are @CAPS2 messaging which you can have a conversation with someone as if you were face to face talking because it is really fast and they also have e-mail where you can share information about business to other business across town, acrossthe country or even acrossthe world in as fast as a single click of send You can also talk to people on social websites like facebook when you and your friends can be in the same chat group taking back and forth. So why, would you waste your time writing a letter to someone and a week later response or picking up the phone and calling a single person at a time when you can just go on your computer. Are you still wondering whether computer make life easier for people? They do make life easier by showing you what websites you want to see fast and easy, they help making copys of papers faster by selecting the number of copys you want. Instead of rewriting them, and they make chatting with friend faster than writing letters. So the next time you type a paper would you rather be on a typewriter looking through history books or typing on a computer, pulling up information and talking with friend at the same time?",10
1870,"To whom this @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 has been much controversy over the debate of computers and how helpful they truly are to our society. I would like to share my educated opinion on this subject, I believe computers are a great asset to society for several reasons. The first being that it is the most popular way to get your news via the internet. Secondly, they allow for automation of various things such as machinery to allow less people to have to work on site. And finally, they are very powerful education tools when connected to the internet. Computers are incredibly useful on a worldwide level for news. A study done shows that @PERCENT1 of people get their news from the internet. Infact, of these @PERCENT1, @PERCENT2 of them receive the news from social networking sites such as digg, twitter, and facebook, for example, within @NUM1 minutes of it occuring twit-pics were posted on twitter of the devastating 8.@NUM1 magnitude earthquake that occured in chile. Another great asset computers have on our society is the ability of automation, both physically and on computers themselfs. Physical automation of machinery at a factory means their are less people needed to work on the job site, while still being able to produce an amount equal to or more of goods a normal staff would be able to produce. It could mean less liability's due to a lower staff number, and companys would make more money and be able to continue to innovate and improve their products. This then causes competition and will make other companys feel they should do the same. This will make companies keep innovating to beat the others and could help stimulate the economy. Finally, with a simple computer at your home, you can very easily become rich with knowledge, for if you know what your doing and where to look, it is as if you had an endless encyclopedia which which is constantly updated with more information. They are a great asset to schools and to students as if needed you can access nearly all of your textbooks online. In fact deans of colleges can even agree with and back up this statement. So this was my informed statement on how useful computers truly all, with ease of acces to news...",9
1871,"Computers are one of the most used technology today. Computers give us great benefits to our world and society. Computers give us the opportunity to learn new things. Also, they provide us with communciation among friends and family. Futhermore, computer are an exellent way to explore our world. Don't you sometimes wonder what's out there? I know I do. Computers are great for exploring our world that we never knew was there, looking up information, images and or even people. Our world is enormous and not everyone has the opportunity to travel to different countries and places and meet new people so, computers is that one way ticket. Not everyone keeps intouch with family and friends forever. Computers provide communication with loved ones. For example, last @DATE1 my mother on facebook found one of her friends from @LOCATION1. They started to chat and the next thing you know her friend she hasn't seen in @NUM1 years came from @LOCATION2 to vist her. Also, a lot of people move thousands of miles away from their famly. My family and I moved from @LOCATION1 and only sometimes our family comes to visit if they can. We stay in touch with our family through computers. My sister and I go on webcam and talk to our cousin, @CAPS1 all the time. It's really great to have a way to see our family. People all over the world find ways to communicate with each others and a big percentage of those people us computers. Computers are a great way to get up to date with what's going on around us. My mother's boss doesn't have a television so the only way he sees the news is by computer. Others such as I have so many questions about our world or anything at that matter. One of the biggest ways to get my answer is computers. They have the answer to everything. No one knows everything about everything but the computer does! Forty-three out of fifty people say that the easiest and most reliable way to get information or research is the computer. To conclude, many people depend on computers. They have very good benefits to our society today. Such as, providing communication with friends and family. Also, by letting us explore our world in a whole new way and giving us the opportunity to learn new things everyday.",9
1872,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I have an artcle for you! Computers, just about everyone uses them. What most people don’t know is that they are acually helping them. Computers help people in many ways, they help with hand-eye coordination, they help with information, and even social lives. First computers help with hand-eye coordination. The obvious is the mouse, you need to be able to move the mouse where you want inorder to use a computer. I know I like playing games on the computer. In order to play games you need to not only move the mouse but are the boy board while looking at the screen. Next is computers help with information. Whenever you need to final something out you can go on serch engines like @ORGANIZATION1 or @LOCATION1. It links the whole world so someone knows what your searching for. You can see far away places on computers. You can use programs like @ORGANIZATION1 earth and venture all over the world. Lastly computers are good for a social life. I know just about everyone I know uses either my space or @CAPS3. It's easier to alk to and conect with friends and family online. Say you have family in @LOCATION2. To talk to them or see them you would have to drive to @LOCATION2. Now with computers it's just a click away! You can instant @CAPS4 people, and it's just like talking on the phone but a lot asles! Sure some people spend too much time on their computer but it's fine in moderation. Computers are the new way to socialize, get info, and work an skills like hand-eye coordination.",8
1873,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am writting this letter to you to inform you on the importance of computers. Computers help with connecting with friends on websites such as @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. Those two are really popular. These websites helps connect you to your long lost friends. Also computers help with studying @CAPS6 stuff in the world. Also the biggest one is @CAPS7 witch helps you get online text books and strings. These reasonings are vital to people. Todays Technology has adopted since the @NUM1 th century. What a lot of people like me are into these days are social networking sites. @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 are two of the biggest. What a big problem is with them are that they are so addicting to young adults and kids. But in reality @CAPS11 not as bad as people. Think they are. They allow you to connect with Friends and also they can help connect you to long lost Friends.They really are good. Whats truly great about computers is how you can go on a ""virtual vacation"" @CAPS9 you want to find world news, @CAPS10! its right at your finger tips. @CAPS9 you wouldd like to look at indian tribes, @CAPS11 you go, you get @NUM2, @NUM3 links. Working with a computer is one of the greatest inventions ever. A truly good thing about the computer is how it can help you with @CAPS7. For our science class we have to use online text books. With that being said we have to log on to @CAPS12.hrw.com. Microsoft has really come up with some real good ideas such as word or outlook. All of them help achieve one thing @CAPS7. They are truly one of the best things computers have. These reason should open your eyes to how important a computer is to an average kid. These three reasons are just a few of the millions of reasons on how important a computer is. So please, read this over care fully and take this in to consideration. Thank you!",8
1874,"Dear, editor of local newspaper, I think that computers are a good thing for our society. They can allow you to talk online to diffent people. The computer also increases your hand eye cooridination. Also the computer lets you meet faraway people and learn about faraway places. I think that talking online makes the computer a benefit to our society because we could get help for homework or if not if there was any. You could also talk to your friend if the go to a different school or. Another reason why computers are good because you can talk to a relative that you havent seen in while. If you do not have reletives like you could talk to your brother, sister, mom, or dad. Also the internet is a great way to meet new people or learn more about the people you already know. You can meet new people like people your friends know or your friends cousins as friends but its an up to who you want to talk to online. Computers are good for improving hand eye coordination. That can make yo type faster to finish home work or a project. Also the better your hand eye coordination the better you can be in some sports. So people type for fun but what they dont know is their actually improving their hand eye coordination. Some job employers require that you only type never hand write things so if you have good hand eye coordination you could type neatly fast. Therefore the computer improves your hand eye coordination depending on how much you type. The computer can also teach about far away places and by talking to the people that live in their places can you information on their places. You could learn things like why the i usually like or if it has any nice scenery in that country/place.",8
1875,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people at some point of their life has used a computer, @CAPS3 it was to find specific information or talk to a friend. In @CAPS2 ways, computers benefit so much in our lifes, from giving us news from around the @CAPS7 to watching videos for entertainment. But some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I disagree with the experts because I believe that computers unite the @CAPS7, provides unlimited amounts of information, and can help start a person's carrer. One reason I think computers are beneficial to society is because they can unite the @CAPS7. Ever since the computer was made they have been making new ways to interact with other people, no matter how far away they are. Social websites like @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 allows people to talk with all sorts of people. For instance, if you have a family member living in @LOCATION1, if your family member and you have @CAPS4 accounts you could friend request her and be able to talk whenever you want. Wouldn't you love to be able to talk with far away relatives? I know I would! Another reason why I think computers are beneficial to society is the unlimited amount of information computers have with computers, you can know just about anything you desire. You can find a recipe for chocolate cake, you can find the total amount of men who served in @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10, seeing nature in person is better than looking it up on your computer, but what you find on the computer not only improves your knowledge on nature, but also can increase your love for it! Finally, I think that computers are beneficial to society because it can launch a person's carrer. For example, my favorite band @CAPS11 @CAPS12 started their carrer on @CAPS5. After word spread about their music labels were drying to sign them. So just by using a computer to post their music on the internet they've become incredibly famous. It's now or never, you can either benefit from what computers can provide you or just always be a step behind. Most importantly, with all the knowledge you have gained from computers you can go on to be a very successful buisnessman or musician. Smart, determined people would take advantage of what computers have to offer. So, if you are smart and determined continue to use your computers and have a great life!",10
1876,"Dear local news paper, I am writing about your question about the affects of computers. I think that it does benefit society because you can learn about cultures, you can see all the places in the world, you can interact with your family and friends, and lastly it helps you with hand eye coordination. On computers you can learn about all the cultures of the world, right at your fingertips. Also if you want to know what they do or eat or do for fun you can look that up with a click of a mouse. No more going to the library and spending hours looking up different places in the enciclopedia, and not finding much. Go on the internet, look it up you are bard to find some culture, or mabe even find out about your culture. There is countless cultures to see, find a computer, and look something up! Your bound to learn something knew and exciting. With a computer you can go around the world. By on click of the mouse you can go to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION5, @LOCATION3, ect. With the internet you can travel around the world to see how differrent it is, or how much worse it is than your home country. Seeing the world will open up your mind, it will mkae you appreciate the world for what it is. Also appreciate what you have; to be thankful for your family and friends. The best part is, is that you can explore any place you want, go to australia and see the outback, go to south america and see the @LOCATION4. No danger, just the wild wilderness of the real world. No more boring pictures, go onto google earth and explore the earth, let your mind run free, no more un moving pictures, the real deal. Also watching free online vidios about nature will be even easier, but less interactive. With computers you can interact with other people online, on or in a chat room. If you or your friend moved away, you can talk with a web-cam and see each other instead of writing letters, @CAPS1, or emailing. It is like he/she is right there next to you. The stone age is over, there's technology, use it interact with old buddies, talk with them almost face-to-face. Computer chats are the way to go! While using a computer is good, using to much is bad. Kids these days should spend more time outside, away from technology. They should explore the real nature, not to nature. But that doesnt mean you shouldn't use the computer it just means don't over use it. We still need to interact with the real world. Use it but but don't abuse it! Lastly computers help with hand-eye coordination. Witch is good for all most every most every known to man. Using computers increases your hand-eye coordination. So once in a while play a computer game, just improve it so you can use it in sports. In conclusion, I think computers benefit society in a positive way. I think that evry one, one in a wile should go on a computers and explore it. Computers help you with learning about different cultures, seeing around the world and its nature, interactin with people online. But don't over use it. Computers are absolutly wonderful but nothing compare to the real world. Like famous computer inventor @PERSON1 said, ""Computers can help us in every day life, but nothing can compare with what is realy out there!""",9
1877,"Dear Local Newspaper: I have recently read that computers of becoming very will now and used for many things. The survey in your article said that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 - children use the computer a day. In my opinion we should have the computer. Firstly, Computers help you with school. The way computers help in in school is they also you to look up many important things you @MONTH1 need for a project or homework. @PERSON1 a teacher at the middle school in @LOCATION1 said that @PERCENT2 of the teachers use the computer for class to give students vissuals on what they are learning. These days the computer is used more and more for schooling and such, people have online colledge corces if they can now go to school. Profsaer @PERSON2 said that @PERCENT3 of his students use the computer for school for class assignments such as textbooks that are online. That is why computers are important for school. Secondly, you can talk to people I socialize with friends. Which is good because you need to talk to family & friends that away or live in a different such day is. @PERSON2 says""@CAPS1 & teens are socializing though computer this way thatn and."" The computer protecs people from harm. How? you are probably saying well if people hear your through the phone then they you and could That is why talking through computer is not a idea at all. Thirdly, you can use the computer to learn about faraway places people. While you are on the computer you don't just play games or chat you use it for about people that are famous and very well know. I remember when I was in history in @NUM1 grade I had to write about a musition and I did and I found realy good info about @CAPS2 and him, so computers are a big part of learning & projects acts.. As you can see computer are good for learning about faraway places & people. In conclusion, computers have a very big effect on people. My reasons are schooling, socializing, and lastly learning about faraway places and people. I urge you to keep computers. I know hand this important desition to you, pleas make the right one.",8
1878,"As computers and the internet become so populer, more people start to say that they are having a negative affect so society. They say that people spend more time on their computers and less time getting outside and being healthy. I strongly disagree with this. Computers help in many way. They help the environment and are a better news service. There even more ways that they can help. Computers can store a lot of information. They save this information of having to keep it on paper. With all the info it stores, there's a lot of paper you wouldn't need to use. This is why computers are for the environment. People have to cut down trees to get paper. If paper is used less, then would be cut down less. When your getting news off the computer, you're saving trees too. You're getting news off of the computer instead of the neewspaper. Newspapers are made of paper. It's in their name. Using the computer is less paper being used and that save trees. Newspapers get their information, they they have to put in a newspaper and it the next day. It's day old news. On the computer news can be set as fast as minutes it happens. News in much faster and reliable on a computer. You also don't have to wait until the newspaper comes to your to get the news. Some newspaper companies don't deliver the paper until @NUM1 at @NUM2 o'clock in the @TIME1. On the computer you can just go on the internet and click on the news. Which would only take about @NUM3 seconds. News on the computer is much @CAPS1 of the more recent luxuries of the computer is socializing. There are many ways you can talk with your friends on the internet. You can talk with your friends on @CAPS2. You could also dont on @CAPS3. The best part of it is that it's all completely @CAPS4. If use your phone, you have to pay for the minutes. Not on the computer. I hope you can see how the computer makes so many tasks easier and fast. Or how the computer is very helpful for the environment. You can socialize on it and you can find news on it. It's just the better choices.",8
1879,"Dear @CAPS1 of the Local Newspaper: @CAPS2 editors you decide what stories get to be put in our newspaper. I would like you to include my article on computers. I beleive computers have good and bad affects on people. Computers are dangerous, and not very healthy. However, they are a great tool for learning. On the other hand, computers are very addicting and can take control of your life. First of all, computers can be very dangerous. Especially when it involves the internet. There are many website such @CAPS2 facebook, twitter, and myspace where you can have your own profile that strangers @MONTH1 view. Nothing on the internet is private, therefore when naughty pictures are released, you can get in big trouble. My neighbor, went to a party where there was alcohol and a lot of bad people. She had fun, but her friends took pictures and put them on facebook. She is very smart and applied for @ORGANIZATION2, a college in @LOCATION1. Unfortunatley, she did not know the board of @ORGANIZATION2 and all other colleges, check facebook for innappropriate pictures. Therefore, she was not accepted into @ORGANIZATION2, not because she wasn't smart, but because of the innappropriate drinking pictures that went on facebook. Secondly, computers are very unhealthy, because of several reasons. One reason is because they are so addicting and time flies when you are on them. @NUM1 out @NUM2 teenagers do nothing but computer/internet when they get home. Their bodies need exercise! ""@CAPS3-a-days, technology is getting more and more advanced, and all people aren't exercising enough. We are all refreshing our internet explorer page for the lastest update!"" says @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1. Some parents @MONTH1 think their kids being on the computer @NUM3 is good practice for being the next ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5,"" but it's just a waste of time and unhealthy. However, even though computers @MONTH1 be unhealthy and dangerous, they are great for school work and learning. When the internet is not being used for chatting and profile-ing, it is a great way to be taught more and exciting things. ""@CAPS6"" is a great website to search the web and to use for finding biographies and research landmarks or historical moments or figures. Other websites such @CAPS2, ""ask.com"" and ""wikipedia.com"" are excellent for looking for pictures of places for a power point presentation. Not everyone has the money to travel, so why not look on the internet for a beautiful island, close your eyes, and pretend you're there?! In conclusion, computers are horrible for our bodies, dangerous for our safety, yet wonderful for school use. Please put this article in our local newspaper. That way maybe people will change their way of living, and not live like the slabs I see all of us becoming. Thank you for your time.",10
1880,"Dear Newspaper editor, I have been notified about the recent argument concerning wether or not computers give ""positive"" or ""negative"" affects on people. In personally believe they give off a positive affects. My reason for believing that is based on my own life expireance and on what I have seen. I have no siblings, so I'm always alone. I get depressed from that fact, but the internet provided me with people to talk to. I can also study for the many harsh things that can come up in school. Last my father is in @LOCATION1, so that means hes not here to show me love, but with the internet I can @CAPS1 cam with him, which will make me not worry alot. All my life I have been alone, I have no siblings to keep me company. Although I have friends that are like brothers to me, that still isn't enough to fill my loneliness wen I feel lonely, I turn to the internet. It allows me to chat with people from all places. Wen im talking I feel happy and not lonely. School can be rough; the home work, test, reports. Without internet, you probably would not finish half the stuff you are suppose to finish in that ammount of time. With internet, I can study for those important test's, and finish those important assingnments. My father is in the @ORGANIZATION1 wich means hes always being deployed for an extended period of time. Wen that happens, our communication is limited. We found a solution to this and its called ""@CAPS1 caming"", thanks to the interest I can check up on my father and make sure hes ok. Also my father can do the same with me. I can see his face and let my worries leave my mind, so that I can focus on school and other equally important things. Well that is my opinion on the computer argument. It not only helps me with lonelyness, school, and communication, but much more than that. It also helps millions and millions of other people.",9
1881,"It's better for people to spend more time on computers because with out them we can not make now enventions. Students also can not check there school work @CAPS1 they missed any friends also can not communicate with each other @CAPS1 they're far away. with out people spending on computers life will be harder for every one. @CAPS1 people don't spend time on computers, it will be harder to com up with new enventions. maybe car components will will come less and less advancer and withut computers cars can not run. The reason why is because a computere in a car is how you steer, or accelerate, even put the heater or A.C. on. The car wouldn't know what to do. a major reason why we need computers is the military. @CAPS1 we didn't have then in the military we wouldn't knoe ehat or how to get into a biulding. We also wouldn't know were people are because we wouldn't have access to satelite. Another reason why we need computers is to make more efficient ways to make the earth healthier so we don't polute the air with power plants. with out computers kids can not larn the right way. It would be hard for kids to amazin what the teacher is trying to say. @CAPS1 we didn't have mime boards we can't have an interactive way and fun way to learn, @CAPS1 we keep enventing new technology for school students will be able to visualize history better. Also @CAPS1 a student was abscent he couldn't go online to check or checking his website. @CAPS1 You have friends that either live in a different state you wouldn't be able to communicate with him. People coudn't talk to each other online or type to each other. @CAPS1 you have a relitive or someone closely related in college you couldn't talk to him unless you send letters, letter are usaully reall slow to get to each other, but by computers you can see each other instatly without computers the world can not function. @CAPS1 people didn't use computers the world would not turn. People can not communicate the way they want to. People can not event things, military would be falling apart. This is my opinion why poeple need to use computers.",8
1882,"Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter to you because computers are effecting people these days. Starting with myspace it's causing people to not interact with family members. Theres a lot of websites out there many of them are causing problems like I don't know alot too many. Then theres games people spend more time doing that than going to work, going to school and doing things there supposed to do. There not doing any of this because there on computers all day. I think if there wasn't access to all of this there would be more people doing what they got to do. I believe there should be less websites so peole come able to go to school and work instead of being unhealthy.",5
1883,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you agree that all people spend time on the computer but only what they can handle. My reason of sayin this is because firstly learning, c ommuncate with people, projects. Firstly, On the computer you can learn alot of things that your probaly really interested in. Like say your interested in being a lawyer or say maybe getting in to real state. They really @CAPS1 teach things like that in school. Wouldn't you agree? An maybe even your family is going on a vaction and you wanna learn about the place. An diffent fun places you can go. Second, I cant see my freinds everyday or call the either. So the best simplist way is to talk to them on the computer. And if one of my family member or even freinds live really far an your unable to call. I can go on the computer an talk. Wouldn't you agree. An in my experinents I havent talk to my best freind from third grade till she moved. and I found her page on the computer and started talking again it was amazing I could I was taking her years inst amazing? Isn't it amazing how you can learn about basicaly amost anything. So if doing a project all I have to do is go on the computer looking in encyclopedia instead all i have to type in the subject/topic and all my info is right infront of me. An it can also teach me now to speak other lanuges. Som people even take college over a computer. And I can't go without comptures never did since @CAPS2 born. Learning communacition. are the reason people are on the computer so much. I hastley, think people are not spending too much time if thats why they so be it.",8
1884,"One does not believe in the wonder of computers because they don't benefit society at all. Statistics have shown that @PERCENT1 of kids who go on the computer research bad sites and see thinks that kids their age should not see. It is not good for children's health to always be on the computer as soon as they got home from school. If we banish computer or at least brought the use down to a minimum we would still be able to do the same exact things without computers. One does not believe in the use of computers. Computers do not benefit society at all. When kids got on the computer they almost always research bad things their parents wouldnt want them to see. Kids go onto bad sites when they @PERCENT2 of the kids have been bullied at least twice on the internet. When you are on those ""chat rooms"" not only can you be bullied but you @MONTH1 be talking to a creeper when you really, this is exspecially dangerous girls and @PERCENT3 of girls chat and only @PERCENT4 of guys chat so it is more likely for girls to be talking to bad guys. This is why one thinks computers are bad for our society. When you are always can you are out as you do not get outside as much so your system is not as built up. You also could get germs off of the key board. %@PERCENT6 of the people who come down with swine flu got it off of a computer. Computer hurt our society and are not good for them. When you have a computer you think you can not live with out it, but you can. You could get your info from an encyclopedia. Your grandparents could help you a lot with history. You could even talk to your friends on to phone, what a concept. You can get @PERCENT5 of you info not on the computer, our society does not need computers. One does not believe in computers. You go on bad sites when you are on the computer. Kids are not as healthy when they go on the computer. You are able to do everything without computers says @CAPS1 computers. Society does not need this extra thing hurting them because they don't benefit our society. I do not support computer.",8
1885,"It has come to my attention people are beginning to controverse on what effect computer have on people. In my opiinon I believe computers have a had effect on people.First, many people are becoming obeast because they spend to much time on the computer instead of exercising. Next kids are starting to fail and not focus on their homework cause they waste so much time on the computer, @CAPS1 computers can cause arguments between families fighting over who goes on it when. i believe computers have a bad affect on people cause they take up the time kids could be exercising kids need to be active and get a certain amount of exrcise a day in oredr to stay healhty. Every ones so wrapped up in computers these days that they don't think to go outside. This is the cause why kids are coming and not staying in shape. Everyones so anxious to go home and get on their computer they don't even think about sports and outdoor activities anymore. Its time a stand and get people back in by limiting computer time. Computer people because kids are spending so much time on computers they don't do their homework anymore or focus on studying for /test. I believe this is the reason grades are getting so poor. Everyone's so wnated about going home on facebook talking to ther friends on aim and computer games. They don't even about their should work and the of it. I can net you if computers were taken away for a week kids start doing their school work again because they would have nothing better to do. Let's begin to getting grades back up to atleast average. Finally, computers can cause arguments between families fighting over who goes on it first, when kids get home from school theres no doubt theyw ant to go on right away. This will cause siblings to argue and parents to become stressed. Parents are stressed enough already when they come home from work they don't want un needed tension when they go home too. No computers will help releave stress off parents! After reading this I hope you come to an arguments with me. Computers are the reason kids are becoming abeast and not exercising. Second, computer cause kids to fail and not focus on their school work. LAst but not least computers can cause un wanted argument between families. Let's stop all this by getting everyone to see computers have a bad affect on people!",10
1886,"Dear editor, @CAPS1 are many amazing pieces of advanced technology. A computer is one of them. Computers can be good for all sorts of things, but if you look the advantages @CAPS1 are a few disadvantages about the uses of them. Computers have become more popular over the years, more people are buying them and using them. The many if them are putting drawbacks on our lives. Based on the amount of time people spend on the computer, they are not doing or exercise, not enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. Not doing much exercising can lead to an unhealthy life. In order to stay healthy, besides eating healthful foods, a big contributor is the amount of exercise. Sitting at the computer all day involves no physical movement. It is like your body is a sleep all day. Doing nothing during the day can lead to problems with your health. People will begin to notice to maintain a healthy to balance the calories you take in with. You will burn no calories sitting at a computer. Not balancing these will lead to gain obessity. To live a longer life you to be strong. In order for your in get strong have to by doing something active. A good way is get active be going enjoying nature. The world of beautiful and. When we pay attention to the computer the beauty of nature. Sometimes spending time with nature can be really relaxing. Listening in the birds cheerping or watching can be a stress releiver. Every once in a while it is good to get in your body. Inside @CAPS1 is no. Outside, @CAPS1 is plenty. If you don't want to go outside alone, go with a family member or a friend. Family and friends help us determin who we are. In our family we special bonds with each other that in our life time. The computer takes this away. Connecting to each other will give us something to talk about. When we all get along we support each other through everything. When we spend time on the computer it doesnt allow us to connect, bond, or gather support. Even though @CAPS1 are many advantages to the computer, @CAPS1 are disadvantages that effect us more. The computer lead to less exercise, not enjoying, nature, and less interaction with family and friends. Computers are something that need to use up less time in our lives.",9
1887,"Dear local newspaper editor, I heard you were finding out who supports and doesnt support computer usage. Well I support the usage because I think you can learn more with it. Also it gives you good hand-eye cordination and you can talk to the people all around the country. Here is some more ideas why I support it. Lets say you are doing your homework and theres this one math problem that you dont get. You can just go on your computer and find out steps of how to get through it. Plus you can learn about other countries or specific places or even some famous person. So lets say you want to learn about @PERSON1, you can just go on your computer, type his name in and boom, everything you want to know about him. That was a reason why I support the asage. Another reason is that if you play online games, it could be your hand-eye cordination. Also just for not games that so really you good problem. The final reason is that you can talk to people through the internet. They could be your friends, family or in another country. The people who are not supporting it said that computer time takes away time from friends and family. Well I disagree with that. Online you can chat with friends and family either through a chat room or video chat. Plus lets say you have a family member in @LOCATION1 and you want to talk to him, you can do that on the computer. That was another reason why I support it. So these were the reasons why I support the usage of the computer. It helps you learn new things, helps your hand eye cordination and you can talk to friends and family.",8
1888,"I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers and technology have over all benifited our society. They help widen everyone's communication, provide new educational opertunities, and help advance businesses. Communication is a huge part of our daily lives , but sometimes it's not always easy to reach, contact with people. Computers help us stay close with family and friends because let's face it with crazy air fair prices today not everyone can afford to visit their families. With computers talking to your loved ones is just a couple of clicks away. Web cams allow you to talk and see the person you're communicating with, so it's like they're right there in the room with you. Not to mention think of all the friendships computers have saved. It's always sad when a dear friend moves but with e-mail, chat rooms, and web cams it's like your best curious towards different places, cultures and people which is why computers are so important. If you want to know about a different place all you have to do is go to @LOCATION1 and look it up, plus you canhave friends all over the world something we couldn't do with out computers. Computers have provided so many new educational opertunities for people. Think about how school use yo be the teacher would teach, stbudents would right out papers by hand, and they would have to carry around those back breaking books. Now kids can type out almost anything, have fun video projects, and head online bmooks so no one has to deal with a heavy back pack. It's also easier for teachers think of that of how hard it must have been to keep track of grades, homework, and who showed up for class that's a lot of stress on one person now everything is in an organized system. Plus kids don't have to go through hours of book research when thay can look up almost anything online. Computers also play a huge role in the business world. Large and small compinies depend on computers to keep everything organized. Yes includes pay checks, files, and customer information could you imagine what would happen if we wake up one morning and there were no computers? All the businesses would be so un origanized and unadvanced. Because of computers people stay closer, businesses can thrive, and new educational opertunities are created every day.",10
1889,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 teens are online @NUM1 chatting with friends and surfing the web. I personally think we should get off the computer. If you want to talk to someone, just call them! With a computer, it can start a lot of drama too! And lastly, we should enjoy nature! So obviouly computers have a larg effect on people! Keep reading to hear my reasoning. The first reason why I think computers effect us is because we get attached to talking to people from a computer! We are use to going on facebook and @CAPS5 everyone. If you really want to talk to them, just call them. Also we need to spend time with our family. If you get off the computer, then you can see them more. So computers have a large effect on us! Keep reading to hear more. Another reason why i think teens need to get off the computer is because it can start drama. I think everyone has heard of the @ORGANIZATION1, now his son killed himself, and it had something to do with the computer. Also, a lot of people learn that saying something mean to someone through a screen is a lot easier than to there face. This all starts a lot of drama, and can really hurt someone. My last reason of why being on the computer effects people is because kids to to enjoy nature. Take a walk, go for a bike ride, do anything! You get, and dont want to do anything after sitting on the computer! You could even gain weight from just sitting looking at a screen all day. You need to get energy, go play with friends! Just get off the computer!!! So I hope I made my point clear. I would be better if you get off the computer. Just call someone is you want to talk to them. And being on the computer can start drama. Lastly, you should enjoy nature and go out side. I really hope you agree with me that we need to get off the computer.",8
1890,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 computers are often useful, there are various reasons why they do not benefit the society. Computers read to inactive and overwieght people. In addition, time on the computer takes away time that should be spent with family and frineds. Lastly, computers can be extremely dangerous. Children can easily access unsafe website. this comes to show that computers are hurting our society every single day. When teens come home from school, one of the first things they do is turn on their laptop or computer. People sit down infront of the screen for hours and hours instead of being outside & working their body. As you know, obesity is certainly a problem in @LOCATION1, and computers clearly are not helping this issue. Computer addicts are too busy searching the web or playing games to get some exercise and fresh air. Instead of palying, of teens the computer. This proves that using computer too much is defenitely for. Time spent on a computer is also time spent away from family and friends. People choose to be alone on the computer over interacting with other people. This strongly interfere with social skills. Studies show that it is very important to be around your family as often as possible. However, computers make it difficult for people to be around friends and family. FInally, computers cause harm to teens everyday. Children who have free acsess to internet are often going in dangerous websites. For example, in the last week, the ""chat"" has been allows anyone to video chat with any complete stranger various websites around the world involve talking to complete strangers in amy ways this can be very harmful. Therefore, people using computers are always at risk. In conclusion, computers aren't as important as many people think. In fact. they just cause problems. Computers & laptops lead to people not exercising and becoming unhealthy. Next, computers interfer with people interacting with family and friends which can cause social problems. Lastly, computers are dangerous for everyone in various ways. Therefore, computers have a very bad effect on people all over the world. ",9
1891,"How often do you use a computer a day? I barely go on, but some of are are in all the time. This doesn't benefit society. Yes, if you go on for a couple minutes a day to do research or homework it benefits you, but most of the time it makes you lazy, you don't do anything obesity is a problem and how are our future generations goint to know how to use a library. My sister is a good example. Using compters don't always us. She is on the computer from when get home from school at three till when we have to go to bed. I always wonder what she does that makes her stay on that long but all it is a computer game. How is a video game beneficial? It makes her not do anything. I always end up her chores and talking the out. This generation (@NUM1) is different then the previous ones. Childhood obesity is huge @NUM2 kids are obese from the ages of two up. This isn't only because of the food we eat but also because of the technology we have. Kids today sit around all day on the computer and using cell phones to talk to friends when you could be outside riding bikes and playing basketball. How does kids being overweight contribute to this socity? What kind of message are we sending to people if we only use the computer ot do things such as research and talking to friends, when you can walk to a library or friends house? If we always do research on the computer than are kids going to know use a library or dictionary? These would no use of the encyclepedias and alases if all you have to do is type in a word and everything you need to is right there. Some of the information might not even be acurate. How would you feel if you wrote an encyclopedia nad it's not used for anything? It wouldn't be a good feeling I know that much. Not all kids feel thesame way but what they don't know that what that day isn't getting and you supposed to get at least thiety minutes of exercise a day when some people's only source or activity is gym class. Almost all kids are probably lazier than you were as a kid, they might not have and instead be on the computer you dinner. On chat systems you might think you are talking to your friend? You won't know because you can't see who your talking to.",9
1892,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people our community use computers was an essenciail port of day-to-day. However, little do they known, the interaction between computers and humans can be negative. First of all, when going online, you discuss your thoughts with virtualpeople, rather than reel friends. Also, you do not recieve the required exercise and sunlight your body needs to provide to stay healthy. Finally, computers are a large distractron in the eyes of teenagers and students. Computers not only are negative, but decrease the ability of soeralizing in schools and other places in our community. Throught online chat rooms, facebook, and other anteractions between a group of people, can not only be harmful, but dangerous. For instance, @PERCENT1 of middle school students decide to become friends with or talk to people they never even heard of as seen before. As a result, you are trusting a figure you have never physically seen before, who might as well be sharing your personal information. Another reason that virtual negative, is because of the of socializing. Through recent studies, @NUM1 people only talk on facebook, without greeting one another in public. This can not only decrease your ability of speaking in public or in front of a group, but the idea of interacting with other people your age. Finally, virtual people on different networks can be figures that are harmful or not feel you who they. For instance, one girl from @LOCATION1 didn't know her ""bestfriend"" on facebook was a @NUM2-year-old man seeking information from her. However, the idea of no exercise appears to as important. Without exercise and the ability to get from sunlight, your body won't function properly. For instance, the required amount of hours to receive exercise is one hour per day. With on message of the goal won't be reached. reason exercise could be a top priority, because of the avaiable sunlight scientists have recently discovered that teenagers stay up late because of lock of sunlight while on the computer. As a result teen not receiving the proper sunlight but sleep grades. Finally, one last reason, is how children end even adults over the years have became choose, and overweight. The main factor is the race of sitting in front of your computer for more than @NUM3 hours a day. Exercise and socializing not only effect humans, but serve as a as well. Through online gaming and other programs on computers, these factors can serve as a huge distractions. For instance in @DATE1, @NUM4 out of every @NUM5 students didn't or forgot to do each task or assignment from school, due to computers. This both decreases and the to focus as well. Another aspect, its how teenagers are denying and disobeying chores given to them by parents. For instance, I remember being @NUM6, and telling my mother I would set the table, but was @NUM7 minutes late because of of a program. I was playing. This resulted in both a consequence and disadvantages lack responsibility one last reason, you @MONTH1 be an important stuation, but then decide to take a break. Without a time unit humans go on the internet not knowing how much time they have actually sent of it. All hree of these aspects to why computers are negative. Ever since the manufacturing of computers began all ages have been interested in the technology. However, computers are unsafe, due to virtual friends, hours of exercise have gone down, and people have continued to be distracted. Even though the world needs technology computers have their flaws.",11
1893,"Do you know that the average mailing letter takes more than @NUM1 days to get to the designated area? Obviously, that is a long time for something to get to somewhere else! Computers help you get the message to the person you want to read it faster. They are great for free time and research too! @CAPS9 are a definate improvement in society! In the world of communication, @PERCENT1 of students in my school prefer the use of @CAPS1-mail and @CAPS2. I mean come on, who wouldn't like it better? I is about @NUM2 faster than old fashioned snail-mail. It is also more accurate. Letter sent through the mail have to go through different post offices and then a mailman has to deliver through all of that the letter @MONTH1 get damaged, it could be loss, or it could to the wrong house! Machines are a lot more accurat in getting to the absolute destination. I have to admit, I do spend alot of time online. But most of it is not bad for me. In my I go on website, I of the stories people write about ! It's a great me. In addition kids get together and play outside, if theyre always calling, the phone will be tied up. What's the solution to this? Mentioned before were @CAPS1-mail and @CAPS2. kids can interact the phonebill. Computers are also great for sharing digital pictures. You can send those is an @CAPS1-mail too!. Imagine this, your teacher give you a research paper that is due in @NUM1 days. You run to the library but all of the subject have been checked out! What do you do? Of course, you to use the @CAPS9 for gathering information. There are some really cool websites for that. They have experts behind them that get kids information and online for everone to know! When kids don't have the neatest handwrinting, the paper @MONTH1 look sloppy even though they worked hard on it. With typing and printing, the papers automaticly look better than if they used it. Fare it, Computers are just better for. Say ""@CAPS6 More"" to snail mail, and ""@CAPS7"" to @CAPS1-mail. Dont be scared when the library has @CAPS6 books on what your looking to research. Not @CAPS10 on the @CAPS9 bad. I know you agree with me, @CAPS9 are a great improvement to @CAPS10!",9
1894,"Computers help people learn about other places. They help meet people online even, but computers shouldnt be used every second of the day. Instead of watching a screen for most of the day people should go exercise, see nature, and enjoy the company of family and friends. Using a computer all day can make people fat because of the lack of exircise. So the computer can help you with research, or information on current events, but can it make thin just by stairing at a screen? Dr. @DR1 stated"" @CAPS1 is growing to be very common in the average home, and part of the reason is people are using there computers way to much."" People should be out running or looking plants. Looking at nature is beautiful and it keeps many off the computer. Some prefer watching insects roam more then a computer game. Nature is intresting to watch and it will keep you active. Computers can ruin your eyes and a plant or an insect or a tree cant do that. If your on a computer for to long you could have a seizure while you are on it. Nature cant to that while your outside. People should see and enjoy there family and friends as often as possible. If you stay on a computer for hours you seem like an old hermet not seeing anyone. Family and friends are very important. Seeing them will make both you and them happy. A computer is no friend it can be addictive. Even if a computer seems like the only thing to do, go out with some friends. Computers can be fun, and help get your walk done, but they can be bad too. If you feel the use to go on the computer right it and go exirsice, or explore nature, or even go with some friends, just dont go on the computer.",8
1895,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4't you like to have a lower electric bill each month? What about saving the planet? Imagine trying to have a conversation with your child and they don't respond because their glued to the computer screen. The issue to grapple with is, would you like to have a face to face conversation with someone than them being glued to the computer. I strongly suggest that we all do the green thing and shut are computers off and enjoy the beauty of nature. Without a doubt computers are grate but the take away from family time. Second, not enough kids are exercizing because of them. Lastly, people arn't gitting enough fresh air, from the outdoors. People and families all around the world don't talk with their families enough any more. I know when I am talking to a family member or friend I would rather do it face to face than me looking at them and their looks at the computer screen. I could remember a time when a friend of mine was mindlesley watching the computer screen and something just killed her computer and thats when she realized that your family matters more than looking up pointless stuff on the internet. I know states all over the country are complaining about child obeseaty and people not getting enough exercise. If some states provide schools with computes than why cant the provide them with healthy food as well. Don't you like the satisfaction of a good run or lifting a few wates? Why would you then go sit in front of the lousy computer. Imagine being over weight in highschool and a computer geak. So go out today and lose @NUM1 pounds for your next highschool reunion. Shouldn't we all do the green thing and just shut off our computer and enjoy the beautiful nature raight out side. @PERCENT1 of the reason that scientest predict our beautiful eart @MONTH1 die in @DATE1 is because of to many non degradable electronic devices such as computers. ""I sure would like to finish the eighth grade"" says young @NUM2 grade student @PERSON1. I say we let him. Without a doubt computers are an excelent helpful tool but they are destroying our @NUM3 of a kind earth. Imagine what the sports teams would look like if all the kids layed of the computer and goined a sports team. I strong ly advise that more and more people should shut their computer off and walk away. More kids need to exercise and socelize with their family. Lastly they should enjoy nature before its all gone. Now is the time to do the green thing before its to late. The issue to graple with is to you believe that computers have a negative affect on society or not. So go out today and shut your computer off!",10
1896,"Dear local Newspaper, I think computers have great effects on people. People could learn a lot from computer. Some say that computers make people more lazy but I think that is only for a person the already is lazy Not everyone. Computers help people learn about things more effectfully unlike textbooks. When learning on a computer you learn about things in a fun way by playing games or watching movies, you could learn about faraway people and places a lot easier. Computers help people talk to their family and friends easy even if you are in @LOCATION1 and your friend moved away to texas you could video chat or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 fast and fun. It could help with hand-eye coordination when playing games because you move the mouse fast and you press @CAPS3 fast and could help you with hand-eye coordination. Some people say that computers make people lazy on computers you can play an exercise video and work out while you are on the computers. Computers have made many people happy you can and print then and then a lot then typing them. Computers help @CAPS4 find cures and medical advances to cure sick people. Many Computers help people work from home so they could take care children. Computers help manage their money, without computers a lot of things have ever came about.

1897,"Dear local newspaper, I am writing to you today about how i feel about ocmputer. I think computers are very dangerous. You need to be caustious about what you post on websites, you should only talk to your friends and family (never anyone you don't know), and if other people are harassing you over the internet you must @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Talking in open chat rooms can be very dangerous. People in those chat rooms could to you about your age, trick you so you @CAPS2 them everything about you, and then are day finally meet them in person. Now a day, people are getting killed, raped and who knows what else because parents don't relize their child is talking to strangers in chat rooms. Things like open chat rooms can be and are extreamly dangerous. You need to be more cautious about these chatrooms. Identity theft is happening alot more these days. E-mails that track you saying their you credit card company or even pop-ups that say you wan stuff. Some people, don't relize that the're fake! Once you enter all you information in such as, @CAPS1, address, phone number, social security, or credit card number, you will never be able to get that information back. This is how most peoples identity gets stolen. So, don't let those e-mails, and pop-ups trick you. The internet is most popular for cyber bulling. Cyber bulling is when you are , or harassing @CAPS3 or even a group of people. Myspace, facebook and e-mailing is how most cyber bulling is done. The person who is bulling people normally hides their identity so you wont find out who it is. This is a major problem. When you recieve things that you think is like bullying, threaining or @CAPS3 haunting you @CAPS2 @CAPS3!! Don't wait until the problem get worse, you must @CAPS2 @CAPS3 right away. This way if you @CAPS2 @CAPS3, they could stop it imeditaly. In conclusion, I think the computer is unsafe. The computer can be very dangerous and if you don't watch you children while they are on the computer, they could be in danger. They @MONTH1 even be getting cyber buillied, or even entering information on websites that they shouldn't. I hope that my opinions about computers persuaded you to agree with me.",8
1898,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1! @CAPS1! @CAPS1! Do you hear that, thats the sound of a computer. I am trying to say people are always on there computer. I believe people should spend less time on the computer. Here are my reason why, it could damage your brain. You would be less focus in school. Lastly you will forget things. Have your head started to hurt? Well I know what is one problem and it is computers. If you stoped on a computer for @NUM1 hours straight then your eyes would start to hurt and eventually your brain will be hurting too. Study shows that @PERCENT1 of people who are on the computer for to long will start feeling pain in their head. Well I believe that if you stay on the computer to long then you will just get a pain in your head.""@CAPS2! @CAPS2! Oh yeah! What is the answer to the question?"" Have you been off focus and thought about something else? Well most likely you are thinking about a computer. If so then stop thinking about it. Computers can get you off task in class sometimes because you probably are worried about who would be on facebook or not. In this case a computer can get you no where in school so what is the point in thinking about. My final reason is computer can make you forget things like homework or projects. This is bad and not good for your grades. in an instant your grades would go down if you forget things. The cause of this is when you have something to do for school then you would say I will do it later and go on the computer. Well once you get off you might think you have nothing to do because you absorb to much tofu, on the computer. In the end computers can hurt you a lot from school to all sorts of things. I believe people should spend less time and do something else like sports. I urge you to agree with me.",8

And @CAPS1 use them to keep in touch with our friends and family. You @MONTH1 not @CAPS10 it's true, but it is. Have you ever needed to research something? If you have, I am almost @PERCENT1 sure that you used a computer to do it. How do I know this? I know this because it's only common sense to use a computer.

Also @CAPS3 of a hompg book you read for I fact you can just type in the question on the computer. The most important thing is that I stay intouch with my family.

1901,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I stand firm in my belief that technology benefits society. Mostly computers I for one use computers everyday and while I don't really get out much, I don't spend all my time on this machine. First of all, computers provide things for children and aults to do and that helps to lessen crime on the streets. Less crime means happier citizens and less garvage effectively keeping the cities a lot nicer. More people would go out with a definate purpose and might not get involved in some activities they could have if they just wandered around aimlessly. Another reason is that computers provide a way to help contact people you wouldn't meet any other way. There are many sites like deviant art and youtube that can help to find people like that and they also provide a way of getting people together who have mutual interests. I have made a few friends this way myself when I otherwise would normally avoid people in the real world. Lastly, my computer has been able to help me learn various things. I have been able to help my fictional writing by reading fanfiction on the internet. I have also been able to teach my self basic japanese through articles and songs. Actually, I've even been able to teach myself how to access my lower singing range through aforementioned japaness songs. Therefore the internet gives me an outlet to practice my many hobbies. In conclusion I think computers can benefit society in numerous ways. These machines have certinly helped me out during life. I know there's a way to balance real life and play time and we can only hope veryone will find it too.",8
1902,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever thought of how many people are using computers thes days? The number of computer user has increased by so much since the beginning of the creation. I have to say computers can definetly be helpful, but think of all the down falls computers have also kids can go online to sites and talk to complete strangers, instead of doing other things like chores or going inside they stay inside on the computer, and children, particularly, choose to play games on them instead of homework. Now would you like this going on in your house? Online sites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and plain old chatrooms enable children of any conversational age to talk to strangers. On these sites groomers (adults that pretend to be children to get personal info) can be found. Children @MONTH1 not know the dangers of these kind of people so they can fall into the trap. Kids @MONTH1 also lie of their age to get older people to talk to them which can be a bad idea. For it is considered fraud. Some people in chatrooms like to cyber bully also. Cyber bullying can cause a minor depression, which can lead to dangerous acts or even suicide. ""Not now, @CAPS3 I'm playing a game!"", ""I'll be down in a little while"", and ""I'm busy"". Are these statements you hear from your children while they're on the computer? I know my @CAPS3 surely hear it, and it gets annoying! Kids under the age of @NUM1 these days are on the computer so much playing games and talking to friends we barely do anything else, anymore. Back when there weren't any computers kids would play sports, go outside, or even help out around the house. Ever since computers came out though more and more children are sticking to the online-indoor life. This lifestyle can lead to health problems, and who wants those? If you look at our homework list we do not get alot of it but the question: is why isn't this little amount of homework getting done? The answer to this is partically computer's faults. Particularly children these days are picking to go on the computer before or even instead of doing homework. We tell ourselves ""@CAPS4 yeah I'll only go on for @NUM2 minutes then do my homework right after"", but then we forget. Yeah, computers can help us, but they can also drag us down. Missing homework can lead to bad grades, which can lead to a slighter chance of getting into a good college. So, you @MONTH1 be saying computers are still good and helpful, but at least you also got to see the negatives of them. Children talking to strangers, spending more time on the computer then anything else, and using them instead of homework, are all not fantastic qualities. You can still use computers, but at least consider the idea of safer computers, and time charts. In can not only help out your lives but your kid's lives also.",10
1903,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 some people @MONTH1 say that computers are harmful, I strongly believe they benifit society a lot. Three reasons why are, people can develop important typing skills which can be helpful for jobs. Students can use computers as a good source for reasearch and projects, and it's a fun and easy way to connect with friends, or even faraway family. The first reason I chose is that people can develop important typing skills, which can be very helpful when you go on job interviews. "" A lot of big, highpaying, important jobs require knowing to type well"", says rich buisness man, @PERSON1. If you go into a job interview without "" typing well"" on your resumay, then there is deffinitly a smaller chance of you getting the career you want. Another important reason that shows computers are beneficial to societly, is that they help with research for projects and school. Some people would say books are the way to go for reasearch, but computers are faster, easier, and overall more fun and intresting to use. Do your really want students being bored, and unmotivated for school?! My last reason is that using computers can help people connect with others. There's millions of different ways to that fit everybodys needs to communicate with friends and even far away family. For example, my laptop helped my family connect with my cousings, aunt, and uncle from @ORGANIZATION1. We even web chatted with them on @ORGANIZATION2! Don't you think communicating and connecting with long lost familly is amazing? As you can see, computers don't hurt or harm people... They actually do the exact opposite. Computers, help people to develop typing skills for jobs, make it enjoyable and simple to do projects and research, and are a great way to reconnect with family, and connect with friends.",9
1904,"I think that it's not a good idea to be on the computer all day. I only use the computer to go on facebook and check what people are saying on my wall post or messages. Excercising is more important. Everyday of the week i usually go on the computer for a limited amount of time. I'm not addicted to it and i don't let it become a habit. I thnk computers arent even ncoded anymore. We all have major good phones that have better and smarter things on them that just do the exact same thing. You could be walking while your using it. I excercise daily, i think it's important to be healty and strong. People spend way to much time on the computer and don't excersice. If you dont excercise bad things are going to happen to your body and your going to see physical changes. What ever happed to books? In the writing prompt topic it talks about how give us an ability to learn but that doesnt matter. We all need exercise to keep off going and keep us from out. Even if the computer gives us abilitys too. I think computers put to much importan us and its less with information. You have no clue what only one is putting on the internet so just make sure you be about it.",7

On the outher hand computers don't need to just be used as a masive liybrary, it can also be use as a phone and you can talk to outher people from your computer and if you and the person you are talkig to have webcams then the two peopl can see each outher. My friend @PERSON2 and I were on our computers talking to each outher and it was free and unlike a phone we could both see each outher. The presededt @ORGANIZATION1 computers seds that @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION1 all computers are now being made with wed cams in turn for communication purposis. Would can rather pay @MONEY1 a month for a phone bill when you could be using your laptop computer for free? Computers can also be used as an entertainment divice. I can use my @ORGANIZATION2 laptop for playing movies and music and computer games on @CAPS2 or online. But I'm not the only person how dos this because @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people with computers uses them for entertainment. @PERSON1 the precedent @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION2 said that computers these days are being made to play movies on your computer beter than on your huge @MONEY1 inch plasma screen @CAPS3. So why would you spend @MONEY2 on a @MONEY1 inch @CAPS3 if you could just spend @MONEY3 on a desent laptop and whache @CAPS3 and moveis right on your laptop? Would you want your child to be the only one that cant resarch and cant talk to people and not be able to whach @CAPS3 without rasing the cadle bill?",9
1906,"Dear Local Newspaper, I also believe that computers have a positive effect on people, and here are my reasons why. It helps people learn new things, about the earth, animals, nature, and other things. Say your son or daughter doesn't know anything about the digestive system and they have to do a report for school. They can look it up on the computer and learn everything about it. Some people say that people spend to much time on the computer and doesn't exercise or interact with their family. Well people can make a scheduele for computer time and time other things like exercising and spending time with family. It also gives kids something to do when they cant go outside. They can go on the computer, because I rather have a child go on the computer than them playing violent video games. It also helps people keep intouch with friends, because if your friend moved or one of your parents are on a buisness trip. You can use the computer to talk to them or see them on the webcam. Those are the reasons why I think computers have a positive effect on people",7
1907,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 you know how badly the computers are effecting people? Computers are just a lazy way of keeping contact with people. The effects are spending more time on the computer than enjoying nature, less exercising, and interacting with family and friends. Now lets go on to enjoying nature than being on the computer all the time. Why don't you enjoy nature instead of being on the computer? Exploring nature is so much fun. Nature is a great way to meet new people and experience new stuff that you never seen before. You don't want to sit at a desk all day fooling around on the computer. It gets boring after being on the computer so long, but nature, you will never get bored. Enjoying nature is a great way to enjoy your life not wasting it on a computer. Since I wrote about nature, lets move on to exercising more. You don't want your body just sitting there on a chair all day long, @CAPS3 you? No, you want to exercise more with your body. All your doing is exercising your fingers, but why not use your whole body. Being on the computer is not going to help your body exercise at all. Go outside, and at least ride your bike a couple of miles. When you go exercising, you can at least get that blood flowing. Lastly, people should interact with your family and friends more often. Interacting with family and friends is more important than being on a computer. Keeping up with your family and friends is a very important thing because your family are the people that is closest to you and your future family. As us people know, friends come and go, but that is not a reason to have a couple of friends to hang out with. Some people might loose your family and friends by sitting at a computer all the time and not keeping in contact with them. Always interact with your family and friends. Spending too much time on a computer is a waste of time. It effects people by not enjoying nature, not exercising, and not interacting with family and friends. Now that you've heard my opinion, what @CAPS3 you think of it now?",8
1908,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The creation of computers has greatly effected society. People are now connected to each other around the world. I believe this advancement in technology should be welcomed and embraced. Computers teach valuable skills including hand-eye cordination. People can reach information instantly. Lastly, the speed and quality of communication has increased ten fold. To start off, computers are great tools for learning. Young children learn hand-eye cordination by using the mouse while looking at the screen. Sometimes they learn this skill amazingly well. In the medical field, surgery is no longer done by hand, but with elaborate machines controlled by computers. @PERSON1, a @NUM1 year old student of @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION3, is studing to become a surgen. He is amazing with the computer system, not distancing many professional doctors with the new equipment. ""@CAPS1 is all because,"" scientist who have studied @PERSON1 say, ""he used computers sence he was little. This means he has an advanced sence of how they work and what to do when."" This prodigy was born because of computers.The talent of surgens greatly benefits society because better doctors means healthier people. Computers also benefit the information the internet. ""You have @NUM2 messages in your inbox,"" the window says as @CAPS1 pops onto my screen. I open my email, having not checked @CAPS1 for a day. @CAPS1 is filled to the with messages from @LOCATION4, telling me how far away my order is from my house I have an e-mail from @ORGANIZATION2, an article about the @CAPS2 rover. There is another e-mail from my orchestra teacher, reminding the class that the permission slip is due tommrow. All this would not be possible without computers. In a single second, I can know the headline news in @LOCATION6, or @LOCATION1. I can look at pictures from the @CAPS3 countryside, or a live feed from a submarine at the bottom of the ocean. The research for my social studies project was done in an hour with online rather than stay libray. The computer saves time. This means people have more time to exercise and enjoy nature when the monitor is turned off. Would you rather get in a dark, dark libray all day or enjoy the wonders of the world with a click of your hand, and still be in your own backyard to play outside? Also, people can acess data from around the world. Information on how to cook an @CAPS4 dish is available in @LOCATION5. Along with that, medical records are available every where, meaning all information can be combined to get a bigger picture of what your health issue maybe. Computers also improve the quality of comunication. Statistics show that in moder times, @PERCENT1 of meetings take place on a lap top, not in a board room. With video chatting, all of your partners can appear on a single screen sitting on your lap. You can answer and ask questions face to face from opposite sides of the world. This amazing feat would not be possible without computers. Instant messaging also allows for text to be transfer instantly over vast distances. Documents that would have otherwised been forced to send by mail appear at the speed of light in your inbox. This means instead of important documents taking weeks to appear, @CAPS1 takes seconds allowing the things that need to get done to be finished. Schools can take advantage of this by keeping digital copys of worksheets and other important documents insted of physal paper copies. This means less trees are killed. When trees are cut down, they no longer produce oxygen or remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. With meetings taking place on a monitor, people no longer waste fossil fuels trying to get there, sence cars also produce carbon dioxide. Thus, using computers is better for the environment. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people say they prefer sending an email to sending a letter, due to the fact that letter costs money. Computers also alow for more interaction between people. If your father or mother is on a busness trip you can still say goodnight face to face. You can send an e-mail to your sister at college, who never answers her phone due to the time difference. Overall, computers make the world smaller, allowng for better means of communication. Computers are amazing peices of equipment, and I belive, they are a great benifit to society. They teach valuable skills, alow for fast and easy access to information and faster quality communication. Overall, the advancement of computers has benifited, and will benifit society greatly.",12
1909,"In my opinion I think computers are good to have and my three resons are that computers help people be able to learn about new things, talk to friends and family that live far away, and can help you find jobs and help you with your job. My first reason is that computers help people be able to learn about new thing like famos people and places which not many people really want to read a book to learn about when they get go online and see pictures and learn all they need to know about also you can learn new ways to prevent getting sick and how you can treat it @CAPS1 you already are. My second reson is that people can talk to friends and family that live far away because not many people always have time to grab a phone and call them but they do have time to email them. So computers can help keep you together with your frieds and family you rarely ever see. My third reson is that computers can help you find a job but @CAPS1 you already have one it can help you with it because lots of jobs these days use computers for lots of things like money for banks, for kids in school, stuff like that they can help you find a job by showing you different jobs that you can do or what you have to do to be able to do that job you have always wanted to do. In cunclusion I think computers are good and my three resons again are that computers help people learn about new thing, helps you stay togather with frieds and family that live far away, and help people find jobs but @CAPS1 they already have one computers help with the job.",8
1910,"Dear Newspaper, I'm sure you use computers a lot, typing up your articles. Many people in this world now use computers. There are people that work on computers sit on the @CAPS2 all day as their job. You can find so many things on the internet & @CAPS2 I think computers are a positive effect on the society because you can interact, helps the environment and people, and helps remember things. First, computers now are very important and useful. There is always so many kinds of websites that you can meet you date or catch up with you family members. There is many people using facebook and myspace. Now you can instant message them to talk to them @CAPS1, you can find old friends or people in college. Secondly, some people might say oh, @CAPS8 you're on the @CAPS2 you have no social skills but you @CAPS6 you type and talk to people. You even improve your writing skills. @CAPS5, it helps with hand eye coordination. There are many people that has no hand eye coordination like me. When you look at the screen you have to move you hand to get the mouse where you want it. Computers @CAPS1 help you type faster @CAPS8 you type a lot you get practice, just talking to a friends you even improve. These are my reasons why I think computers help our society in interaction. Secondly, @CAPS2 now have everything you can think of from buying food at @CAPS3 & @CAPS4 to textbooks, all you have to @CAPS6 is search it on goodle and there it is. @CAPS8 more people use the textbooks online, than printing @NUM1 page books will @CAPS3. This means it will help the environment. People @CAPS3 cutting down trees because more people are using online books that means animals will keep their home. Secondly, you might think computers give radition, well more & more computers are trying to fix that, to help your heath so its not a danger to be on computers @CAPS5, @CAPS8 more people are buying and using computers they will need more jobs to help build them and sell them. Right now there are alot of people without jobs. So @CAPS8 you keep computers popular there will be a lor more jobs. These are my reason why computers are good for the environment % people. @CAPS5, people can remember things @CAPS8 they have really good memory. For me, I don't have good memory. And i know a lot of people that don't as well. Well that's where computers come handy. There is a button you press on mac computers and it pulls up a ""TO @CAPS6"" @CAPS7 and you can just type in whatever it will be there so you won't have to miss place the paper. Secondly, @CAPS8 you have a @NUM2 page essay you wrote on paper put it in your binder the holes can break and the paper is lot. Then when the teacher ask you where it is you have no clue, @CAPS8 you typed it you can go back in saved files and print it out. You have it. The good things is you get an A not a @CAPS9! @CAPS5, computers you can set something where it tells you every hour to @CAPS6 something. So while your on the @CAPS2 it will say one hour pasted and you can go @CAPS6 whatever you needed to @CAPS6 every hour these are my reason why computers help you remember things. As you can see, there is a lot of positive things when you buy a @CAPS2. There are many people that use computers are a positive effect on the society because you can interact helps the environment & people and helps to remember things.",11

1912,"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I believe that we benifit from computers. We do because computers can benefit society and benefit just regular people. Computers are a great way of comunication for people all over the world. But their not just for communication. Computers benefit society because they help the @LOCATION3, comunicate with places like @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1 who both reasently had earthquakes and instead of a place to find out what they need, come back, get everything together, then going back to its to discover for @MONEY1 of people. We can just click a name and they can tell @LOCATION3 what they need. It also benefits society because the place could go undercover and actually talk to a criminal. He would be able to find out important things like where he lives, his name, people he is with and then they could go and arrest everyone. That has actually happened many times. Computers can also help regular people. Computers can help regular people because they can tell you @CAPS3 with regular updates instead of one in the papers. For example if the newspaper says light snow"". That is what I will prepare for. But what if it takes a turn for the worse; I want the storm hits and then it will be to late. but with the internet I can do @CAPS3.com and I'll know the @CAPS3 worse. Also I would use it to keep in touch with my cousins from so instead of paying @MONEY1 to go see them I can videochat or email them, for free. There are just some of the reason computers benefit everyone. Computers are great for so many reasons more than benefiting and regular people. Computers can be for any thing finding what means to helping @LOCATION2. Computers are amazing things.",8
1913,"Dear @CAPS1 newspaper, @CAPS2 the web, chatting with a friend @NUM1 miles away who you haven't seen in so long, or skyping with your dad while he is on a buisness trip. These are all terrific ways a computer can be used. Now imagine not being able to do any of these things. The computer is a wonderful advancement in technology! Many buisnesses today relie mostly on one. If we didn't have computers many people wouldn't have a job. I believe computers benefit society because they help you contact people. If you need them ergently, are a great pass time on a miserable winter day, and are a reliable sorce of information. To start off computers benefit society because they let you stay in contact with people miles away and contact them quickly if it is ergent. I mean imagine being in a whole other country for a few weeks where your phone doesn't work. If you have a computer you don't have to worry about spending a lot of money buying or using one. A @CAPS3. @PERSON2 from the local newspaper states; ""@PERCENT1 of travelers going on buisness trips bring a laptop, @PERCENT2 of travelers going to another countrey for anything bring their laptop."" This shows that without computers contacting people would be @NUM2 times harder. Additionally, having computers in todays day and age is beneficial to our society because when it is winter and it is way to cold out to think of stepping out the door a computer can be a great pass time. To catch up with friends and family, to organize up coming events, or to just play a game. Even when your sick a computer can be fun. When you are sick you are required to stay in bed. What else would you do other than watch t.v. or go on your computer? As @PERSON1 @CAPS4 in the daily current; ""In the winter computers are used @NUM3 times more."" This concludes that having a computer is a great pass time. Finally, having computers is benifitial to our society because they are a reliable sorce of information. When you are doing homework, or research for your job, computers can save you time and money. Instead of taking ten to twenty minutes in your day and driving @NUM4 miles to a library or your office. You could be saving money on gas and valuable time in your day. Instead you can just log on to your computer and look it up on google. This takes about two to five minutes. As @CAPS3. Gizmo states; ""The average @CAPS6 can save over @MONEY1 a year by using a computer instead of a car. This is why having a computer is benifitial to the society. In conclution computers are very helpful on a day to day basis. Whether you are contacting a friend or family member, or it's to cold to go outside and you are bored, or you need information in a short amount of time, computers can help with many things. Thank you for taking time out to read this. I hope you take it into consideration.",10
1914,@ORGANIZATION1. I believe that computers are a good thing. They are good because they help you in school. They also can help organized and last you can use laptops go places. I know that I use a computer in school everyday. I use this for research on people I dont know like @PERSON1 @CAPS1. @LOCATION1. This brings me to my next point. I also use it for papers I will need to type my paper. This will enable me to write and then save all my work. Not only can the do that but also can keep your paper neat. I don'@CAPS1 have good hand writing so I type my paper. This keeps my work neat. I love computers because they keep you organized. I can have all my work from @NUM1 years ago on a hard drive so I am organized. Also I only have @NUM2 file so I need to have all this stuff in my binder @CAPS2! I just save it on my file. You can also stay organized by using with to transfor things to a diffrent computr or laptop. This will definetly keep me organized. I am horrified that people don'@CAPS1 like computers. You get so much use out @ORGANIZATION1 that like with laptops you can take them with you anywhere. I went to @LOCATION2 and took my laptop and I worked on my schools paper. It helped a lot. They also let you talk to friends and family that you cant usually talk to because you don'@CAPS1 live close. So you can keep in touch with them. I hope that now people love desktops and laptops just a much as I do. Because they help with school staying organized and they have different varietiys and they are on the go. So please keep computer alive.,8
1915,"Dear Local Newspaper: In my opinion, computers have a negative effect on most people. I think this because the internet can give false information; staring at a computer screen all day can cause eye damage; and a person who sits in front of a computer all day can become fat and unhealthy. Continue reading for more details on the opinion... My first reason I think computers have a negative effect on people is because the internet can give false information. For example, if you type in ""dogs"" into a search box on @ORGANIZATION1, you can get results about cats. Did you know that anybody in the world (who owns a computer) can go onto the internet and make a website and false information? Twenty-five precent of internet websites that were meant for learning distribute false information. My next reason I think computers have a negative effect on people is because it could cause eye damage. Studys show that if you sit in front of a computer all day that your ability to see will decrease, little by by little. It's only a matter of time before your eyesight is either poor or completely gone. Another study showsthat @PERCENT1 of teenagers are ""addicted"" to playing video games or being on the computers all day. That's @PERCENT1 of our future generation who will probably not be able to see very well or at all by the time they're @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old. Is that the kind of future you want? My third and final reason I think computers have a negative effect on people is because a person can become fat and unhealthy. These people could chow down on a bag of chips, which have thousands of calories, and not exercise or anything to exort all these calories. Those stored calories will build up and turn into fat cells, and clog arteries and veins and cause massive heart attacks and strokes. In conclusion, there is an extremely negative affect on sitting in front of computer all day for the following reasons: the internet could give you false information; it could decrease eye sight and; these people could become fat and unhealthy. Please take my opinion into consideration.",9
1916,"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I thank that a lot of people uses the computer everyday. For me, I spend a bit of time on the cumputer as somedays. I do sprite comily, write staring, and check information on the internet, and I some times chat with my friends.I enjoy a lot. its in @DATE1 that I go around connec ticut to find the things in nature, like survival. I made a few hunting bows and arrows for me when I can go around the world and survive the elements with some help frum . For studies at home I use the computer for research whether . There really powerful and collect a lot of jewery in rush time. When they wrer extinct they still were cool. In other researches I found a few things fun some health benefits. Theres always some good things fun computers like improving hand eye coordination, music, arts, etc, everytime they use the computers there fingers start getting faster evrytime. Well my last reason and answer is that I agree that using computers is good for something and bad for your hand and eye sight.",7
1917,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you agree that computers benefit your society? Those who support advances in technology believe that computer have a positive effect on people. Instead of being in side on the computer allday you can get some exercise. You can go for a walk. You can go have a social life and hangout with you friends. Would you agree that being on the computer benefits society? Instead of being in the house on the computer all day you can go to the gym. Going to the gym can help you stay healthy. It can also help you stay in shape then you might be able to fit into that stress you bought that was two tight. Also, you might meet a nice man at the gym. So instead of bing on facebook or aim all day get up and go to the gym. Maybe you should go for a walk rather than sit on the computer. Sitting on the computer will just make you fat. Going for a walk daily will make you skinney and healthy. Also, going for a walk daily will help strengthen your bones and mucsles in your legs. Try going for a walk daily instead of sitting on the computer and eating chips all day. Get a life, don't sit on the computer all day. Go have a lunch date with your friends. You might want to take walk with your friend. Have fun going out with your friends. You might want to the bowling alley. So have fun and get a life. So now @CAPS4 you think computers benefit your society? Those who support advances in technology blieve that computers have a positive effect on people. So go the gym make your body be wanted. Take your dog for a walk and watch how it helps your bones and muscles stronger. Get a life go @CAPS4 something with your friends and have a fun time.",8
1918,"Dear Newspaper, Have you ever asked yourself if computers benfit our society? Think about it, everybody uses a computer atleast one hour a day some people are on the computer all day and night. We all rellay so much on computers that if we stop using computers we might not be able to function. We use computers to communicate, store information, keep track of information, tracking shipments, running bisness. Computers are a tool they can help you but they can hurt you to if you are to dependent on computers. You have to be careful how much you rellay on the computers. Also there are criminals who use the computers to hurt you so you have to be careful about what information you put the computer. In conclusion, computers can help and harm you for many defferent reasons. That is why I belive that we shouldn't rellay so much on the computer that we can't function without them. That is why we can't rellay so much on computers.",6
1919,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Are computers helping or hurting? When most people gaze at a lit-up computer screen, they are most likely alone, not excercising, or showing any individual personality. Soon if we continue focusing @CAPS4 time on computers. We will be disconnected from friends, rather that connecting, like those social networks do. Computers are a individual pastime. Multiple people are not ""tweeting"" off of the same computer together. Therefore, you @MONTH1 be talking through electronics to them, but you lack face-to-face experiences. A research was done by @PERSON1, at @LOCATION1, that states @PERCENT1 of children born in the @DATE1 to present will be socialy incapeable by their late @NUM1 due to ""isolation socialization"". We don't want to lose the abilit to connect with the closest to us. Consequently, if we are not experiencing face-to-face talks - there is no personality needed to carry a conversation. Uniqueness is what we're all about! my sister married a hardworking @CAPS1. @NUM2 years ago coming up on their sixth anniversary, their marriage isn't going so well. Last year @CAPS3 recently got a @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 can't stay off it. In the words of my sister- ""@CAPS3 doesn't engage in family moments anymore, and has become a ""robot"". I am starting to fear @CAPS3 won't be a good father for @CAPS4 @NUM3 mont baby on the way. @CAPS3 just never gets off the computer."" @CAPS4 personality change could hurt the ones around us. Techknowledgy is advanced bu that advanced. We are not able to search the web while running or playing a sport. We have to opt out of excercise to do the things your body wants to do. The only body parts moving in typing are your fingers and your hands. That just doesn't cut it. Soon well be the fat, lazy. Space ment women from @CAPS5-@CAPS6 the movie. They just float around in chairs videochating with people and doing other things on their tus/computers. They don't leave their chair once to stop their activity. Therefore they have forgotten how to walk. To answer you questions, computers are hurting us. They are blackholes that suck the personality out of us, and isolate us. We are equivalent to lifeless blobs of accumiliating, fat, when hypmotize by a computer.",9
1920,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effect(s) computers have on people is that computers can have both a negative and positive effect. From @CAPS1 opinion I lean more towards negative even though I do enjoy computers. @CAPS1 reasons for why I lean more towards negative is because it's a waste of time, you could get put into very dangerous situations, and not thinking properly. @CAPS1 first reason why I think computers are a negative effect on people is because it's a waste of time. Instead of using your time wisely with activities you could or should do your on the computer. You should be writing your five page essay but instead your on facebook or playing an online game. When your on the computer is distrants you from work you must be doing, which is important and will just be a mess later on. This is a situation I can also relate to. I suppose to be writing a paper for english class but instead I was playing on the computer and wasted over an hour and could've just got @CAPS1 paper done with. @CAPS1 second reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because you could get put into very dangerous situations. Some people think chat rooms are fun and nothing bad could ever happen but chat rooms are very dangerous. Thousands of online predators try talking to kids younger and meet them in person, which is extremely dangerous. Many people out there try to harm other humans emotionally and physically. So you never want to try talking to strangers in any way because it can lead you into a bad situation down the road. @CAPS1 third reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because it takes away your energy and you don't think properly when on the computer you tune out everything around you and not pay as close attention to things like you should. Even though computers can be fun you should take a break and do something even more useful such as a physical activity. Computers can distract you from doing physical work your body needs which leads to lazyness. Lazyness is not healthy for your body and can cause you to a health related problem and you @MONTH1 need medical attention. So as you see computers can be very negative towards people and cause many problems. I hope you keep in mind what I have written.",9
1921,"Dear To who this @MONTH1 consirn, Computers… They are great for when it comes to projects, papers, and fun. I think that computers have a sum what good effect on people because up untill a few years ago most people didn't even know how to use a computer. Now a days computers help people in many ways, they help with reports and projects. Computer keep getting better and better as the years go by. Now they have edvanced enternet, and have even added a new edvanced microsoft word, you can do powerpoints, brosures, and even invitations. Computers had had a great effect on people because some people have children that they have to take care of all day or when they get home from work. The computer can help entertain children. Children can go and play games, watch moves or depending on their age even connect with friends. One of the features of the computer has made a big effect on people is the webcam. The webcam has helped people connect with old friend, distint relitives, or eyed a child thats off at school. As you can see computers had effected people in many ways. But one other reason is work. Some people work from home so they can be a stay at home parent or even take care of someone close. Either way they stay connected with, emplyies, they boss, or even clients. People take alot of vacations, but they also work, so they just bring their laptop with them and their ready to go. So as you can see computers had effected peoples lifes in big ways, weather its work, entertaing kids, or just having fun. The computer is a big help to every person.",8

College @CAPS1 from @ORGANIZATION1 observes that @PERCENT1 of people who spend a majority of their time on computers gain weight because if all you do is eat sleep and go on the computer, what exercise are you getting in that life style. This is a perfect example of why you should limit your time in computers. Aniother reason why you should limit your time on computers is that you are risking your chance of losing your friend or friends. What I mean by this is that if you have your mind get on the computer you will start to choose it our your friends and site, of what is important to you. Your friend @MONTH1 even not want to be friend any more because they are sick of being chosen over by a computer. @CAPS4 @CAPS2, creator of the computer says, ""@CAPS3 I make the computer, I was , and time my friend would call to get a drink, with me I always told him I was busy on the computer. He eventually didn't to and with I becoming obsessed the computer. ""That is know @CAPS4 @CAPS2 his : from . If you don't want to loose , your computer . My limit yopur time is because your grades will drop. pricipal , @CAPS6 of their on computers once of their because @CAPS3 student have from school, they straight the computer @CAPS3 they should be doing their homework or studying.",8
1923,"Dear newspaper editor, I've been hearing alot of discussion about the computer issues. In my own opinion I feel that computers are a great thing to learn about and can really benefit from computers helps you find information alot quicker, lets you talk to family/ friends far away and also helps with alot of school assignments. People always talk about how they want to travel the world and see/visit different places well if people really wanted to find quick and easy information about that particular place. It's way easier expecally because about every house in the @CAPS1.S has a computer so many things go by faster. For exmaple say that you wanted to find some information about birds, not every person has a book about birds and time to go to the library and if you had a computer all you would have to do was look it up and have your questions answered. Alot of people are moving and when I say moving I mean far away. Alot of people wonder haw they would keep i'll touch with there family? They can write letters but it would take way to long. They could buy plan tickets to visit, but right now in this recetion nobody really has enough money to pay for it. So what's a cheaper way to talk to your family and see them as well? Webcam webcam is an easy way to talk to family and friends easally and now every labtop made has one and it is very easy to connect. It's when you able to see them and talk to them at the same time as long as you event for as long as you want. In the @DATE1 technology has grown rapidly. More technology has been put into schools, homes and even building. More school cure starting to give alot of assignments with computers needs. I've been seeing that alot of teachers have been giving us alot of writing assignments with us having to research alot of things. Also that we have to type alot of papers. They are making computers a big part of education now and making technology take part in it too. Ifee it is a good combination. To some up up my easy I do feel that computers has a big benefit to society and helps us solve alot of issues. As the years go on not just computers but alot of other electronics will be very normal to human life.",8
1924,"Dear @CAPS1, I think that computers don’t have a negative effect on people. The computer can teach you about @CAPS4 things easier, and it allows you to talk to people @CAPS2, people can be on when they use the computer or not. On the computer, you can learn about anything. For example, there are @CAPS4 websites that allow you to search any topic and you will get a lot of information on that topic. @CAPS2, there are websites, such as @LOCATION1, where you can find the definition f words fast and easy. It takes along time to search through dictionary, but with this websites, you can do it much faster. @CAPS3 say that you want to buy a car, but you want to learn more about this can to make sure its the right choice. Well, with a computer you can do that I are let you learn about cars with video and more. There is no way that is a back affect @CAPS3 say you want to talk to somebody but someone else is on the phone. Computer you can go on the internet @CAPS4 sites let you chat will you find. This can be goal because a like here could happen. Its @CAPS2 guide when because @CAPS5 like to reply. People let do They said that computers have a effect on because they werent got they outside but what they use the computer. They will get bored of the computer at some point. At sometime they will run out oxf stuff to learn. Then they will go out and do activities get exercise and spend time will family and friends. I for one, do that too. When I get home from school I do my home work computer. On the computer I check a few things and then get off. After that I go and @CAPS6 you see, people know when to get off the computer and get excercise. Computers don't here a negative effect on More like they help people. They teach us stuff, helps get who quickly are talk to friends faster. everthing that a computer does is positive.",8
1925,"Dear local newspaper, I have herd about a problem of computer usage. Also some benefits with the computer. But I believe that computers shouldn't be stoped being used. They help you in homework, directions, and stores which helps you a lot. First in homework you can use the computer for typing on essay. And if your not a good speller, you have the spell cheaker on microsoft office to help you. So that you dont get a @CAPS1- from all and your spelling mistakes. When you would of had a @CAPS2+ on it. A computer also helps you with homework by helping you see what was for homeworks for tonight if you forgot to wright it down or if you were sick. I now you could call a friend, but what if your friend was in a different core. So all you have to do is go onto your school website and go to the teacher's site and see whats the homework. Also a computer helps you with directions. It helps you by starting at your house to you exact locashion. So if your new to the city/suberb you don't find yourself lost, and don't know how to get back home. You just need to go to internet, then to google map and type in your house and destanashion. It shows you the rout and you can print out the directions to have it with you. And on the map it has on the side how many miles on what street/rout you need to go. So you don't have to guess. But I know there are @CAPS3's. But I don't like them. Once my uncle go a @CAPS3 an wanted to try it out when he came over to my house while he was driving. He new how to get here but, when he got on my streeet he said that the @CAPS3 folled him that he was in the woods, and didn't show a street. So thats why I stop to using computer with my directions. Lastly a computer helps you with stores. With a computer you can go to a stores website and look at what they have for close or sales etc. So you done find your self on a @NUM1 hr hunt for a toy or pair of boots when it should only take @NUM2 min. Also a computer can help you with resturant raitings. By going to the resterounts websit you can see reviews and raitings and prices of their food, and opinnions on the resturaunt. So that you don't find yourself with bad. One time I was at a resteraunt for lunch with my family. And everyone got there order except my brother @PERSON1. And the wator said it will be here soon. @NUM3 mins later he got his burger. I know thats enough time to make a burger from scrach. So they tecnicly forgot my brothers order. And we didn't give a big tip. Computers arn't bad for people. They can help you a lot. They can help with typing for homework, directions to a store and stores sales. So computers are helpfull throughout our daily lives.",9
1926,"Dear Readers, @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 think that computers are fun, exciting, and the way of the future, it's not! I mean come on you can never go wrong with shopping online. That's how I felt until I got taste of my own medicine, my friend ignored me to be on the computer, and it hurt, so i decided to take a look at how it's changed everyone. Parent's and children of all age's, how many time's have you gone online and little match making pop-up appears on you screen? have you ever just to just to see who you'll if so then the parents who are reading my letter, talk to your children about the dangers of online match making. There are lots and lots or perverted adults waiting to find senceless kids to minipulate or ""chat"" with. Now children, teens, and young adults is not a making way from that in a while and visualize the @CAPS2 healthy, stay action stay away from the computer, just remember, there's always testing!",6
1927,"Dear @LOCATION1 newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a bad feeling about computers? Well I @CAPS1. Over the years I've seen computers ruin peoples health and lower students grades at school. People truly would be better off with out computers. Taking walks, or going for a run, are all activitys which will keep you fit. But sitting down at a computer is not. My older brother @CAPS2 would always stay on the computer playing games on the internet for hours at a time. As days, weeks, then months went on our family began to notice alot of wait gain on him. As he began to spend less time on the internet and more time exersising he losed some weight so that @CAPS2 was health again. I've also noticed that its more tempting to eat a bag of chips then to eat a carrot while on the computer. It takes a while to prepare health food then it is with unhealthy foods. Over a peird of time all the junk food you've been eating with harm your health. Last year my friends father had a heart attach because be had too much fat blocking his heart. If he were eating good food such as carrots, chicken, and tomatos his heart attack could have been prevented. That is why my friends farther spends less time on the internet, giving him more time for health food you would never stare into a light both for hours so why would you look into a computer for that long? Dr. @PERSON1 from @CAPS4 @CAPS5"" my studies show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS6 waring glass, eyes, have been harmed be common things like your television, and computer. I wont to live a long healthy life and will not let computer's stop me. The internet can be an important object in your adulecents life, but it can also be the most dangers. Over the years there has been about @NUM1 kidnapping in @LOCATION2 each year. My cusin @PERSON2 found a person on my space who said he was fifteen. He even had a picture of his young self on the computer. It turns out he was now forty years old. I'm not saying not going on the computer will stop you from metting these kind of people but it will precent your children from it. Not only that but computer effect your sleep. When I was in @NUM2 grade I spent hours on the computer. At school I was tierd and found it diffcult to learn. Suprisingly I wasnt the only one have trouble sleeping. A person named mike found it difficult to sleep because he always wanted to be on the internet when he wasnt on. When we both notice the internet was causing my grades to go down and harming mikes sleep. We decided not to go on any longer and tell no adult about mikes sleeping problems. With out computers the world would not be perfect but it would be a better place. I hope that you will not let computers harm you and your family. Please keep my letter and consider my idea.",9
1929,I think computer's are good to use. The first reason why I think is good because if we did not have any computer's we could'nt go on @CAPS1 and all types of fun stuff I think life would be kinda boring. My second reason is life would be boring without computers is because we cound'nt comuncaite with our friends or family wat if we did not have cell phones how would we talk to them so I think we should have computer's. The next reason is what if we has to do a school project and we needed a computer wit h internet what could we do have to write it by hand so at some point I think computer are good to work with like if we needed to find out how to get some place we would need a computer or a gips either one. In conclusion so I think we need computers to do fun stuaff to help us if we needed to find out how to get somewear or do something fun like play games go on @CAPS1 and all that kninda stuff. That's why I think we need computer's the end.,6
1930,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think the idea to let people use computers is a good idea. This is because @CAPS1 can help with any school subjects, @CAPS1 can keep you keep in touch with family and friends, and you can even look up and places/destinations. Therefore, I think the effects computers have on people are good. The first reason why I think computers are great for people is because @CAPS1 can help both adults, teenagers and kids with school/education. Computers have a good effect on teenagers because if there was any reason why a teenager wouldn't be allowed to attend college classes they would have another opportunity to take them online. The compuetr helpd adults with college also, if they were to go deal wtih computers whether they worked in an office, or even from home. The computer can also help teenagers and kids because they, or their parents, would be able to look up their homework, or vene if they missed work in school because they were absnet, they would be able to chech that up. In the end, computers are a good effect on people because @CAPS1 can help them with their schooling and education. Another reason why @CAPS1 hink computers are good effect on people is because they can help friends and family stay in touch. Now-a-days were are social networking sites such as facebook, and @CAPS4 where peole can stay iun touch. If nay person had a family member of friend that lived out o f the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that person would be close to email them and even video chat wiht them. Otherwise, you can them on facebook and you would be bale to look at pictures of them or even send them messages to keep in touch. Teenagers like to also video and on to keep in touch with each other or even like to I.M each other on @CAPS4. A reason why adults can use the computer is because if they were to use a website the use the computer to stay in touch with that person. Therefore, the computer not only could be used for schooling and education, @CAPS1 can also be used for people to stay in touch with one another. The last reason why I think computer are a good effect on peole is beacuse they would be able to lok up places. People sometimes like to look up places where they will be travelling to; so they can find out more about that place. For example like the people, the economy, the money they use etc. You would also be able to look up pictures of how that play looks whether @CAPS1 looked beautiful and different than any other place you're seen or if @CAPS1 looked casual like any other place. For example when my family and I had gone to the @LOCATION1 over break mu parents would constantly look @CAPS1 up online to find out information and to see what @CAPS1 looked like. However, not only can you use the computer to find out information of a place or pictures, you can also find an address of @CAPS1. Therefore, being able to use the computer can help a person find out any inforamtion about any place. Overall, I think computers have a great efefct on people because @CAPS1 could help them with school or any education, @CAPS1 could help people stay in touch with family and friends, and lstly, peopel would be bale to look any up any information or any kind of place.

1931,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 is spending a lot of time on computers. They don’t spend time doing other things like exercising. Spend time with your family and enjoying life. You should spent less time on the computers and more time with your family because if your on the computer all day your family going to think your at bthe family anymore because you never be around. And you dont want that to happend thats why you should spend a little more less time on the computer and more time with your family. Another reason is if you keep on getting on the computer and play games it could get you stupid you should enjoy your life and do something postive with your self instead of getting on the computer all day. If you do that, that mean you have no life. My last reason is you shoud go to the gym and go exercise instead get on the computer. I said that because is on the computer you could get fat, and you be so into the you dont even wanna cook your In conclusion thats what you should do all said and because sometimes stuff like that could get you dumb.",7
1932,@PERSON1 ~~~~@CAPS1: @NUM1 @CAPS2: @NUM2 The computers always have had a good affect on people. This is so because they are able to help people in there time of need with the online doctors you can book youâ€™re appoint. This is so much than getting stuck on hold. Next the computers are a great way to meet people after you talk to them you can get to gather and have a great time with your new best friend. On the other hand there are many people online want to hurt you in more ways than one. Another good reason is computer video games. I love these types of games like all teens do. Also this makes a great way to make friends you can play to gather. This dose take away time out side but you can by inside booking a camping trip also you can book a @DATE1 get way this is perfect to get out of work or just call in sick and off you go. I hope this has helped you see that there are manly good things from a computer.,6
1933,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the rise of computers effect on teens, adults and children is good. For adults, having a computer is useful for work, and communication. For teens, it is useful for schoolworks, communication and fun. For young children it is useful for fun and learning. I remember when I was younger I of educational games on my computer. I especially enjoyed with, and now for the seven years I have been taking with classes a grade above. This shows the effect a computer could have on a childs education. Also, for teens, having a computer could help them research something for a report. With this research, their project would valid. Also, if somebody forgot what their homeworks was the could ask their friend via @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. This is why computers help with schoolwork. This ties into my next reason, communication. If I forgot my homework I could easily just and a friend to email it to me or past it on @CAPS1. Without computers, there would be no way to get lost of forgotten homework. Also, a computer is a good way to communicate with friends. ""@CAPS3 to my friends @CAPS1 sometimes I'll end up hanging and with that person says local @PERSON1. A recent poll found that @PERCENT1 of all middle school students have a computer with service in their house. Students would benefit from having computers. Friends would benefit also and so would adults. This is another reason why people should use computers. Don't you think that after a long day of school, just want to relax and. Well, for fun computer a play video games. such as and people to play. Over @NUM1 on the internet, and kids would like to play than @NUM2 students said that they play games on the internet and enjoy it. Also fantasy baseball and basketball etc. are great ways for people to learn to manage a learn about players, and have fun. Without the use of computers, following a sports than would be very difficult. This is one last reason why having a computer is a good thing. In conclusion, computer are good because of the educational value, communication, and fun. What do you think? Do you want to take away all these opportunities from people or all ages? If not, we a computer.",8
1934,"Imagine a world without computers. What would it be like? For one thing, taking attendance in schools would be much harder than it is right now. It would be much harder and less efficient to take attendance on paper and there would be a much greater likelihood for error. Computers pros out weigh their cons by a long shot, because they simplify everything an make it much more user friendly, they drive almost every man-made thing in the world, and they will reduce the amount of paper we as humans use to make books and other materials. What would having to spend hours looking through dozens of books just to find one little peice of information feel like? Certainly not many kids in todays world would know, given that over @NUM1 of the worlds books are already digitized and you can access them all with just a little click on a keyboard. Most teachers and school administrators do not seem to understand that a little thing called wikepedia is a lot more efficient less time-consuming and a lot less tedious than looking through books. Computers are a great source of information for getting what you want when you want it. You can even search the simplest things, such as the temperature and the humidity. Businesses use microsoft, xcel to graph data, and most of our money is not in dollar bills it is in cyberspace, not even real. As you can see computers really can simplify and make everything a whole easier. My second reason that computers can have and do have a positive effect. On people is because virtually every man-made thing today has a computers of same sort in the cars have computers that automatically call @NUM2 if you get into an accident. Some newer guns, such as the cornershot have computers on them. Even @NUM3 childrens toys that you buy on the streets have computers. Imagine what would happen to @LOCATION1 if its grid network failed. Because all of its traffic lights sewer systems and especially the stock worksheet all run on computers, or in some cases one single computers if they failed their would be mass hysterio. Some people would lose everything they had, and everyone taking the metro or subway would be trapped where they were. Life would be hell without computers. Third, computers reduce the amount of paper used to make books and other materials. Schools alone waste over half of the @LOCATION2's paper supply so the tree hugging should be jabbling at the schools instead of major corporations. Most of todays books and other forms of literature are already digitized.",10
1935,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1 town times, @CAPS2 the computer can be very beneficial to the people of our town. It helps us to communicate with one another. From what I understand some experts from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 The Society say that people are not going outside to exercise and are becoming obesie. I understand that this can be a problem but htere are many other reasons why @CAPS2 the computer is a benefit for everyone such as, researching for many projects and work related things, having the ability to comunicate with friends, and the fact that we can learn about so many subjects as the tips of out fingers. Furthermore let me tell you more about why computers are so useful. In a recent study at @ORGANIZATION1 done by the Computers of the @ORGANIZATION2. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 freshman through sophmore students and if they did not have computer, most of their projects for @ORGANIZATION1 would not @CAPS4 as good of a grade as they did. But of all of these students @PERCENT1 of them used @ORGANIZATION3 search engine to @CAPS4 their info. For example, @PERSON1 was asigned a project that called for her to use her computer and nothing else. On that project she recieved an A+ because she knew where to last for what she maded to find. Clearly almost all students know how to @CAPS4 good, factual info and explain it in their work. To say they dont go outside enough might be true but how else would they @CAPS4 a good grade. In addiction to what I have just explained to you I would now like to talk about second networking, @CAPS5. @PERSON2 recently talked on his show about how networking such as @CAPS6 @CAPS7 an @CAPS8 have made teen lives totally different. "" They can know become closer to friends just by the click of a mouse"", says @PERSON2. Not only is he right but, if teens were not on tthe computer as much, they might not have as many friends. Also, moms and dads are mostly working and are not. able to drive their kids to their friends house as these networking sites are how kids most communicating. Futhermore, In a recent statistic state by the international @CAPS9 @CAPS10, @PERCENT2 of all teenagers found out the news from the internet. From my own personal experiences I found out about the earthquakes in @LOCATION2 by looking at recent photographs taken. Now I that kids should take more time out of their shcedules to go outside and play with friends but going on the computer is a way of us relaying and to catch up with what is happening in our society. If we had nowhere to relax then we would probably have to watch alot more of the news and we all know working television does not help you in the long run. From the facts stasted above, surely going on the computer is resourseful and could be used often because it help kids @CAPS4 excellent grades on, projects having the ability to use social networks, and the will catch you up with the news I know that computers and one of the use resources and know you do too.",10
1936,"It has been said that people are the computer alot nowadays, but who said that was a bad thing? It's a great way to stay connected with anywhere. It also teaches a lot and about anything. Finally all the skills you get from a computer can help you get into a good school or get a good job. So hopefully you will see how this can be a good thing. Having a computer is a great way to talk to people without jackin up the phone bill. You can talk to your friends or family no matter where they are even in a forign country. You can email them or even talk to them on a chat so like they're fight there. You can even video video chat is a great even for doing a business or having a family get together. Thats one why using the computer is not a bad thing. You can learn anything you need to know on the computer. You how to speak a different language and learn about their countrys. Instead of your time looking information about something you can for it. Many people think that a good education you have to go college. is not always the. in the future. So as you have read the internet can people successfull in life. Now I hope you see how people using the computer more can actually benefit them. It's a great communication device, teaches people a lot and can help people get into good colleges and get good jobs.",8
1937,"Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 times, @CAPS3 @CAPS4! As these words flash across your television you go straight to your @ORGANIZATION1 to find the scoop. About what just happened. While your finding information you tap away @CAPS5 the keys like there's no tommorrow. And before you know @CAPS5 you've finished your article for tommorrows newspaper. Without computers you would only have the manimal details @ORGANIZATION1 the stories about countries half way found the world. To begin, if computers were not helpful and important would schools teach children how to use and create projects with them? According to @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 the @ORGANIZATION1 technology, ""Computers are important to our youth and not only do they enjoy using them, but @NUM1 out @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM2 young adults study more efficiently while using a @ORGANIZATION1."" @CAPS5 school we use computers for everything I can't tell you how many papers I have typed on the @ORGANIZATION1 in my @NUM1 years @ORGANIZATION1 schooling I know that computers help dozens @ORGANIZATION1 kids study too. The social studies book that my class uses has an online textbook with many study tools and resources to use and I score @CAPS5 least @NUM4 points better on tests and quizzes when I use those resources. Which brings me to my next point, computers are fun to use to chat with friends. Social networking sites like @CAPS6, @CAPS7 and @CAPS8 messaging are helpful when contacting friends about homework, meeting up or even having just a friendly conversation. Experts who say ""People are spending to much time on their computers and less time interacting with family and friends"" are contradicting themselves beacuse people every where interact online with their long distance family and friends whether would have no way @ORGANIZATION1 contacting otherwise and make plans with their other family and friends. Finally, in fifth and sixth grade the students in my district had to take a @ORGANIZATION1 class that taught hand-eye coordination and fast reacting time which can be helpful outside @ORGANIZATION1 school and in sports, computers teach and can even sometimes teach better than teachers can. My cousin takes online courses for school so without computers she would not be learning as much. Computers are important to society in this day and age whether that be getting info on world @CAPS4, contacting friends and family or learning new and important subjects.",10
1938,"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers do have a positive effect on people. I believe this because of @NUM1 reasons. One, kids can use the computer to do homework. Two, adults and kids can use the computer to view news and what's going on. Lastly, it gives people the ability to talk with others through the web. These are my @NUM1 reasons why I think computers have a positive effect ohn people. Reason one why I think computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives kids the ability to do their homework faster and with more acurate information. According to ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" more than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 rush through their homework and just write down random answers. If a computer was avalible not only will they be getting it done in the same time but the answers would be correct and they would be learning. All because of these being a computer handy kids can now do good in school and still enjoy the outside and other activities they love doing. This is one reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. Reason two why I think computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives them the access to view the news and what is going on in their area. Some people end up late to work because they didn't know that there was a wreck on the road and it took a while to take care of. I'm pretty sure their boss wasn't to happy when he or she came in late. But if a computer was handy the person could of looked online and saw that and could of found an alternate route to get to work. This is another reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. My last reason why I think computers have a positie effect on people is because it gives people access to chat with people online. Now a days they have college online which is a good idea. Without a computer people can't use or even look into oppertunities like that. In ""@CAPS3 @CAPS2"" it states that @PERCENT2 of people don't attend college. With a computer people can go to college right from their house. This is my last reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. By reading this essay I hope that I have persuded you that computers have a positive effect on people for three reasons. It allows kids to do homework, give people access to news, and allows online chatting. I hope you take my letter into consideration of how computers do have a positive effect on people. Thank you.",9
1939,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers comsume many hours of what could have been productive time everyday. Although the internet is a great way to stay updated witj current events, it is also very dangerous. Computers lead to cyber bullying weight gain and drapped gradesi which is why I feel they have a negative effect on citizens around the world. As you know teens across @LOCATION1 spend countless hours instant messaging, going on @CAPS8 or @CAPS2, and uploading pictures that anyone can see. However, a good praction of the teen experience the torture of cyber bullying. Children are very much emotional we are still trying to understand the world. With new pressure, the bst thing we need is more drama. However, Computers lead to @CAPS10. This is where a victim is teased or harrassed by someone online. Sometimes, you @MONTH1 not know who this person is. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of the teenagers who were cyberbullied are depressed or commit suicide. It is hard enough to be a teen, bit computers just add more stress; and somtimes ends lives. Obesity is a growing problem in @LOCATION1. Adding on the distraction of television, @CAPS3 everywhere are losing excersize. I have realized that ever since I received my own laptop, I have spent less time excersizing and more time eating. Not only are computers time sonsuming but also lead to drama. as more drame occurs usually eat more. Computers have a large effect on weight gain mostly because of the @CAPS4 for fastfood restaurants. Everywhere you look you could find flashing ads about @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS5 @CAPS6. This os encouraing unhealthy eating all around our country but the world. Computers effect the everyday health of humans. Ever wonder why your child is failing school? It could be because they spend too much time on the computer. Internet serves as a distraction all over the world erasing the thought of having to do homework. The more time teens spend on the computers they grow tired and forget about their nightly assignment. Not completing homework for a certain amount of time could lead to dropped grades. Not only does internet effect dropped grades but online games do too! websites suck as addictinggames.com are time consuming. They talk away time that could have been spent doing homework. Also, with the drama that takes place on @CAPS7 or @CAPS8 @CAPS3 might not be able to concentrate on school work out at all. Computers serve as distractions that lead to low grades. I hope you have come to find the dramatic effects computers have on humans. In one day @CAPS9 lose countless hours of precious time just because of a machine. Computers lead to @CAPS10 weightgain, and dropped grades. No wonder @CAPS9 are so stressed! Therefore, I believe computers have a negative effect on people around the world. Thank you for your time!",10
1940,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Technology is a big part of our lives in the twenty-first century. Everybody has a cell phone, iPod, and computer. It really makes you wonder if advance in technology are really a good thing. I believe that the effects computers have on people are very good. Computers give us thousands of answers, allow us to enjoy entertainment, and even talk to online friends and chat. Computers are great! Computers are a way to find information about thousands of topics. Have you ever wanted to travel to @LOCATION1? If you jut typed in @LOCATION1' into the search box, millions of websites would pop up in a matter of seconds. If you need directions to the nearest pizza restaraunt, you can just look it up and you will find it. Finally if you need to find a definition to a word in your novel, you can go on to the online dictionary and figure out what it means. @CAPS1, are you now seeing how computers are a great way to find useful information about a variety of topics? Well, computers alos allow us to be very entertained too! Computers allow people to pretty much do whatever they want. They have all sorts of websites that are very entertaining. On computers, you can play hundreds of really fun games. You can choose your ability, level, and @CAPS4 even your character. You can play against people @CAPS4 and it is very fun. Computers can also allow you to read articles about whatever you are interested in. You can read about the local news in your area, and even log on to your local newspapers website and read the breaking news. Oops, I missed my favorite show that was on @TIME1. Don't worry, you can watch it online. @CAPS1, are you now seeing how entertaining computers are? Computers also allow you to chat with your friends too. Computers are a way to stay in touch with your friends whom you @MONTH1 not see everyday. You can just send them an email, and then they can reply right back to you. Also by using @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and other websites you can talk to friends and @CAPS4 you can even do a video chat, where your friend and you are both sitting at the computer and actually physically talking to each other. @CAPS1, are you now seeing how you can talk to your friends and really enjoy yourselves by using a computer? Technology is something that is really a great thing today. It helps us to research things that we care about and give us answers with one click. It also helps us to do things such as watch videos, read articles, and play games. We can even talk to friends. @CAPS1, computers are a great tool that are really good for people to use and own!",9
1941,"Dear @CAPS1 team @NUM1, I saw your ad in the paper and thought i would share my opinions. I believe most people enjoys those family more than a computer, but that doesn't mean they can't go on the computer. If you space time used when the computer instead of long period of time then those concerns would go down. Out of @NUM2 people asked @PERCENT1 have used a computer and still talk when family and get outdoor. Though there is many concerns, they are benefits and using both to keep more managable life. many experts worry because some people are on the computer for hours at a time. This is a concern but I'm sure these people still got out side and exercise. However, not everyone. so if you are sitting on the compuer for hours then you at a higher risk of getting over weight, and not getting to explore nature, Everyone need to get at least @NUM3 minutes of exercise of at least outide activitys such us baseball, football, soccer, tenis and swimming. If sports aren't your favorite then you can hangout with some friends and family. Computers are a great thing but to much can be a very regretful experience. Although computers can have a negitive effect on people, they are extremely helpful to todays society. If kids are having trouble in school they can be tutored online or can talk to someone help. Also, in todays working society computers are used, so knowing how to use are and having hand and eye coordination is a wonderful quality. People that like to travel can map out a trip and pre order items like maps, hotels, plane tickets, and emails that will be happening where they go. If you don't know how to use a computer you @MONTH1 be out jobs. I believe that more people schools use computer for short periods of time and still have time to exercise. This idea @MONTH1 be a better way to keep people more healthy and keep their knowledge to a modern day level. Many benefits and concerns could be brought to agreement. Using free time to use the computer and learn about subjects in school and outside interact like skatebording and guitar or even dancing. So many different people can be interested in computers but you have to make sure that your getting proper exercise and spending time with family and friends. Overall I thinkg people that can not seem to got off computers need a job similar to what they like on computers. For example, if you like racing cars, then you can be a technical engineer. If you like to cook then you can take classes online if your busy a lot. So using both benefits and the concerns you can move life a better for you and others. Weather its too much computers and not enough time outside, with proper time use with computer runy people will be fit and have a better knowledge. Getting peoples ideas and thought can make a society more functional and more knowying about computers and these effects on people.",10
1942,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I believe that computers are bad in many ways, even though they have advantages. I believe that @LOCATION1 depends on computers too much. For example, what if @CAPS4-@CAPS5 decides to @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS1 coast? Entire buissnesses would be lost. Almost every family's savings would also be lost. There would be chaos everywhere. Another thing that happens is that computers fill in job opprutunities so that now the economy is affected. People won't make enough money to buy the things that the computers make. Another crazy thing about computers is that people who use them dont get enough exercise. I mean isn't @LOCATION1 fat enough already? We should all be getting outside for at least @NUM1 hours per day. So whether its exercise terrorists, or just a bad economy, Computers are ruining the world that we now know and love.",6
1943,"Dear newspaper, I think computers are a positive influense on society. Because the noleg it gives us and the many uses it has for our country and socity today in our generation of tecnology. Haveing computers benefits us in so many way's like helpin us find information on a school project. Also to comunicate with others and have fun on sum of the game sites that provide varius things that we need or want. If you were to do a sorve of how many people have a computer or use one I think you would get @PERCENT1 of our population. Even if it does cause problems with berth I dont think people could go on with there jobs schooling and stuff like taxes when time comes. Last but not least people say that when you use the coputer your not relly doing anything but I beg to difer because when your on the coumputer you always pick up something you didn't know that important. I learning is exercise what is it takes more energy to learn then to run or walk or play outside for an hour a least there not watching cartoons or some outher redicules show insted there learning not roting there brain watching @CAPS1. So in counclusion I think computers are the best thing that was ever invented because all of what you can do on them the cool information that you can find this is why I think that it benefits socity in so many ways.",8

Computers can help people in school with information for. Homework and find they need. So kids wouldn't have any reason not to have there homework done. On the ohter hand it could be bad with all the new things but today like phone kids can cheat on tests if they wanted to. Computers can also be bad for your health. People tend to get lazy and want to stay on computers to long and play world of warcraft this is same what of a bad because your foced to eat when your in.

1945,"Dear the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to you about the latest topic has going around. is if computers benifit our society. I will tell you about the good and bad opinions about spending time on the computer and how it help us in our everyday lives. Some of the good things that computers bring to our society is learning. Even adults learn new stuff on computers. You can go on websites and learn new things like a new language, if you never graduated out a diploma. go to college and many others. Some people think that a computer is just can look up online. But it's not only good for that. There is social networks like twitter, facebook and myspace. You can have to friends @NUM1. Also people can connect with their work or schools. Now there always has to be a bad side to everything. Some of the bad things to people on all. Instead that could be out with friends or family, enjoying a walk, and out. And once you get online and become part of something you get addicted for being on the internet all. Another thing we can be for computers are machines. Machines can be used for everything. If its for entertainment, programing, building or surgery. Now almost every hospital is using some kind of machine in over, at @MONTH1. In most our companys it is not people building the cars. It is people controling the machines that build car. In any kind of house/ building / warehouse you will have I machine. Or at least I. As you can see in this letter that we can't live without computers in our everyday lives. We have are around us time. We will always wander why computers weren't softly enough.",8
1946,"Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1 without computers is just a waste of time. Computers were designed to ease the work of some bothersome activities. Computers are positive because it is simple to write essays with, there are many educational aspects to them and there is always new and developing technology to learn about. In @ORGANIZATION1, essays will always be assigned. Computers greatly help with this because students don't have to write everything by hand. The computer makes the writing easy to read and edit. It makes a long job very quick and easy. Spell check features teach proper spelling and grammar usage by showing if corrections are needed. This leads to an overall higher quality essay that is easy to correct, all from a computer. However, that's not the only way computers help in @ORGANIZATION1. On any computer, there are ways to extend your education even further than @ORGANIZATION1. There are many @CAPS2 and sites that provide lessons that relate to @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""A computer is a great way to extend childrens knowledge on a topic. Most are simple to use, and they're fun!"" @CAPS2 keep kids interested while they develop more learning skills for the future. This electronically powered machine is great for education. With programs improving, there is always new things to do. Computers are constantly changing and becoming more advanced, providing things to do. @NUM1 computer owners say that the latest developments for computers give them useful tools for daily activities. They also provide people with jobs ranging from repairs to programming. Calendars promote organization and punctual timing. Computerized calculators provide quick access whenever the time should come. Even for a newspaper company like yours can benefit from this technology with virtual newspapers along with normal newspapers. In conclusion, computers are good for everyone because they are constantly developing, they help with essays and assignments, and there are many ways to extend your educational knowledge. After reading this essay I know that you will agree with me. ",10
1947,"I think that computers are the mores important things to use because they are more thing that you can do on computer. One day I was on the computer write a essay because it had to be typed. So I was in the microsoft word to typed my essay it was better then the notepad. In microsoft word there is a lot more to use for essays. The second reason why computers are better because you can go on the internet to play games, find animals, pictures, etc. The reason why I like computer is because I love to play game on andkon, miniclip, or kings. That is why computers are better then everything esle. The thired reason why I'm writing this is because to help other people to understand why computer are better. People should know that computer are better then phones ipods etc. That why people should started using computer in there house. In conclusion, computer are better then phones. I love to have a computer to learn more in life about other thing that I don't know yet.",6
1948,"Dear to who it @MONTH1 @CAPS1, A computer has become a way of life these days. Almost every household has a desktop computer and many individuals own laptops. Though everyone depends on a computers they are a waste of time. They @MONTH1 help people communicate and find information, but they are useless otherwise. Computers are a waste of time because they are full of useless websites that do not benefit anyone, they spread rumors and gossip that are completely irrelivent, and they distract people from their real lives. Computers are time wasters aside from a few things like research and email. First, computers are the machines in which someone @MONTH1 use to access the internet. Some will use the internet for business, or work. But most people will use the internet for useless sites like twitter, facebook, @CAPS2, or youtube. Though many will argue this statement those sites are completely irrelivant to a perons outside life and do nothing but waste peoples time on things that won't really make a difference in their life, unlike work. Second, so much pointless gossip has been spread throughtout the internet. Mostly these rumors pertain to pop-culture. Media rumors about celebrities are passed around and become the center of attention. These rumors an gossip do not benefit anyone. You @MONTH1 now know an embrassing fact about a celebrity but does not effect their future. Most rumors are forgotten within months which simply goes to show that it doesn't really matter or have a big effect on anyone in the end. Lastly, the internet can become a huge distraction to nes life. Different rumors, websites, and online games can steal ones attention to their life away. They start to focus on worthless media and don't realize whats important. People are tricked into thinking something like posting on facebook is important and must be part of their daily routine when it really is distracting them from what is important and what should been done daily. Computers, and internet especially, can take hours out of important things people could be doing in life. In conclusion, computers and the internet are a waste of time. Aside from work purposes, computers are a distraction to daily life. Computers offer pointless websites that take up time, spread pointless rumors and gossip, and overall distract people from their lives. Computers should not be banned or anything of the sort, but should simply be used for what is important.",10
1949,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 since the day it was invented, the computer has been regarded as a piece of technology that can help us. Over the years, companies and people have modified and improved computers to the point that they can fit in the palm of your hand. We rely on the computers and in return, they do our work efficiently. However, some people are concerned that computers could be bad for us. I'm not one of those people. After all, is there anything wrong with increasing hand-eye coordination, learn about whatever you want, and talk to anyone online all at the single click of your mouse? I used to get ot a @DATE1 camp, where I boarded at a college and took courses for three weeks. In this time, I met plenty of friends. As you can probably tell, by the end of the three weeks, I had to say goodbye-but not before collecting all of their @CAPS3 adresses! @CAPS2 friends came from all over the world. For example, @CAPS2 roommate came from @LOCATION1, and @CAPS2 classmate came all the way from @LOCATION2! Computers, in this case, became @CAPS2 means of communication. I could send all @CAPS2 friends an @CAPS3, and they would recieve it in less than a minute ( much faster, compared to ""snail mail"" which took a few days to receive. @CAPS2 computer allowed me to stay in touch with all of @CAPS2 friends, with-out the costly phone bills, or slow delivery time, @CAPS3 helps almost everybody-from the business people discussing urgent matters, all the way down to people like me, who are just trying to talk to their friends. However, emailing isn't the only good thing about computers! Have you @CAPS1 been assigned a school project on something rediculous that you don't know, like the element of @ORGANIZATION2, or how to build an engine? No matter what topic you're assigned, the internet will have an answer, or at least a theory. A big advantage of having a computer is the fact that there are expansive search engines, such as google or yahoo. Because the internet is unlimited, you can find your answer online, whether it's from the online scientific dictionary, or a nobel prize winner's bestselling book-which is very convenient. By doing so, you literally have access to all of the knowledge in the world. @PERCENT1 of people who use their computer have better hand-eye coordination than those who don't use a computer, according to a recent research experiment. Hand-eye coordination is an @CAPS4 part of our lives. Without it, we wouldn't be able to pick up something, or do most functions with our hand! From these statistics, it's clear that there's a strong positive correlation between using the computer and hand-eye coordination. After all, how else would @PERCENT1 @PERCENT1 of computer users have better hand-eye coordination than people who don't use computers. Because hand-eye coordination is such an important part of our daily routines, I'd say that it's safe to assume that computers benefit society, as well as ourselves. As you can probably tell, computers have improved our world in so many ways. With the invention of super-fast processing computers, we're able to do things even quicker than before. From gathering information, to improving hand-eye coordination, then to communication, I think that we should be able to agree that computers, @CAPS5 not @CAPS4 to the physical needs of the human race, are a wonderful invention that should be cherished, seeing as they greatly help and benefit our society, even up to today! *- @CAPS5 books @MONTH1 hold the same information, it's much easier to find it online rather than skim through a myriad of pages to get your answer.",11
1950,"To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I have recently heard about the use of computers and how they dont benefit society. I think that is wrong, computer benefit our society in many ways. Computer teach us hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places. Most importantly allows people to talk online with people all over the world. First, computers have always benefited our society by teaching us hand eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination helps everyone, people of all ages and for different reasons. It helps us better in sports such as a basketball, football, soccer and all other sports. We have perfected our aim and how to use it to benefit other things. Like if someone through a saccer ball at you, you would have hand-eye coordination and will be able to hit him or her back, im not saying you should do that but the computer has showed you hand-eye coordination. Also, computers have also helped us learn about far away places. Children all over the country have used a computer to help them learn about far away places for project and homework. Even adults as well have used the computer to search about far away places they want to go to. For example my parents have recently researched a place they want to go to for their anniversary, they planned on going to @LOCATION2. Anyways, all im saying is that all kinds of people use the computer to search or learn about far away places. Lastly, we all have used computers to talk to someone. Even if it was your grandmother, we all have done it, for different reasons to. If you didn't get the social studies homework go online and asle a friend, or even a teacher. Sometimes you just want to talk to someone but dont have their number, go online and see if their on. Not long ago I used the computer for this reason, I went online to see if I could find my great grandmother, and I did. I talk to her for hours, she lives in @LOCATION1 and is @NUM1 years old. But understand that any person and every person talks to someone online. In conclusion, the use of computers has benefited us and our society. It has taught us hand-eye coordination, gave us the ability to learn about far away places and also gives us the chance to talk to people online. I think the people who disagree should change their mind about that. Havent you used a computer, doesn't it help your life a lot?",9
1951,"Dear cheshire newspaper, @CAPS1 a poll of @NUM1 residents, of all ages, in the town of cheshire, @PERCENT3 said that computer overall benefit our society, more and more people are turning to computers now-a-days. But, not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I believe that computers do benefit society because they teach hand-eye cordination, you can talk to people from faraway places and you can learn new things from them. Firstly, computer involve using the mouse, keybourd and the screen. As an infant, all actions of your eyes on the screen, while you hands on the mouse or keyboard, need to work together in order to complete a simple task of clicking on a website. Due to recent study. @PERCENT4 of the function in your (eye function) and your (hand function) goes directly into the process of making things about. Just using the mouse and screen is great practice, and youth children. Mary @CAPS2 a mother from chesshire, says ""@CAPS3, I didn't allow my @NUM2 year old son the computer because i didn't want him to form any bad habbits. But, he was having trouble with his coordination. so i gave him some educational games in play on the computer for @NUM3 minuts per day and i can already see an improvement."" @CAPS4. Nemur from @ORGANIZATION3 university also that computers are a great way to teach tings that you can't find in a textbook. Do you want your child to talk. very simple quality to ? as you can see computers are great for society because they teach hand-eye coordination. Secondly, computers give you the ability to talk to people from faraway places. My sister @CAPS5 goes to college, and i don't get to see her, every week we and just chat. I would miss @CAPS5 more than i already do if i didn't have a computer, this is the lifestle of many men and women in way, who miss their family. @PERSON1 who lieves with her kids @CAPS6 and @PERSON2 exclaims, "" my husband has been stationed in @LOCATION1 for one years and and the only time I get to talk to him is on the computer. ""@CAPS7 the of three with family members in the war, imagin get a foll report from loved ones. In essense computer can bring a family together. Lastly You can learn new things from computer. A recent study from @ORGANIZATION2 shows that @PERCENT1 of students use the internet for information on projects, reports @PERCENT2 say that computer won't benefit the society? Most of the information today is not found in book. study from the university of shows that only @PERCENT5 of the information you gather is from reading. a bunch of people would call this unfortunate, but the kids those days are much smarter then kids in the @DATE1's. In addition mostly all buinesses are computer data and importan information. @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, all of our textbooks, assignments, and grades are now. The access i have helps me a ton overall computer have much information for our everyday lives. In conclusion, kids learn social techniques such as hand-eye cordination, computers allow you to get much with people around the world, and computers store many things. Which you use daily, You @MONTH1 say that computers do not benefit everyday living, but from the already presented I believe they do. computers are useful, reliable and easy to access, which make them a significant part of the human lifestyle. thank you for you time.",10
1952,"Computers who need them, Some say there just as bad as tv and I agree for multiple reason's first, your playing game that can be addictive and you cant sleep or eat. Nextly, @CAPS1 time website @MONTH1 have inaproperate lounge or pictures. Last but definatly not least lack of exercise and you can gain plenty of punds. Still think computers strenghen hand eye coordination and give people a chance to learn about far away place so can @CAPS2 and textbooks still dont think computers or bad let me elaberate. First thing first addictive game have a very large effect sometime when your booked on the game you would say ""wait please after I beat this level"" or ""I'll eat after I beat this game on the computer"", @CAPS3 not good to stay on the computer all the time and play play video games the whole time. Then there is impropreite websites with inapropriente langue and peictures a child @MONTH1 stumble on and I hardly dought you @MONTH1 want your kid using inapropriate! Saying and word's into very disgusting and inapropriate pictures while look for a website. Lastly on of biggest reason is the look of exercise that bad you can be wasting your time inside when you can go outside and exercise of interact with friend and family there is so much thing you can do instead of staying inside and you can loose the weight you gain while playing on the computer. In conclusion here what you can do you can go outside enjoy the fresh air and hang out with friends and family I'm not saying @CAPS3 is all bad you must limit the time to a minnimum there is ton's you can do so just do @CAPS3 @CAPS3 can be a good thing.",9
1953,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 do have on effect on people, because most people now go on the computer for everthing. A computer is a place where you can chat with your friends, And. just be online all the time without interact with people around you, @CAPS1 I think at this point most teens like to just sit on the computer all day and not have to worry about getting fresh are talking to others gany outside to enjoy the weather most and people just like staying on the computer all day and not worring about there family, And other friends. @CAPS1' to me I really think that computers do have affect not of peoples lives to make than just sit there and stay on the computer all day and chat but most people like gany on the computer because you can sit there and talk all day and not do nothing and not with people you. Most dont know this but it is not really good to have that affect on you because every time you would like to do something you want to leave away from the computer @CAPS1 to have that effect on you about your computer is not really good for you. Its a good thing that you can go online and talk to people but not on the line because people got that effect that makes than want to be on the computer all day. Than your body is not getting a lot of excersis and then that mess up your weight class than you start to become lazy and never want to do any thing, And not go places, @CAPS2 than you wouldnt be fit right and you would a person who lazy and who just work to sit home all the time and be on the computer. @CAPS1 most people who are on the computer most of the time. Should take some time out of being on the computer and give more time to excercising and staying fit and get out the house and enjoy and stop someting most time on the computer @CAPS1 the of this I hope I you and I hope you agree with me about people staying on the computer most of the time and not boring with things than besides on the computer.",8
1954,"Dear Newspaper, Have you ever wanted to learn about something but your knowledge is limited due to you only have books around you, well not with a computer. On a computer you can search anything you want to learn about in the world, communicate through a webcam with somebody thats on another continent, and a computer can be used for movies games and software. When i need to do a big school project i usally use a book a little bit, then i look for legit knowledge on the internet. I find that the possobilites are endless for reaserch on the internet also can be used for pictures or historical artifacts that you would want placed onto your project, or for you to just see a detailed picture on them. I also heard that @PERCENT1 of scientist have information that is of the internet. When my friend moved very far away we would still be able to see each other because we both had a webcam on our computer, so he was @NUM1 states away but i was able to still see him in a video chat. To me thats an amazing step in technology, I amseeing that is being used more frequently for science, lessons in school and etc. Society is defintitly benifiting off of computers. Whenever i get bored i like to hap on my computer and play a game, or watch movies or tv on the computer. There is also other things to do like use videographic softwares or use picture editing softwares.

1955,"Dear Local newspaper, I think computers are not making people lose exercise because you get exercise with every letter or word that you type and it is a great way to interacte with family, friends, and a way to meet new people. You can also watch and create you own interesting videos or maybe to get a job because you might be unemployed and need money to pay bills or you want to get car insurance. Their are so many things you can get online that you can't buy at stores. Like real wooden finger boards or tech of of flat face, cum or prowood, You can buy off of any finger board site you wanna buy off of it's fun and easy. If you miss something on the news you can go to and get news in you town when you want it a how you want it. You can use facebook or myspace to interact with you friends and family. You can book vacations or get aways online it any vacation website/hotel websites. You can find your unclaimed money at unclaimedmoneycity.com of money on I have fifty bucks on my how much do you have to find out are click away. If you wanna register you the go online it helps you with your hand-eye-cordination. The internet is can for people all.

You can take a with you when you away on a trip or go for a ride in your you can use a laptop basically anywhere you want even in bed or walking just don't drop it if you drop it you might break it then you would to buy a new one which cost a lot of money if you a laptop have money you can enter on you computer to win a laptop or any other thing you heard desires like an ipod touch or you own xbox maybe you can win free games such as skate @NUM1 or call of duty.",8
1956,"I think that computers are ok because they can be useful at times when it comes to research, location and chat. They can't be useful all the time because they there are pop-ups, and viriuses. Im not saying computers is a good thing or bad thing, it's just ok at sometimes. I think computers are ok because they use very useful. For example @PERSON2 need help finding his friends house but his mom told him to go on google earth or mapquest that helped him alot. Computers are pretty handy especially research but not that much websites are good and that's why you have to find specific information. Without computers, how can people talk to their friends from a far away distance like @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION2 and @CAPS1 or phones were built because of computers when it comes to chatting, emails, and now for game systems also. My @NUM1 reason why computers are @CAPS2.K. because they tick people off sometimes because they would crash or have pop-ups + viruses. For instance, @DATE1. @PERSON1 has to go to her friends but when she hut down her computer a big internet explores sign was her career and it took @PERCENT1 minutes to chat down so she had to get her hardrive fired. And staying on the computer, is not good either you have to take a break so it can @CAPS5 your bill problems or just hang out with your friends because communication is of teamwork and community. My last reason why I think computers are oil because of the @CAPS6 of @ORGANIZATION1 problems with computers and paper work. ""I am glad there was one man and all he did was create @ORGANIZATION1 which was the best selling computers in the country. I am also glad of his work when the computers stopped and they created @CAPS3 box and @CAPS3 box @NUM2. On the other hand like I said before that computers have problems that cause people to lase it. Tons of damaged computers were shown in @LOCATION1 for a program called ""@CAPS5 the Computers @CAPS6"" which tells people to @CAPS5 power to their computers and to get out of the house and have fun outside no matter where you go. Paperwork was used to sign contracts, assignments and documents. From @NUM3 to college senior years.

So just for all the parents out their, @CAPS1 is a special thing on a computer. This speciel thing can be found in the settings on your computer it ceeps count of how long your kids are on for. If you put a serten time on it, it will turn your computer off on the time you settel. And you need password to get back on so remember the password you selected. So I think if we tell parents these serten things kids will be more healthy and will still get time to go on their computers. So computers are nether good or bad it just depends on how you use them. So try to use them the right way. Just to talk to friends for a little and to do your home work or just to learn something new everyday. So local newspaper please help get the word out and help all people to get more fit and healthy. Thank you.",7
1958,"Dear Local Newspaper, Technology has deffinitly become a part of society @CAPS1 a days everyone's always on their phones, or iPods. Most people have thought that technology is a good thing, but @CAPS2's affecting us because we spend hours on end sitting at the computer. Other think that technology's there for a reason so to use @CAPS2 as much as you want as long as your happy with @CAPS2. I happen to be one of those people that think that too, if I enjoy then I should use @CAPS2. Computers are one of the most common technology known right @CAPS1. I feel that a computer is great because with typing a few words and clicking on some buttons you have the world at your fingertips @CAPS2 makes finding information so much easier, you can find out anything you want, whenever you want without having to go through much difficulty. @CAPS2 doesn't only give you one answer to your question but millions of answers that fit exactly what your looking for. Computers also allow easy comunication, @CAPS3 in the day people would send letters and recieve them in a week, but the internet is international so you can send on e-mail or instant message and recieve @CAPS2 in just a few seconds other people prefer to talk on the phone which is fine too but @CAPS1, as technology is getting more advance you can webchat and see the person as you talk to them, wouldn't that be much better then just hearing and speaking to a relative across the country or a friend in a different country I know I enjoy @CAPS2, almost every week while I webchat with my grandma in @LOCATION1. Computers just get better and better, @CAPS1 a days you can even shop online, for @CAPS4, shoes,accesories anything really @CAPS5't you hate walking around a store for hours, and they @CAPS5't even have your size? I know I do especially with my mom But @CAPS1 you can buy @CAPS4 or anything else you'd like from the comfort of your computer chair and no more waiting in line for hours. Even though people say that computers and technology are bad for society, I disagree and feel that we should be able to use computers as long as we have moderation, because @CAPS2 really is a wonderful thing and we should be thankful for @CAPS2.",9
1959,"Dear People of @ORGANIZATION2 many computers do you have in you household? I'll admit myself that we have in mine, one for each person. However, I feel, that this technology has had a negative affect on people, despite its benefits to society is a whole at several personal risks, no matter @ORGANIZATION2 safe they think they are. The time spent staring at a desktop is the time you are take away from your own heath, and possible your lifetime. Yes, there are ways to communicate with person on a computer, but this process seperates people from their families, and teaches kids to live in a typed world, so they don't know @ORGANIZATION2 to act face to face. Then there are those people who use computers or any such technology to harm someone. Why would you give the real world for such chances? I have @NUM1 questions for you. @ORGANIZATION2 much time in one day do you spend on your computer and have you ever noticed the correlation between that amount of time and your pant size? A study done by a group at the @ORGANIZATION1 found that for every hour spent on a computer you gaini another half of a. Crazy, right? But this happens because you aren't execising or even just walking during this time, This also accurs because as you sit, there, your body's healthy doing anything, as it slows down your digestive systems. Another way that affects health is that is almost encourages unhealthy habits smoking. @PERCENT1of people who fail at an attempt to quit smoking spend an average of @NUM2 hours per day on a computer. This because your mind isn't, so i'ts free, to give in to small impulses and desires. We all know such unhealthy habit to bad to and eventually . When you ask your child what they do with their friends, you ever locking for the answer. We t'll a lot? No, because you know that the way someone sounds in a writter, phoned message, isn't always @ORGANIZATION2 they are in real life. If you have difficulting talking to or liking a person when you see them face to face, then your relationship with them isn't real. An all can lie to you or be cruel because the person on the other end forgets you are real. Computers are a way for kids to spend all their time on a false relationship. Two polls were taken by the same @NUM3 people. One asked if you had a good, or bad relationship with your family. The other asked @ORGANIZATION2 many hours you spend on a computer. The majority of @PERCENT2 people said the devote @NUM1 1/@NUM1 hours to their computers but that same majority also said they have bad relationships with their family members. It doesn't take much to understand @ORGANIZATION2 this happens. Not only is the time separating a family, but as a person gets more addicted to their computer they become more wrapped up in their own, non existent world. Being online can be very dangerous, because there are people out there who want to hurt you, or are just plain bothering you. A few years ago, a teenage girl had a friend she completely truisted that she @CAPS1 often. They planned to meet at a mall. The same girl was found dead in that mall. As you maight have gathered, communications online can be dangerous, and very unsafe. Any one can have access to you and some people will contiunue to pester you wheneven you go online.",10
1960,"Dear local newspaper, I think that the effects of computers have more of a positive impact rather than a negative one. Computers are great for many reasons and it would be exrenley difficult to do things without these pieces of technology. Computers have positive @CAPS1 because you can chat online with your friends see what is going on in the world, and check email and important events. Chatting online with friends can be a very good thing with thing like chat you can talk to friends plan out things like when you want another about online chatting is facebook on facebook you can also talk to friends but something great about facebook is you can reconnect with old friends that might have moved or gone to a new school. But its not just great for kids. It can be good for adults too! Adults can reconnect with old friends from high school and college and much more. Computers are also great because you can see whats going on in the world. You can do that on @CAPS2.V. to right? that's probably your question but can you check it as quiclky as you went to? or computers. You can. You dont have to watch tall of the news you can just go online and see what is more interesting to you. Checking this on the computer is very important. email updates are this. People can set updates on checks is big too. For example childrens sports are posted online and you can check there. How would you know when you have a sporty, news alot of other events without it? In conclusion I have stated my opinions on why computers have a positive impact. I think we need them u although they are have a. Positive impact because you can chat online, see word news, and check things.",8
1961,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 more and more people use computes but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Owning a computer could be a good thing but becomes an unhealthy habit. I believe people spend too much time on computers. People need to get more exercise go outside with friends and family and enchance your learning. If we could get how people think about computer time, it will be a whole new ball game. To start off with families need to get more exercise. Our country is becoming the ""fattest country in the wourld."" personally I think that is the worst nickname for the @ORGANIZATION1. Don't you think so too? Our country needs to get off @ORGANIZATION1 our couches and get off @ORGANIZATION1 being behind a computer screen all day long. Having a computer only makes you lazier. "" @CAPS2 can you go take out the trash"" ""@CAPS3 on @CAPS4, I just started to talk to them!"" @CAPS5't this sound familier? Scientists show after this scene, most likely @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 our country stastys on the computer for another hour. Our country needs to get more exercise. In addition, we really need to go outside more. We should appreciate the outdoors. Instead @ORGANIZATION1 sitting in front @ORGANIZATION1 the computer, go outside and play a game with friends, family or a neighbor. There are so many healthy activities you can do outside. Just imagine a warn, @DATE1 day, playing wiffle doll in your yard with your neighbor hood. Maybe not to you, but to me that sounds great compared to sitting inside, in front @ORGANIZATION1 a computer screen. You should really think about how much better being in the great outdoors than playing inside on a computer is. Lastly, people really need to enhance their learning. Sure, you can find facts on the internet, but whatever happened to reading a good book. Sitting on a couch, eating potato chips is certainly not better than readin a suspensful book in the nice @DATE1 breeze. You can read anywhere you want! I know I would much rather read a book thatn "" surf the web"" for hours. In conclusion, these machines are becoming too addictive to our society. We need to stop this before computers swallow our world. People need to get more exercise, go outside and enhance their learning the healthy and proper way. Our society needs to step up and explain how much better it is with less time on the computer.",10
1962,"Dear @CAPS1, I think that people are spending too much on the computers. I think this because some of my friends now can stay on the computer all day and not go anywhere, also when you stay on the computers you won't be out side and not useing their energy and I read magazines and some stistics say that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 that use computers all the time become oubeast. My first reason why I think people are spending too much time on the computer is, now when I am on the computer people are on all day every day they don't go anywhere they just sit at their computer and just talk to other people. My second reason why I think people spend too much time on the computers is when people are on computers they are not out side when they are on the computer eating a bunch of food they are not out side where they can be exercising and be fit. My third reason why I think people spend to much time on computers is; about a week ago I was reading a magazine and some satistics said that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 that use computers most of their time become oubeast because that's all the time. Now I hope you can see why I think people spend too much time on the computers.",7
1963,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 imagining our entire society with no computers. People would be helping the environment and exercising. We would have so many less obese people. Not only that, but hundreds of people have gotten in trouble iver the internet. On facebook and many other sites why would anyone ever want to rsik going to jail? If we don't have computers then these bad thing wouldn't happen, computers are going to always have negative effects an everyone. Today in our economy and environment things aren't doing so well. Forest are being overturend into malls and other shopping centers, oceans polluted by disgusting, black oil. Many people can be worried about it, but wont do anything because the're inside or their computers. They could be helping save the @NUM1 forrests that are being destroyed every year. Insted they decide to go on facebook, myspace, and twiter. If we had more people outdoors working towards a better environment, then I doubt there would be as many issues as there are in the world today. Not only can being outdoors help the environment, if people werent on computers then they would probably be exercising. In the @ORGANIZATION1 @PERCENT1 of the population are obese, This is not right, people shouldn't be sitting on their computers for hours on end. I undestand how this can be hard for some when it come to working on computers for your job. Although isn't your personal health just as importan? Computers can start to get addicting for millions of people so it is important to get over that and do some exercising for a change. Everyone could be so much healthier if they just got off the computer and went for a run. I have heard about so many horrible cases where people have hurt themselves because of what people said to them over the computer. Even though they can have no idea who they're talking to, they would take your own life. This is horrible and has to stop now, people should not be getting hurt over the internet. it is scary to know that there are people out there who would do this. If nobody had computers then lives would be saved and you would have better self esteems. My friend @PERSON1 agrees ""when people are cyber bullying. it takes the fun out of computers and starts to scare me'"" computers are making people and worried. It is obvious that computers have very negative effects all kids and adults. I honeslty believe we should not have computers, without them we could learn to be less obese, and help our world's environment. We would have less incidents of bullying over the internet. Computers have a horrible down-side and end up effecting us all in a worse way than we imagined.",10
1964,"Did you know that computers have gotten us to move a head to life. I believe that computers benefit to society. I believe that computers allow us to communicate to one another, it can create @LOCATION1 cures and @LOCATION1 technolgy, and we can learn more about the world and society. First computers are a good way to stay intouch with your friends and family or even got to met someone @LOCATION1. From dateing serveses that matches you up to someone you might want to spend to rest of your life with to face book which is were you can chat with friend and family members now you can even video chat. For example this is a great way to comupate and talk to your friends. I go to camp in main and I live far away from all of my friends so the way that I keep in contact with them, is through the computer. Next, the computer is not just for comunication but it can also help invet @LOCATION1 tecnal things. For example if you wanted to build ky @LOCATION1 you could first build it on the computer and get a full view of what it would look like before building it. I watched this show about @PERSON1 and it was saying how they could build a modle of a bike on the computer and find out every they to know before building it in real not pay a single. Also @PERSON2 from the @ORGANIZATION1 stated ""for and we have done everything on the computer"" @CAPS1, computers can catch you up with the latest storys that happend all around the world in a matter of seconds rather then waiting the next day for the news paper to find out the same information that you did right wen it happend because of the computer. One time my friend was traveling out of the country so she didnt have a @CAPS2.V. but she brought her computer and she could watch the news and she could find out anything she wanted to like weather on her computer. Therefore, the computer can keep you informed in everything that you want to know out you just have to be and be careful what you say. Once again computer can help you gey inform in what is going on around the world. It allows you to communicate to family and friends, and it helps us and move on without technology and find cures to help everyone.",9
1965,"The increasing use of computers to some people @MONTH1 seem like a bad thing but it isn't. In my opinion the advancement in technology can help people because it can help us with bussinesses to make less mistakes in the future. Also, computers are used for research on many things from places to medical issue. In the world of bussiness a computer can be very helpful when it comes to taxes. For example, each year you have to find the total amount you spent on taxes. Many people keep track of this by using a grid or calender of the year. A grid or @CAPS1 on a computer wouldn't take as long to fill out or find mistakes. In designing a buiding you have to draw each room and the demensions of the room. A computer and program will help you fit the peices together so that you building, will have all the right angles and spacing. Finally, in a job where you have to communicate with people from all over the world you might need to share information quickly. For example, a company can have more than one location around the world so if it is found that in the @LOCATION1 a product is failing to work they need to contact everyone immediatly. Not only in buissiness is this helpful but in research for people. Starting very young in life @CAPS3 do research on various topics. In school @CAPS3 do research on places, events, animals and more for projects. This year @CAPS3 dd a project on the @CAPS2 and had to do research from online. Nearly all that @CAPS3 learned to complete this project was found online. By completing this project and using the computers @CAPS3 learned about a topic none of us would have chose to. But for projects and learning isn't the only thing that can be found online, @CAPS3 plan vacations and parties all the time. First @CAPS3 learn about the place and then @CAPS3 contact people to be there and how to get there all by comuter. @CAPS3 also use computers for medical research. Scientists use information posted by others to learn how treatment react with people or chemical interactions. By computer you can also learn different tests used to find the problem with people. or how things should look if they work properly. Finally you can research disease and how people are affected by it. For example, in health class @CAPS3 researched lung disease; how it happens and what it does to body. In knowing this i can prevent myself from experiencing it. Computers can benefit society in many ways because the help us in our bussiness life or everyday life. No matter our age. @CAPS3 will need to research many things to learn and grow as people.",9
1966,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, A computer is a high tech, knowledge full devise that is like a huge encyclopedia but easier to use and quicker! @CAPS3 is also a scoial network and helps make new friends in the comfort of your home. You can do almost anything on computers now, find out how people live aorund the world or even just webcam with one of your friends. A huge advantage to computers is world wide web (www.) @CAPS3 can take you anywhere from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1. World wide web is like a social highway @CAPS3 cconnects everyone in the world and teaches people how others live. Also with world wide web you can meet anyone through a chat or even a webcam call. Talk about a lot of friends! Some @MONTH1 say the internet is taking away time from family friends and education. I think the complets oppisite! To me the internet is creating so many new opportunitys to reconnect with old friends and make new friends. Also I talk to my friends much more through webcam and chat messaging. When @CAPS3 comes to family we all know that they are a pain to be ground sometimes! So instead of sleeping your cousins where you @MONTH1 get in a fight and even want to go home you can just talk to them for a little while through chat so you can leave the conversation whenever you want! Another great thing about the internet is school! Now some books are online and you don't have to even luggace them home like you used to! Research for projects is also so much easier all you have to do is go on a google and type @CAPS3 in instead of going through tons and tons of books @CAPS3 will take you only one click! Not only are high schools and middle schools using computers for schooling, some colleges even after courses at home on the computer! Nowadays laptops are required fro some schools and a great way to learn new knowledge. Overall computers are a great invention that are very much needed in our society not only do they reach they connect people and also are so much fun! Thats why computers are a great thing to have.",9
1967,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I strongly believe that computers have a positive affect on people. Computers help teach important skills like hand-eye coordination, let people talk and interact with their friends and anyone can reaserch about history or facts on a sertain subject. I urge to you that computers do benifit society. What would you do everyday without a computer? @CAPS4 is a fact that @PERCENT1 of the world has a computer in their very own homes. I know that I use my computer every day. One of the most important things I use @CAPS4 for is school. Some childrens handwriting is so messy that not even their teacher can read @CAPS4 by when you are able to tye a @NUM1 page essay on @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you are not able to be neat but @CAPS4 saves time to. For example, @CAPS3 you are not sure how to spell a @CAPS2, you don't have to waste time looking @CAPS4 up in the dictionary, you can use spell check right or your. Also @CAPS3 you find mistakes while researching instead of earasing which is very messy you can highlight what is wrong and backspace @CAPS4. Computers are not just good for school but all of this helps you learn skills like hand eye coordination for when you are older and working! I can remember when I was a horrible typer, and @CAPS4 would take long type one paragraph. But now I speed! I beg you computers help our society! Computers do not only but @CAPS4 is very easy with technology like or @CAPS5 let you talk and about friends likes you to tell the way world! @CAPS3 you friend you dont have and sent @CAPS4 all the way through the mail taking your email is from you have a computer! this new technology people have been able to meet new friends that they never knew were right in their schools! Also with @ORGANIZATION3 you can not only email or @CAPS6 your friend but talk to them live and be able to see their face! I do acnoladge that yong chidren can suntimes use the internet to make fun of or other people but as long as you stay out of the drama @CAPS4 is great to use! I advise you that computers benifit everyone! @CAPS4 is true that every one learns somthing new everyday. Well computers with websights like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS7.con or @CAPS8 allow anyone at anytime, look up anything! For example @CAPS3 you have a essay due the next day with no time to go to the library you are able to search the topic and gather the facts in a given amount of time. Many student and teachers rely on computers for this and without @CAPS4 they could get behind or confused. Computers arn't just good for researching for school but what @CAPS3 you were alergic to gluten? you could go online and not only search for good and what foods you can an a cannot eat but places where you can shop for the food too! In my opinion I strongly thing computer do help our society. Computers are helpful in many ways and they benifit us. You can learn skills, talk to friends and reaserch! I hope you agree because computers really make our society a better place.",10
1968,"I think that computers benefit society. I think this because they give people the oppurtunity to improve hand eye coordination gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. First, one way computers benefit society is that they improve hand eye coordination. This is possible because when you use the computer you can't watch your wouldn't see what happening on the screen. Also the reason it benefits society is that you are now able to do a variety of things such as cook more, catch a ball, and drive a car. These all involve good hand-eye coordination and could lead to job oppurtunities like an athlete, cook, or driver, and obviously a computer tech. Furthermore, one way computers benefit society by teach hand-eye coordination. Next, a why computers benefit society is by giving the ability to learn about this is because the internet allows you to learn many things. Learning about faraway places would benefit society because people. Being open to change and can lead us to a better country and world. The other way learning about faraway places helps us that you learn about different cultures. This also helps because you can learn different. Learning these techniques can spice up your and lead to a buisness. Furthermore, benefits society. Last a way a computers benefit society is they allow people to talk to others online. This is very helpful because you @MONTH1 have a relative who lives far away but you dont have enough money and they, to visit. You can still talk online and not lose touch. Another way talking online helps is it brings people closer together. This is possible because someone you are friends with, but got in a fight or argument with, can talk to you face to face without any tension from being right there. This helps bring them closer by talking it out. Furthermore, talking to people on the internet or online benefits society by being able to talk face to face without being there. Finally, computers benefit society by teaching hand-eye coordination, allowing people to learn about faraway places and people, and letting people talk online. Just think what the world would be like and without them.",9
1969,"Dear Newspaper, Computers have become a very large part of the world today, but the debate over if they have a positive or negative effect on people is ongoing. Computers have a negative effect on people. People use online social networking websites to reaplace real, human interaction. Also, people become addicted to their computer, and lose exercise by idly sitting at the computer. Computers do all the work for people such as finding words in passages so the people don't have to read, too. Computers definitely have a negative effect on people today. Websites such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and twitter have replaced face to face human interaction. People have lost natural social instincts. For example, when @NUM1 year old college student and @CAPS1 fan was asked how long a day she spends on @CAPS1 'connecting' with people compared to interacting with people face to face she said ""I spend about @NUM2 hours a night on @CAPS1 chatting and talking to my 'friends' and on average I'll see my friends in person about once every two weeks."" This college student has developed unhealthy habits and almost elimated all social, real interactions from her life. Now when she is in social situations, she feels akward and does not know what to say or how to act. Online interaction is having a negative effect on people. The more time that people spend on computers, the less time they will spend exercising. The less that people exercise, the more obese they will become. In a recent study of @CAPS4 families, an average on a week, night the family spent about @NUM3 times as much time on the computer! than they did exercising. When people should be exercising, they are going on the computer instead because it is less stressful and easily accessible. Computers are leading to an unhealthy world. Not only do people not use their muscles as much because of computers, but they also don't use their brains. @NUM4 out of every @NUM5 adults who own computers cannot even do long division because there is a calculator on the computer which can take the place of all math done out by hand or working through the problem in your head to find the answer. You then don't need to use any brain power of smarts to succeed in math. Furthermore, math becomes typing in numbers and pressing buttons. Also, if there is a full page of writing, you would not have to read the page because there is a 'find' button on the computer where you just type the word or phrase that you want it to and then in an instant you have found your answer without using any intelligence. Computers do all of the work for people and are making people stupid. Computers have a negative effect on people. They discourage real human interactions. they make people go on the computer more than they exercise and they are dulling people's intelligence. The more people that have computers, the worse the effect. Computers are a bad thing for humans.",10
1970,"Dear newspaper, Computers do benefit socity because they help the community. It does have a positive effect on people of all ages. For more older people who don't really know how to work a computer, they can take classes. They can learn how to write on the computer. Play games, go on the internet etc. For more younger kids they can play educational games. Like a @CAPS1 game or a grammer game. Many people @DATE1 go on their computer to learn about far away places such as @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION1. They learn all about there culture and traditions. Its much better on the internet than having to buy tickets and going on the flight. You can talk to people online. Mostly teenagers do it, but some more older people do it to. They have e-mails, aim, facebook and text messaging. There are many positive effects for people who have computers. They lengthen their vocabulary, chat with friends learn about the world etc. To make a long story short, computers do have a positive effect on people. ",7
1971,"@PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 have computors. Is it good or bad for people to use computors? I do believe that computors benifit society. Computors are benefitial in society because computors teach hand eye coordination, give people chance to learn about far away places and allows people to talk to people they might not be able to see often. Computors teach hand eye coordination. Using the keyboard helps kids not rely on sight but on memory. If children learn to this out of memory then they might learn how to do other things like dribbling a basket ball or kicking a soccer ball with out looking at the ball. On a computor they have fast paste video games that make people better at using there hands. Unlike playing sports there is no chance of getting hurt playing video games to make you alert. Hand eye coordination helps children be successful in life says my doctor. Sure you can learn hand eye coordination in other ways but non or as easy as on the computor. Being on a computor can teach you about far away places in an inexpensive way. If you are studing places in geography that look interesting and you want to see more of that place you can look it up on the internet. On the internet you would probably be able to find thousands of websites with information on the topic. This is benifical because it gives you background knowlegde on the subject. There are many amazing places or objects you would like to go to but you cannot because it is too expensive. On a computor you are able to see these places without having to travel. Sure you could just look these places up in books but this takes too much time. You are able to talk to friends and family online. If one of your friend have moved to a far away place you will still be able to communicat with them. You don't want to loose a freind because of lack of communication do you? If you live in @LOCATION1 and one of your family members live in another country like @LOCATION2 you will not go all the way to @LOCATION2 if you want to see how they are doing if you could just do it on line talking to them online is like being in the same room with them. In conclusion, I believe that computors are benefical in society. Computors allow you to learn hand eye cooridination, learn about far away places, and communitcate with freinds and family. Its now or never do you believe that computors are benifical to society or not. Computors can be benifical to communty. Are they or are they not you deside.""",9
1972,"Dear newspaper reporters, I think that we should keep computers. They're good for people to do their homework, research for a project their doing in school, and you need them if you have an iPod or anything like that to charge and put stuff on them. Some people say that kids are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising, but I think the good things overule them. Sometimes you might need a computer to do research for homework or an inclass project. Or maybe some students like to type their work on the computer. That might be better for some students who don't have good handwriting, like me, which is why I'm doing this @CAPS1 on the computer right now. I think more than @PERCENT1 of people will agree after they read this. If you have a portable electronic device that requires a computer, to charge it or put things like music, videos, pictures, apps., etc, how will you do that? I have a @CAPS2 player, and it needs a computer. I can't charge it or put music on it without one. Also, I think at least @PERCENT1 of people with jobs need a computer. My dad's job is to work with computers, so he can't not have one either. If he didn't, I don't know what his work would be doing. In conclusion, I think we should keep computers for the benefiting reasons. If you have a problem with your kids, set a time limit on how long they can be on the computer, and then say they have to exercise. Please take my suggestion!",8
1973,"Do computers keep people from enjoying the outside world? I think that computers take up peoples time and don't allow them to go outside. The first reason is people spend too much time on computers and get loss exercise. The second reason is computers don't allow you to enjoy nature. Finally computers keep you from interacting with family and friends. Without a doubt computers keep people from enjoying the outside world. People spend too much time on computers and get less exercise. If people eat junk food and other non nutrious food and go on the computer and no exercise it could cause them to gain weight. If people gain to much weight and still go on the computer, at same they will become obese. Exercise is great to maintain yourself fit and active and allows you to use and move your body. While on the computer you only use your hands which is not exercise. People spend of there time on computers and less enjoying nature. It is really wonderful to walk in beach or go for a walk at the park and leting the wind blow across your face instead of siting on a seat glancing at your computer. People have better times go out, breathing fresh, leting the sun touch their skin but on the other hand people look at pictures on nature on their computer which most be really dull. It is better to experience stuff in real life than on your computer screen. No doubt it is better to enjoy nature in real life. It is really for to interact with family and friends than chating online. You get to go on family food trip amusement parks which is a so much cooler experience than chating with friends. You can have play with friends and actually do correcting instead of typing on your keyboard. Interacting with your family and friends is active, fun and could be adventurous computer. No question interacting with family and friends is better than being on your computer. As you can see going out and having fun is better than being on the computer. The first reason is you exercise and go less time on your computer. The second reason is you enjoy nature. The final reason is you interact with friends. The real world is better than the world that is in your computer.",9
1974,"In my opinion computers benefit the society very much. They can have a very positive effect on all of the people who use a computer. For instance computers can teach you about far away places and people that you might never get to see or know about otherwise. You can also meet a whole bunch of new people online. You can make new friends or even find someone to spend the cool of your life with. Computers also have a program you can type your papers and have them checked. @PERCENT1 of all college students say that typeing in much faster and easier to do than writing. Wouldn't you went to be able to write papers much faster, and have than instantly ? Computers can teach you many things, exspecially about different places around the world. If you wanted to know what the capitol of brazil was then you could just the computer and look it up, easy. It would be much slower if you had to drive to the library, look it up then go work have. The would be wasting gas too, which is very expensive right than. there is so much on the computer that you could find anything. Say you would in know with a deep like, just computer and look it up. one time I . So I went to the computer and typed along with the music video and to the thing. I had found all . Computers meeting . you can @NUM1 out of online. That is a lot of people. You can also meet people you just want to be friends. With online, say like a . Instead of which , exspecially a across the ocean, you can use email. Email is also almost instant. You can have more conversations and become faster friends than just through letters. If you have to write papers for college or work, it is much faster and easier to type it! Many college students have laptops they around with then to type notes and do homework @PERCENT2 of college students say that it is easier to type notes and homework. They say this because if they make a mistake, the computer will automatically fix it. So they can just type without having to go back and fix mistakes themselves. With a computer you can also project what is on it to a big acreen. That way you don't have to wrote a whole of paper copies. Don't you want do less paper do save tress? All of these reasons benefit the do a great . Using a computer helps you learn about new places and people, meet new peopl, and write need, planted or school. So computers are a great benefit to our society and will continue to be even better.",9
1975,"Dear @CAPS1. T @CAPS2, @CAPS3 you know im writing to you about the effect computers have on people. I would agree that computers do benefit society because it allows us to learn anything we want to learn. Computers also help kids in school when they need research of a specific topic. My first reason on how computers benefit society is it helps us kids & teens have information on anything in the world. In fact just @DATE1 the computer helped me in my research for black history and found that very useful. Besides research it has practically everything you need to know from A-@CAPS4. The next reason why computers benefit society is by letting us communicate with other people around the world by using special websites like a skype or @CAPS5. When we can talk to people around the world you could be tought a new language or learning about another foreign culture. Our computer also help people paybills and do takes online and saving time rather than doing it by hand because they have or her block. Third I can see how the computer is bad for you but thats why they have games like dance dance revolution or rockland because a study has been taken that playing rockland you can burn @NUM1 calories for playing @NUM2 mins which way most sound like alot so imagine playing for @NUM3 mins, you could burn up to @NUM4 calories which is equivalent to eating a @NUM5 calories pack. Finally, just get on a computer and see how much fun it is to use wheather your playing a game or talking to other people online or researching a project or question. The computer can benefit you!",8
1976,"Dear newspaper editor, I believe that computers do benefit because the increase our knowledge, computers also help in socializing because write to them and they help till time. The first reason that computers helps us is by letting us about learn about topics that would've been otherwise unknown, for example, you can learn about distant countries and locations.  Imanige, not knowing what's out your state, or even your distant. That path would be cruel. The most important knowledge the computer gives us is the knowledge about business and stocks which in were changing unvichles are would never know. Knowing business helps later because the knowledge will get you a job  is your source pf money The money, like everyone knows will increase the quality of life. Another good reason, which helps the the computer helps with people @CAPS1 you world where without seeing them in person? As With the computer, you can keep by Which and hand speed as well as objects. Hence @PERSON1, computer and all of technology s not a badthing and is a good progression.",6
1977,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you like to keep in touch with your family and see how their doing or @CAPS1 yo be fine that you will never be in contalk with them? Yes I do agree that computers benefits society because computers help students learn more faster and easier, computers will help you keep in toch with your family, and their cheap. Computers will help students learn more faster ans easier in nschool and aven at home. For @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1 middle school students are doing this daily @CAPS4 proname it's called @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Im takeing this proname too, we @CAPS1 go down to the computer lab on @DATE1, and @DATE2. Know ill really bad at @CAPS4 it takes one weeks to learn something so im thinking cool we get use computers every student in the school lone computers. The prgrane teaches everything about @CAPS4. Frist teaches your times table chart witer I hate! When I get on the computers I allready learned ny @NUM1 times table it was so @CAPS3 I memroized every fact and it was really fun and @CAPS3. The computers help students learn @CAPS3! Its easier for them because you know how class and a teacher's walks by you and looks aven well kids think their doing something wrong and when your have this class clear then we @CAPS1 love to stop the and we to all himto settle above. Well thats wasting time for students this computers helps us! Also the great scientis @PERSON1 her did on expirment on coumputers to see if they help students learn more and esier to asked half the school @MONEY1 @CAPS5 to learn about or re goverment by text and the other half to learn about it an computers. The data shows that only @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 student learn from.Know if computers the other half @MONEY1 student learn form computers the percentage will increase! Computers keep in touch with your family. For @CAPS2. @MONEY1 @MONEY1 @MONEY1 people all around use computer's to keep in touch with their family member's. Computers help keep in touch abd in case a family member is in trouble their family could com and help. If there wernt computer's then people @CAPS1 be mesiarble I know I @CAPS1 be not knowing if your family members are safe is very hard. How @CAPS1 you feel if you couldnt keep in toch with your family? this @MONEY1 @MONEY1 people being happy will drope. In addition to this I read a @CAPS7 about a kid who was living with his aunt and where in the @CAPS8.S and his mom was in @LOCATION2 molding. His aunt and where didnt have a computer so how was he suppose to keep in toch? well they didnt the was so sach he gone crazy and sick that he died! computers help us stay with are family. Computers are very cheap know a days and could help the econmie. For @CAPS2 computer's are @NUM2 @NUM3 a day's so a lot @MONEY1 people are buying them this is bringing money into the econmie. The money can help pay for the army, built shelter's, and it can help are town get better. Also, are @CAPS10 @PERSON2 said ""having computer will make you succeful, and save you mony!""",10
1978,"Dear Local news, @CAPS1 people are addicted to the computer. Did you know that about @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 and adults are addicted to the computer? Acording to @PERSON1, a professer for @NUM1 years says, ""@CAPS2 we did the studies about computers we were noticing that the amount of @CAPS3 and adults using the computer was a huge amount of population"". As you noticed, using the computer is very common especially if you have one at home you get addicted. One you touch the mouse, you wouldn't want to get off. If you go on the computer and you have things to do the next day, trust me you won't have time, to do what you have to do. It's like the computer you down and not letting you go. And instead of you not paing attention its feed in. A formal amistad academy student named @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 reports to us ""I have a serious problem, once I get home at @TIME1 I go streight to the computer. I stay there from @TIME1@NUM2 a.m. I don't get much sleep and I don't do my homework because im addicted to the computer."" @CAPS3 can get exausted but they don't care they still go on no matter what time. Since we heard the student @ORGANIZATION1. She brought me to my next point about homework. If @CAPS3 don't react fast they will have bad grades in school. Acording to @CAPS4 songs, a principal for @NUM3 years announces that @NUM4 of @CAPS3 don't do their homeworke because they are into the computer. The world is not recognizing what the computer is doing to their young adults and how it's inpacting on them. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 don't go outside, spend time with their families, or friends just to be on the computer. @NUM5 of @CAPS3 all over the world decide to spend time at home in the internet then to join their families to an important place or just to be with them. We might be young but we only live once and we have to make the best of it and not stay on the computer. So this question is for you to think about! Its now or never, are you going to quit or feed into it? Are you going to be one of the @NUM6 people to be addicted acording to the widsome technology program's data? Think about your actions because at the end your choice just impact you and your behaviors.",9
1979,"Computers do have a good benefit on our society. I know this because computers teach, computers make things easier, and they are not a big impact on most lives. These things make computer a good thing to have in the world. Every kid at some point or another in their school experience will learn to type. typing is a ciriculum in most schools. Without computers this would not be possible. Computers also teach people about places they have never been and @MONTH1 never go. If you live in the country and didn't have a computer, you @MONTH1 never know what kind of world in outside your small farm. Last, computers teach social skills and about different people. Most kids have @CAPS1 and talk to each other every night, being social. People with different cultures are all over the internet for people to learn about. Computers teach things that some schools can't by themselves. Computers make humans lives easier because of what they are of. Have you ever been to a library without an @ORGANIZATION1 system? I haven't, but @CAPS2 would be hard to find the book you're looking for without that computer. In school we learn how kids in the old times always wrote on chalk boards. When I go to write an essay I want to type it and not write it out(especially). Typeing it also makes the essay easier for the teacher to read. Some kids have. Last, my mom works from home and she relys on her laptop to get work done. laptops make things easier for working can work home. Laptops are good in our society because they make things easier. I don't think that computers have a huge bad impact on peoples lives. How many adults have you seen playing away from on the computer. Many adults get up and get fresh air whenever they can. Computers a huge impact on kids because their parents watch them closely. Every one while you will a parent kid play on the computer. parents how much time. Last, computer are not the only electronic in the world. There are @CAPS3's, @CAPS4, play stations, and many more. So, computers aren't the only electronic causing problem. on that note, computer don't have a huge bad impact on people. In conclusion, computer have a good benifit in our society. They teach 'us, make everyday things easier, and don't have a huge bad effect on society. So, we should stop blaming computers for the reasons why less people can going outside and getting exercise.",9
1980,"Computers are amazing pieces of technology. We as the human race have come so far to develop this fantastic machine. Some people think that they do not benefit society and I am not one of those people. I believe computers can help you in so many ways hand-eye coordination on giving students a way to learn about almost anything even having the ability to chat online can help you. Sure, playing catch with dad can teach you hand-eye coordination but so can computers. The benefit to using a computer over catch is that you are constanly your skills no matter what you decide. You could be playing a game, chatting with a friend or even typing one and you still be moving had-eye coordination. One friend of mine with a disebility began to use the computer ar a very young age. By the time she was out of @NUM1 grade her parents said that ger hand-eye coordination had improve dramatically because of her use of the computer ther had at home. I never thought that using a computer could help somebody about much somebody asked, ""@CAPS1 isnt it better to go outsick play and catch instead of being lazy and using the computer all day?"" I do agree with that, but I think using computers are benificial as long as you only spend a limited amount on it per week. The rest of the time you can go any out with friends or play your favorite sport. You are in social studies class and you have to make a project on same place across the globe. How do you learn about this faraway place? to your computer and look it up on the web. I believe researching online os much better than reading about it in a book. Why? When using the internet you can search the exact information you need instead looking through all of books. The computer will save you a lot of time when researching. Research shows that student prefer to go to a website with colors, links and pictures as oppose to boring textbook. In addition to improving hand-eye coordination and learning about facinating around the world, computers can help with communication. Not only can you instant message your best friend in @LOCATION1 but you can video chat with your cousin too! I love to see my cousins hit rarely can, so I video chat with er instead. Video achatting, email and instant messaging are all ways to communicate over the computer many more. This your has ll been about trying to the placed and going green and believe it or not but computers are helping a lot with that instead of wasting paper by writing a letter, you can send her an email. Not only does it save a lot of trees but the message gets to her much faster in about @NUM2 seconds to be specific. Computers have saved a lot of time and money computers go back a long time ago, and have developed into great pieces of technology today. Just to recap, the wonderful device can improve hand-eye coordination give people a better and quicker way to learn about the world and so in unusual ways help save the environment. Plus, almost most every college requires that you have a computer and know hot to use it if you don't use a computer or don't have one, you can go to your local library a friend. You might be surprised the things you can do with one.",9
1981,"Dear local newspaper, I have been seeing many adults, kids, work company using computers now a days. My opinion about this is bad for @NUM1 main reasons most things you do on a computer you can do in real life. Most funs things in life you can't do in real life, and being on computer gives no exercise at all. Would you want to fat? I ask this because when your on a computer your not doing anything to give no exercise. The rate of obesidity vs increasing @PERCENT1 of the population every year. This means eventually everyone in the @LOCATION1 will be fat. This could just be solved by ether not supporting the advances of computers or exercising after your on the computer. Would you want to go @CAPS1 world! If your on a computer you can't enjoy something as if you where actually there. You can read about @CAPS2 or see pictures, but @CAPS2 will never be the same feeling as if you actually went on that ride or eating that ice cream. What is the point of a computer if you can do @CAPS2 in real life? You can do many things that computers does. For example if you need to find a word instead of looking @CAPS2 up on the you can. My friend once said, ""@CAPS2's easier to open a dictionary and turn to a page then to turn on your computer and look up a definition. Knowing all the facts why do you use a computer when you can do @CAPS2 in real life, why you want obesidity, or why would you wont to look at something if you could actually go there. Now go and tell your child to stop playing on the computer or stop yourself.",8
1982,"Dear Local newspaper, I strongly believe that people are spending too much time on their computers and spending less time with their family and friends. I also believe that being in @CAPS1 of the computer all the time is distracting them from getting their homework done and grades are dropping. Also these people would starve to death just to not get out the computer and walk to make themself something to eat their health is not good. My first reason why I believe with this statement is because theres to many people that stay at home all day on the computer and they don't go visit there family and friends spend time with them go out for dinner done of that they just want to be home on the computer. Secondly there grades are dropping and they not doing there homework because as soon they get out of school they go straight to the computer. I feel that education comes first. Thirdly people are lazy and when they are attached to the computer they don't want to get up and make themself some food. I am concern because they is not taking care of their health. These are the reason's why I believe that people are spending too much time on the computer than with family and friends or doing homework or eating taking care their health.",7
1983,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know about @PERCENT1 of human race spends their time on the computer. You might say that is ridiculous, but its true. In almost ever home the have either a desktop computer or a laptop, rather they use it for research, communication, or even just to have fun, but I know some people think different. Some people think that computers are stopping or keeping people from exercising, enjoying nature, and even stopping them from interacting with family and friends. Now I think that is stupid, but if you still don't agree with me read on. Why do people say that computers stop some people from exercising and having fun. When you can have fun and you can exercise on the computer. I know you are thinking how can you exercise on the computer. To tell the truth it is simple all you have to do is decide what time of exercise do you want. Once you do that, it is your decision to do the exercise or not so people need to stop blaming things like on the computer because its not the computers falt that some people are just to lazy to do any exercise. Plus you can have fun on the computer. You can play games, and you can even shop on the computer now. Just try you just might like it. Are you enjoying this research about nature on your computer. I bet you are. In your head I know you are probably saying that you can go out side and enjoy nature or read a book and enjoy nature, but say you see a pretty flower and you don't know what it is called and you want to learn more about it, but your book doesn't have that specific flower in. So the only choice you have is to use your computer to find the information on your beautiful flower but you do more than find a research on a flower on the computer you can look up things in history that you didn't know or you can even find out things about your favorite animal or even your favorite sports team or player. You still don't with me about the computers, if you don't then just read on. Alright now from information I have found out that you think peop can't communicate nor interact with each other using a computer, but they can. Some people use computers to communicate with their family members and their friend. They would even be able to see each other if they have a webcam, but say that their is some that doesn't have a phone and they are able unable to go out side. They only way they can communicate is by a computer. Still it there are people out their that would sit in front of the computer than go and sit out sit with their families than that is their buiness. Now I know you agree with me now. Its not the computers fault that some people are just to lazy to do anything but sit there and stare at the computer. It's their buisness it they don't have fun, or communicate or even get off their buts and exercise, that is their buisness.",10
1984,"Dear newspaper editor, @CAPS1 are a great advancement in technology. They are helpful lin life however they take away a lot of your life. People use computers too much and not enough time exercising, being outside, and spending time with friends or family. The @CAPS1 does have a negative affect on people. People dont exercise enough any more. Fewer and fewer people go to the gym every month. The reason for this is because of other things, like computers, to ocupy their time. Computers are used for people to do school work, fun, or for their job. Children do home work and type essays all the time on the @CAPS1. They also play games on the internet or go on websites to talk with friends like @CAPS2. Even adults use computers at work or work at home with a @CAPS1. With all that is availible on a @CAPS1, when will people workout? This hapens to be one of the leading causes for weight gain in the @LOCATION1. No one exercises their body anymore, just their hand on the mouse and eyes on the screen. Fresh air is one of the most refreshing things outside. People dont take advantage of these wonderful things in nature because they lock themselves inside and use the @CAPS1. Peoples lives revolve around the @CAPS1 so much, that they dont camp, fish, or swim anymore. The @CAPS1 doesn't move away from sight of some kids. That isn't healthy at all. Going outside and playing sports is however. Trees and forests are being cut down more and more and soon there wont be much left. Get up from the @CAPS1 and go out before it is too late and nothing is left. Soon you will learn about wilderness by the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS1 alone. When do you see your whole family in a year? Christmas? Thanksgiving? That is not enough. You should spend most of your live with relatives or even just friends. Talking face to face with them is not a usual thing for people anymore. Now you can comunicate through typing on the @CAPS1. It isn't the same as talking in person. The @CAPS1 cant send you their expression on their face when you tell a joke. All it will tell you is @CAPS3 @CAPS3 @CAPS3 or @CAPS6. But what is that to you? Just another word or phrase. Plus, a @CAPS1 cant give you a hug to show the other persons affection towards you. You cant hear their voice or their laugh, or see their face unless you spend time with them. Computers cant keep you warm at night people do. As you can see, computers are on advance in technology, but use too much of our time. Computers dont help us lose weight, see the wilderness, or give you love like a family does. You cant replace your life because you reglet wasteing it on the @CAPS1 @CAPS7 it is gone it is gone for good. If you let it a @CAPS1 will completely consome you life.",10
1985,"Computers are a tectinacal advancement in today's society. I think computer benift society. First, you can talk to people online. Also, they teach hand eye coordination.

With a computer you call people and @CAPS1 for free online, there are some programs that are @PERCENT1 free that allow that next, with a computer you can always stay intouch with someone @CAPS3 matter where they are.

You know whats @CAPS4 @CAPS5!!!, Those people who have @CAPS3 hand eye coordination. First of all, when your in gym and some retard can't catch a @CAPS4 it's pretty lame. Also, with a computer you can learn that and stop being the kid that in gym class is always, picked last because he can't catch @CAPS5! Next, seriously it really grinds my years. When people have the technology to change something and they do nothing. Lastly, one day your really going to need to learn how to catch and you won't be able too.

Ever have trouble trying to find a piece of research for a school project. Well baby, if thats that case, you need are @CAPS3 product rulled computers. First of all, computers are the future @CAPS6 you want to know just google it. Also, some really dumb people disagree with me well screw them because cool people know thats a load of dierru!

1986,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you imagen living in a world with out any computers? Computers help you get in contact with anyone, gives you the ability to learn faraway places and gives you all the education you need. This is why I believe that having computer benefits society. While your setting infront of your computer being on a website like facebook.com and you notice many @CAPS3 people who joined that website. You start to notice a picture of one of your old friends from years ago, and you quickly get in with them. This is how the internet and computers @CAPS2 show that @PERCENT1 of people who have computer find their long lost friends, sisters,parent and many more. I remember a time when my mom was on the computer chating with a friend of hers from @NUM1 years ago. When my mom found her she was very jubilant than she invited her over and they got to catch up on so many things. Wouldn't you like that to be you, finding many of your old friends and siblings? The computer has so many websites that help you learn about the world, and helps you get to so many places that you never heard about. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 magazine states that the computer helps many people get to places with having the exact direction of them. Statistic shows that at least @PERCENT2 of the people who go on vacation tpo faraway places use many websites, such as @ORGANIZATION1 to get to where they need to go. In having computer would help out so many people who help out so many people who are @CAPS3 to states like conneticute. Do you remember back in time when you were more months of school you, quit? Now having computers and the internet would help out so many young kids even grown ups still get the education they need. @CAPS2 that I found out was that at least @PERCENT3 of people take online classes to get the education they mused. A proffesional @CAPS6 @PERSON1 said that from the @PERCENT3 of people who take online classes more than @PERCENT2 pass with a diploma or degree. Wouldn't you want that to be you? In conclusion, having computers will definitly benefit the society in many ways. Computers would help because it will give people a chance to get in contact with anymore give the ability to learn faraway places and most importantly get the education they need had. Thats why @NUM2 believe having computers is a good idea.",9
1987,My opinion about computers is that they help hand-eye coordination. This is good as it helps retiexes and reaction time improve. Also you can learn about famous people and places. So this has to be good for the brain. This is why I think computers have very good effects on the human brain.,2
1988,"Dear @CAPS1 paper, I think that the evolving technology has a better impact on society with newer technology things become more portable and brings people together. Technology also keeps people from being bored. First off the old computers were un realistic. They took up whole rooms and were slow. Now computers or anything technological can fit in a pocket. Computers are a lot faster and more reliable. Being portable also allows people to go anywhere and still be connected. With technology comes connections. People are able to talk to people halfway across the world with technology. Cellphones are a great idea also. A child could get lost in the mall, or an adult get lost in the. Either way, the person can call for help. Television allows a person to be updated on whats happening around them. We all know what its like to be completely bored. But, with new technology, anybody can be entertained. There are games online music, endless possibilities. Now @CAPS2 are becomming less bored. By not being bored, @CAPS2 wont eat whenever they feel like it, therefore they are healthier. People can still exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with their family and friends. They can do it all with technology. Technology is portable, allowing people to go into nature with it. People can be connected with technology. Boredom is also cut down with advances in technology.",7
1989,"I will be writing about people that like learning computers. Also people that don't like learning about computers. First I will be talking about people that like computers. For example, people like learning hand-eye cordinate, learning faraway places and people. Also to talk online with friend and other people. People could learn how to create their on website. Like myspace that was created by a guy. People love spending alot of time on their computer. Which is sometimes not good for them. They could sometimes get blind and they nees glasses. When they are myspace and they talk to somebody and that person didn't mean that he or she said they could cause trouble. Thats why being on the computer its not good. Sometimes is good or bad being on the computer or not being on the computer. eople like doing exercising and not being on the computer. People also don't like doing exercise and like being on the computer. So people could do both couple of hours doing exercise and a couple of hours playing or being on the computer. Now people can't complane for spending to much time being on the computer or complaning that people exercise for no reason. This is the reasson why people like learning about computer. Also people that don't like being on the computer. So this is my story that I talked to you about.",8
1990,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of people using computers then going outside is if you stay, inside all day doing nothing but sitting by the computer is a waist of time. What's so important on the computer that catches anyones attention like really I know you can e-mail friends, family but you can also call them and meet up somewhere so you can got out to eat or go hang out or something because staying home on the computer is'nt realy healthy fer you I mean like you can miss out on a lot like a birthday party or maybe someone in his/her family past away or just a speacial event that someone wants you to go to. So you can support them but if your just at home sitting on your butt on the computer no one is going to be needing you. Matter a fact they'll probably forget about you and then when you need them they want be there to help you out because you weren't there for them so thats why we we should all get up and hang up the mouse and put it to rest and go outside to have some fun.",7
1991,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I agree that computers benefit society. Some of my reasons are: They teach hand-eye coordination, gives kids and parents the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and lastley you can talk with friends and family members. Hand-eye coordination isvery helpful. When children get older most jobs deal with computers and they will need to learn how to type. Studies show that @PERCENT1 more people that know how to type howe better jobs then people what don't. Gives people the ability to learn about faraway people and places and maybe even religons. With computers people will learn about other king of people around the world. They can learn what they eat, what time these school starts in the @TIME1, and much more. You can also learn about places like @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, france and many other places. There are pictures, descriptions, and the type of animals life there. Lastley you an learn about people's religons. My last reason computers benifit society is that you can talk to people on certain websites. Is you have family members that live faraway you can talk to them or video chat with them. Maybe your bestfriend moved across the country you can also talk to them on websites like @ORGANIZATION2, twitter, facebook, and @CAPS2. Even though computers are fun and helpful you should always take some time to go outside and enjoy nature. Thats why I think computers benifit society. They teach hand-eye coordanation, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and talk to family or friends.",8
1992,"Dear The @CAPS1 Have you ever been bullied before? Cyberbullying is worse and it is not fun. Computers can be quite dangerus and very time consuming. Some people spend hours and some times days on the computer. It gets in the way of many activities and deprives time from friends and family. Many people that spend most of ther tim on the computer becom over whieght due to lack of exersize. ""@CAPS2 get about @NUM1 calls a month complaining about cyber bulling. And some suasidal atempts."" says officer @PERSON2 ove the @CAPS3 police department. Being cyber bullied is a very dandurus situation. Sights such as @CAPS4, A.I.M., @CAPS5 and @CAPS6, are all sights that people can be bullied on. @PERSON3 spends most of his time on the computer. He stays on for hours and hours at a time. One @CAPS1 his mom had to go out of town. She left him a list of things he needed to do by the time she got back: clean room, practice trombone, walk the dog, do homework, feed the dog, and work on a project for boy scouts. @PERSON3 got on the computer and did not get off untill his mom got home. None of the things on the list were done. He got in huge trouble. Did you know that kids miss @PERCENT1 of there family bonding time while they ar on the computer? ""More half of my patients are obece because they are on the computer when they should be going outside, running around, working out walking the dog are exersising in general. This makes it harder for them to loes wheight"" says @PERSON1, spesialist in wheight, gain, loss, obesity, exersise and diet. People should be exersizing much more instaid of sitting @CAPS1 after @CAPS1 at the computer. It's not healthy. Computers arn't really benifiting our sasiaty. They are putting as in many ways. People should get off the computer more and do something active.",8
1993,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion for this letter is that we should have computers because it can help you and they are better and the technogy is better. First is that computers can help you learn how to type. If you did not have one back in the day. They also can help you learn about people that were or are famous. Also you can look up things like the news and what happened back then. You can make charts for school, work, or even home on the computer. When you what to travel you can buy tickets online and maybe get goods seats. These are a few reasons why the computers are helpful. Second the computers are way better tha type writers because they are less work for you. Because when type writers were around the buttons were hard to push and you had to push the proper back and froth. But if you have a compter it is a lot easier, the keys are light to push and the computer auto-madicly goes on the other line itself. You don't need to keep putting paper in the computer because does that for you too. This is why compters are way better than a typewriter. Finally is that technoly is better because back in the day you had to write letters to people and had to wait for weeks for it to come back. Or it might get lost in the mail room so the person might never get it. But with compters you can send an e-mail to people and the can get in two seconds flat. And it is a lot faster than mailing a letter in the mail. And this is why technology is way better than sending letter in the mail than just sending on computer. @CAPS1 opion is that we should have computers because it can help us much better.",8
1994,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers! Who needs them any way I know not @CAPS1 people do! Computer effect anyone for various reasons just like a viris or spam that leads to your computer being broken. Yet there are still worse like cyber bulling and scams that can bring you down to debt. Now I you to listen up and head on. One reason computers are iritating is their virises they sound all over the internet just waiting to eat your computer away. About @PERCENT1 of people who use the computer get shut down by a viris. Soon messages do the same they pop-up right on the screen sometimes saying ""You have just won the million dollar prize"" @CAPS1 people are careless enough and just click the message, as then another box pops up asking for impormation. This is where scams come in. Another reason would be scams. Scams are one of the worst, like I said about an information box will pop-up asking @LOCATION1 , @CAPS2 security number, phone number, adress and name. How is doing enter, some scams will show you much you said. @CAPS1 people claim they dont pay a, but they actually did it @CAPS3 in debt. My last example who computer cyber bullying, over @PERCENT2 of people. Cyber bulling is when one person on the internet or a or brings them big verbal, now you dont want that to you, do you? I remember when kids hated me and picked on me, @CAPS4 I stayed home but get on the. I still get @CAPS4 now what ever you do just do the right thing and don't be like me or any other american that has a time with any computer just don't.",8
1995,"Dear Newspaper editor, @CAPS1 this, you're late for an interview when you realize you've forgotten the address you were emailed. So you hop on the computer, but before you know it it's been an hour! This is because I think computers are very time consuming and you don't enjoy everything that's around you. You also don't spend enough time exersizing because people are always infront of on a computer, and finally you should be talking to people face to face, it would build a better relationship between you. So please listen to why I thin computers can be an agrivating item in people's lives. When you first go on a computer, your first thought is mostly, ""@CAPS2, only for a minute,"" @CAPS3, that minute can turn into an hour before you know it. This is because when you're of something and there are so many possibilities of what you could do, you want to do them all, and everything is pretty much docked out. So you wouldn't realize what time had gone by, anything that was going on around you. How many times have you gone up to someone on the computer and said something to them, and you just got a nod, or maybe even no response back? I know I have, because you don't really hear what people are saying to you, because your so-hipnotized and focuse don what's happening on the computer. Secondly, if you're always on the computer, you're not getting enough time for exersizing and fresh air. You can't just be kept inside not moving all day, more and more people all over the world have been gaining wait for lack of exersize. Do you really want to see yourself, your family being in front of the computer? Of course not! you want to see them healthy having fun, and outdoors! Also, when you're on the computer, and it is very time consumming. You won't be able to get what you need to do, like papers, homework, bills, anything! More so, yes, you can talk to many people over the computer, but wouldn't much rather see them in person. When you talk to someone over the computer it can be very dangerous sometimes, also many people are more willing to say harsher things when it's over the computer and not face to face. And wouldn't you rather sorte a conflict out comly, then using bash mean language? Also when you're talking to someone in person, face to face; it builds a better relationship between you two. Iwould much rather being hanging out, outside playing with my bestfriend, than gossipping on the computer with her. Also since people are more willing to say things not face to face, if you didn't go on the computer as much it would be easier and not as many arguments. In conclusion, I think that we shouldn't be on the computer as much because it 's very time consuming and wasteful, people need to be spending more time outside and exersizing to stay healthy, and finally, people should be talking more face to face because it would build a better relationship. So please listen to my pleading, People need to stop spending so much time on the computor, for all of these reasons and many more.",10
1996,"To whom @CAPS6 my concern, I think computers are great to have in socity. I believe this because @CAPS6 allows you to talk to your friends. Share information with relatives far away and lastley @CAPS6 tells you about local news and weather. I will explain this more if you read on. First of all did you ever get out of school and say ""I was supposed to tell someone something""? I know I have. With computers you can see if your friend was online and instant message them on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. Also if you live in a large town and there is more than one school you can meet some one that goes to a different school, and stay in touch with them. This is good because you can make more friends. I rember when I was a littler kid and met this kid from pre school if I had a computer I could of still known that kid but I don't anymore. Second of all if you have family or friends far away from you or even in a differnt country you can stay in touch with them. this is helpful when they have mybe a baby they can send you pictures of @CAPS6. For example when I was about @NUM1 or @NUM2 my cusin @CAPS3 moved to @CAPS4. He had a baby boy and he emailed my family in @CAPS5 pictures of him. If we did not have computers I would of never seen him till they come to visit. Lastley computers keep you in touch with local news and weather. This is great because I would know if there was a forrest fire in @LOCATION1. If you say you can whatch the news and weather on tv your right and wrong. What happins if you have a broken tv or even if you missed the new program and @CAPS6 wont be on a couple of hours. I rember when @CAPS6 was @NUM3 oclock in the @TIME1 and @CAPS6 started pooring rain and my mom was flying in. I went on the computer to look if @CAPS6 was passing. I never would of know if she could fly into the air port if idident have a computer. In conclution you can see the computer is one of the best tools you can own. I say this because you can talk with your friends, get information from far away family and friends. Lastley you can check local wether and events. I hope this esay changed your mind about computers beining bad.",9
1997,"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1 are some of the reason way I think computers are good for people who live in other states can keep in context with there family. Another is it can help you with when your at work. Lastly, @ORGANIZATION1 a high school in @LOCATION1 who works with computers everyday. @CAPS1 are my three reasons way computers are not just good there helpful. First keeping in context with your family. Say a family member move to @LOCATION2 you haven't talk to them in days, then a death pops up in the family its his grandma. He has no phone but they do have a labtop you can @CAPS2-mail him or her. Then they can come down to the funerl and share his or her memory of there grandma. that a key reason way computers are good for you. Second, when people go to work, they sometimes need a computer to help them plan meets have lunchs, and maybe even partys. Teachers use the for puting grades in it then find the total grade for the marking period. I hate to say this but you cant lie you guys probadly use them too. That another great reason why computers helpful. Lastly, @ORGANIZATION1 good school. But they made there whole school around computers. Students get to know what homework is by there computers. Also classes when there in art class it helps. then at the end of the day you got to take it home and keep throughout the school year. That a good thrid reason why computer helpful. Those three reason explain why computers are helpful and they don't have a effect on people. One you type need for staying in context with family. Second you need them for work. lastly, students need them at @ORGANIZATION1 for classes, homework, and others. @CAPS1 are way computers don't effect the community they help the community. ",8
1998,"Dear Newspaper, A lot of people are talking about if having computers effects are society. In my opinion, I somewhat think that's true. @CAPS6 just seens people spend a lot of time on the computers. And this is effecting are society because this can lead to life changing conditions, @CAPS6's stopping us to live a healthy life, and @CAPS6 impacts your body. My first reason was that @CAPS6 can lead to life changing conditions. And what I mean by that is sevarl sites on the computer contain graphics, and flashs. And my next door neighbor's son @PERSON2, always went on the computer. And in a result he had a seizure. @CAPS6's reala sad, but @CAPS6 happened, now seizures became part of @PERSON2's life... That's something you @MONTH1 want to take in considerations. Another thing I thought was that @CAPS6 was stopping us from living a healthy life. Nutrition expert @PERSON1, quoted: ""I use to be fat, I always hated exercising, and two of those reasons was because of playing videogames and staying on the computer. And those two things prevented me from living healthy. Ten years later I lost some weight because I was committed to stop playing games and stay off the computer. "" In my opinion this says a lot. Finally my last reason about computers is that @CAPS6 really impacts your body. Going on computers no exercise, and no fresh air builds a bad habit. @CAPS6 means your @CAPS1-A-@CAPS2-@CAPS3 @CAPS4!! and @CAPS6 really does change your personality. I took a quick little surevey. @CAPS6 said of @CAPS5 that don't have jobs, but have computers in household. The computers makes us @CAPS4 enough that we can't even apply for a job... this needs to be a wake-up call. Concluding this I think having computers are okay but having too much isn't. I know the debate would still be going on. But I just wanted you guys to know were I am on @CAPS6. Remember what I said, @CAPS6 can lead to life-changing conditions its stopping us from trying to live a healthy life, And @CAPS6 really impacts are body. I recommend you guys read this again.",9
1999,"In todays technology filled world, using computers is a growing among us. Everyday computers gather and give endless amount of information like an international school at your home. While many people embrace computers as a much needed things in their abodes, others disagree and compromise. I write to you the local Newspaper for you to agree with me that computers good effects on people. I have three reasons to support this. First it helps increase hand-eye coordination to people who use them. Second, computers give others the ability to gain knowledge on knowing people and places. Lastly computers let people talk to others through computers. Now, I will begin to elaborate. Have you never been a good better at a game of baseball? or been a good passer in basket ball? As surprising as it @MONTH1 seem to the ones who do not know one way to improve hand-eye coordiantion through the usage of computers. Now, just using computers for typing won't grow you the skills to get you @ORGANIZATION1 best these are programs and games that, with today's technology can improve ones hand-eye coordination. For example the army would use computes simulation to train soldiers hand-eye coordination and then mandatory survival skills for when they go to. It is also plausible to any profesional athletes. Computer simulation gives edges and with that go to my next reason. Since now first thought of it, @CAPS1 aid older techniques such s were not reliable. So think computers to get the use need to the for without computers wouldn't know what happen to haiti for. But with computers had fully destroyed the total cost of damageand know help dy. So computers are good when it comes down. Computers are also great for the ability to with through a wide range of programs and websites. This is for because if one websites to speak to friends and family not see them they would still talk one time, my dad even to see relatives but didn't go. Use both computers skype we still stayed. In conclusion computers are great for hand-eye coordination keeping on other countries and staying in to with family or friends.",9
2000,"Dear newspaper writer, In the late @NUM1 people had created the @CAPS1 I had studied that lots of People loss eye site, The people became obeised, and enjoying life. Read on and I will explain to you @CAPS3 these @CAPS1 realy effect lots of people. My @CAPS2 reason, @CAPS3 I think that Computers effect people @CAPS8 because people have loss their eyesite from the computers because your eyes caint look at one thing @CAPS14 like three hours. @CAPS14 example doctors had continuesly had told paticants that @CAPS4 you look at a @CAPS5 close you can loose eyesite a @CAPS5 and a @CAPS1 are the same thing because they both can watch @CAPS5 @CAPS6. more and more people will begin to loose their eye site. This needs to stop. My @CAPS7 reason @CAPS8 that lots of people are not enjoying reality because @CAPS1 become addictive because they make new games and websites every month and its hard to stop playing on the @CAPS1. I remember like two months ago they had this new game on @CAPS9 called @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 and you @CAPS27 to play with people from around the world and that game was @CAPS13 but then I was playing the oneday @CAPS14 shops @CAPS15 and dinner and instead I ate @CAPS16 I play my game. I gained @NUM2 pounds that week @CAPS17 I new something wast rite. @CAPS17 I decided not to play on game hangout. that its better being outside then sitting many hours and playing on the @CAPS1 all day. This @CAPS8 @CAPS3 lots of people @CAPS27 @CAPS18 and to help them by banning computers @CAPS14 awhile. My third reason @CAPS8 that people @CAPS27 viriuses! on the Computers or @CAPS19 into the Computers and @CAPS27 all your data like creditcards billing information and even find out where you live. A long time ago I heard that there were alot of viriuses that People had sended to a @CAPS1 and stole all their personal @CAPS20. @CAPS17 @CAPS4 you @CAPS27 a @CAPS1 that's @CAPS22 going to happen and you would have to pay like every month @CAPS23 @CAPS17 that you will prevent viriuses thats alot. This needs to stop all it does @CAPS8 bring @CAPS25 to your Family, This needs to stop. Know @CAPS26 I got your attention I need your help and all the people who does aprove of my opinion need your help support too. These are my three reasons again. One @CAPS8 that people loose their eyesite, @CAPS7 @CAPS8 that lot people aren't enjoying reality and final reason @CAPS8 that people @CAPS27 viriuses on the @CAPS1.",9
2001,"Dear: Local Newspaper I think computers are really good for people to use because you can learn a lot about everything. Computers help people on their jobs and in everything it helps kids with there homework and thats really good you can buy stuff using the computer so you won't have to go anywhere. Computers help people pay their bills and stuff using a computer you can check out anything you want to know about or anyplace you want to see and it gives you directions to go places and stuff. Computers help you go to any website and it gives you any information you want or that you need thats really good and when people shop on line is less than if you go to the store thats why a lot of people shop on line because is less money. Kids use computers to play video games with friends and you can talk on the computers with friends and family. Computers are really good help to people because if you want to go anywhere buy anything or pay bills. You can use the computer to do all that stuff. Kids use it to do school work like projects and stuff it helps them save their work so they won't lose anything. People order anything they need thats really cool. Teachers learn something new using the computer and they help kids learn new things. Kids use the computers to go on like @CAPS1 and stuff they can wach music videos talk to friends and play video games. People can even use computers to make music and to cool stuff. People use computers to get music live ituns and videos, movies and games on like an ipod. I think computers are really good they can do anything you want you can go in any website and stuff you can find a lot of information that you need for like a job or school work people should kee using computers they can do anything you need and they help a lot.",8
2002,"I not believe computers have a good effect on people. They have bad effects on people and are over used. They are like this for some reasons. They make people spend less time exercising, the outside world, and even time with family and friends so if we keep on using computers like this it will hurt us. Firstly, people are using computers an increasing rate and studies show the more people use computers the less there exercise. And with less people exercising it will add to the problems @CAPS1 @CAPS2 with ability. I would say about half the kids in my school are over weight and when look back pictures of the eight grade from years ago there had half as many obese or over weight students because computers either weren't around or used to much. And statistics show that people to be a lot healtier than those without. So us a result computers are anything but beneficial becomes they mate people less time exercising. Secondly, with people using computer so much they dont enjoy nature as much as they should. Statictics show that people who spend at least a hour outside a day are not only healtier, but here higher test scores. And if less people go outside and enjoy nature, less people will see it significant. For example a recent study shows that @PERCENT1 of people who dont go outside everyday are less to. And that means the more people use the computer the more on earth there is going to be. So as a conclusion computers are not beneficial because they make people spend less time enjoying nature. Lastly, computers take away from time that people can spend with friends and family. It's very important to spend time with family. For example statistics show that of people who are in preson didn't have good relationship with there families. and another study showed that students have @PERCENT2 better grades if they spend at least @NUM1 hours there families a as a computers are not beneficial they time your family. Computers in no way are beneficial could do better things like exercise, enjoy nature or even spend time with love ones. So I urge you do not use computers so much and do other things because.",9
2003,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern on the local paper, I firmly believe that computers are the best invention since the telephone and cars! They allow people to stay in touch with the world around them. They even have thousands of typing games and ""how to's"" for you to strengthen your skills. These great inventions allow people to keep in touch in a whole new and much more efficent way. The world isn't like it used to be. People come from all different place around the world and they often forget the most important thing about them, their roots. Not knowing your own culture is like not knowing the other half of you. Luckily, computers have the ability to allow you to find out about your ancestors and what kind of people they were. It also allows you to learn about other cultures in far away places. Suppose you are going on a family trip to @LOCATION1. Wouldn't you want to know the types of clothes they wear, foodds they eat, weather climates, currency? I certenly hope so. How embarrasing would that be not to know any history anout the country you're visiting? As I noted before the world is changing all around us everyday. There are new inventions, government, ideas, statistics, ect just to name a few. I personally think it's truely horrid to deprive people of what is happening in the world around us. Computers can solve this problem in a matter of seconds! People ofteb complain that computers are hard to work or they just don't have the skills to work it. However, there is a solution that millions have overlooked on the internet. Here are hundreds of thousands of games and softwares that enable you to learn any of the skills you could possably need to work a computer. It's truely amazing how rapidly you pick up the skills of hand-eye coordination and typing. These are two extremely important skills every person needs to be successfull in life. And computers offer that to you. I think it is clear that communication is the key to human nature. Computers have multiple ways for people to communicate quickly and efficiently. You can talk with friends, family and work. People often lose friends they used to have due to simple lack of communication. With computers this problem is saved and you are instantly reconnected with them. It is obvios to everyone we are in a bad economy. This means that anyone's job is at stake everyday. If you miss a deadline because you didn't know when it was you can lose your job instantly. However, with computers you can easily ask someone when the due date is. For all my reasons above, I can honestly say that computers are a neccesity in today's world. if you want to lose your culture, connection with people and life long skills, then you'll never get to be successful. Think about it. Do you?",11
2004,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS3, @CAPS4's, and @ORGANIZATION2. These are all different brand names for computers. All @ORGANIZATION1 these wonderful divises can help you, the everyday @CAPS5, communicate with people that you would never expect to. You could easily make a friend over in @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION4! @CAPS11 you are writing to your good friend in @LOCATION4, you are using the keyboard to type. If you become experienced enough, like my sister @CAPS6, you can even type without lookindg at the keys. This hand-eye coordination can help you in many things outside @ORGANIZATION1 the computer world. @CAPS10 you come home from school and you have a boat load @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS7 homework, the computer can help you finish that homework and learn about far-away places too. Wouldn't it be wonderful to take a trip to @LOCATION2 and see the @LOCATION1 and the @ORGANIZATION1? With a computer you can go to all @ORGANIZATION1 those places without leaving the comfort @ORGANIZATION1 your home. @CAPS10 you, reader are reading about @LOCATION4, you will find out that they have different views on what is sociallly acceptible and what isn't. @CAPS10 and if you go to @LOCATION4, you can already be ahead @ORGANIZATION1 the curve. How annoying would it be to get all A's on your report card except for that one lousy @CAPS8 on in @CAPS7? It would be terrible right? Well no more. One out @ORGANIZATION1 every four people who do their homework with the aid @ORGANIZATION1 the computer get better scores on quizes and tests. What about talking to your friends @CAPS11 you are doing your homework to ask them a question; wouldn't that be great? I love my camp friends. I love them more than my own siblings, but I don't get to talk to them much during the year. With computers that all changed. I know that some people think that kids should go outside more and be with their family lets get realistic,what family wants their teen around anyway? They are moody and unplesent. ""@CAPS10 my child will have a homework question,"" my mother says. ""I would want them to have the flexability to e-mail their teacher and ask them."" @CAPS11 all @ORGANIZATION1 your children are type, type, typing away they are learning valuable hand-eye coordination. Baseball, tennis, football, lacross and many other sports require a mountain @ORGANIZATION1 hand-eye coordination. Catching a ball or hitting it requires a lot @ORGANIZATION1 skill and practice and that is wear typing comes handy. I am sure you know this reader, but most teens can type without looking down to see what they are doing. Some people think that they, teens, are just being lazy and not getting enough exersize, but with the boat-load @ORGANIZATION1 homeworks, how can they. (That is a whole another story.) @CAPS12, @CAPS12, @CAPS12. That is the sound @ORGANIZATION1 letters being pushed down on the keyboard @ORGANIZATION1 computers everywhere. It is also the sound @ORGANIZATION1 communication. The sound @ORGANIZATION1 the world becoming one continent instead @ORGANIZATION1 seven. It is the sound @ORGANIZATION1 learning about other people's culture and what is important to other people. It is the sound @ORGANIZATION1 hand-eye coordination that will make the next @CAPS13 @PERSON2 or the next @PERSON1. It is the sound, dear readers, @ORGANIZATION1 learning.",10
2005,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I am writing this letter to inform you on my opinion, on the effects computers have on people. I do not agree with the idea of computers because, people spend way too much time on them. Some people aren't who they say they are (which creates a danger zone for many!) @CAPS1 there are many who @MONTH1 go on the computer for inappropiate matters. Hopefully by the end of this letter, you will very much agree with me. My first reason of thinking is because, people spend way too much time on computers. Which could get in the way of reality with them. Enstead of going outside for a walk or even to play... people are rushing home for what? Computers. Enstead of going home to do homework students rush to go on the computer. The computer can and will distract people from their responsibilities. Before you know it, your whole life will resolve around computers. Then there's people who complain about their weight! So go on and excerise, go outside and be active! But no... they go and go on the computer. When just sitting there, and gaining wait without even knowing. Secondly, some people don't stick with their true identity. They're not who they say they are! And this is a major problem, exspecially with chat rooms. It creates a danger zone for all, exspecially with young kids. Someone could lie and say they're your age... but they're not! Then try to become your friend, and before you know it they wana meet you in person! But what for? Most people dont think about that, they're just so happy & excited they got a new friend. Or this new guy that says he's your age and always complementing you. Before you even know it you become the person all over the news and newspaper known as ""@CAPS2"". Finally, there are many people who go on the computer for a more inappropriate things! This can become a problome with young kids and grownups. Same for nute pictures and even some for poronogrephy. Some are ""under age"" and some are ""overage"". Either way, thats just discousting to me! These kind of things shouldn't even be allowed on the computer at all. And people who have an addiction to these kind of things, the computer won't help... its just feeding them... making them worse. In conclution, now you have read and hopefully understand my reason of thought. Because of how much time people spend on it, some people aren't who they say they are, and @CAPS1 using and abusing the computer for inappropriate reasons.",9
2006,"Hey! Do you like computers? I understand the issue about what effects computers have on people. I think computers help people educational and socially. Computers help you make new friends, computers can teach you many things, and computers help people educationally. Computers help you make new friends. I made over @NUM1 new friends on the computer. They all are very kind people. Some are fun to talk to and others are fun to play games with online, like checkers. Computers can teach you maty things, Computers can teach people many cultures and about different countries. Without computers some people probably won't know as much about other countries or cultures. Computers also teach us about history. If there are no computers we probably won't learn as' much about history as you do in school. Computers help people educaionally. Don't you want a good education? computers teach us math. Soical studies, and many more subjects. I think computers are very helpful. Computers help you make new friends, computers can teach you many things, and computers help people educationally. Please take my opinions seriously! Computers have good effects on people!",7
2007,"Whats your opinion on how computers affect peoples lives? I agree that it really does affect our lives for thse three reasons they start to gain alot of weight. they don't go outside as much, and they dont spend alot of time with there family. If people spend all there time being on the computer they'll gain alot of weight then wonder why. Its because they don't get out the house and excercise enough or maybe not at all. For example my dad use to do that all the time, they one day he realized he was gaining alot of weight. So what did he do, he started to work out alot more. He's still on the computer all the time but he excercises in between. Us humans need fresh air come in a while. For our bodies to function the way there suppose to. But how is that suppose to happen if you stay at home on the computer and don't go outside. I ounce heard on to that if your body doesnt get the fresh air that it needs that you'll get used to the costaphobic air in your house. That's not good either. You'll probaly start to forget what day it is, what month cause you spend your time on the computer all day."" @CAPS1 my mother. If you spend all of your time worring about myspace. @CAPS2, and aim you'll forget about the important things in your life. Your family. I think is way better than myspace, @CAPS2, and aim. ""I say cause you could get tired of all those things but you never get tired of your family. Your family will start to fell that the computer is way better then them and it shouldn't be that way. Spend time with your family go places with them parly. Play board games with them. Cause remember you can replace. Myspace, @CAPS2, and aim but you cant replace the people that love you and care for you which is your family. In conclusion you should think about it. If you agree with my three reasons you start to gain weight, don't get enough fresh air, and don't send alot of time with your family. But after your done reading my essay i hope you change your mind and agree with me. Your life is way more important than being on the computer all day.",8
2008,"Dear local newspaper, Computers have a big role in our daily lifes. They are important and we leave it to them to do a lot of our work for us. Ther is such thing as being smart about using your computer. There is also over abusing the time we spend on it. But computers can't be taken away from us, we just got to use them wisely, and these are some of my reasons @CAPS1 reason I think we are affected by computers is because it actually helps out our environment. Going on the computer to do work. And it also alows us to pay our bills. This is a big ordeal. If we use computers more to do this stuff we will help out our environment by not using as much paper. Just imagine, people won't need to worry about wild life as much just because of a computers? Well, yeah it is just doing bad for us if we are on it @NUM1 but im pretty sure if we limit our time from the computer we will make a change! Secondly, in school or at our jobs we might get a book that was published in @DATE2. It is now a new century, and not everything is up to date. Computers always have the latest news. I believe they will now only help us with the knowledge over @DATE1. But computers will inform us on not just whats going on in our state but whats going around the world today. They help us and reminds us on now. We should change and make our world a better place. Lastly, I think computers are a important thing because we don't only see whats going on with people and stuff, but we can also interact with them. As kids we like to meet new people and over the computer is a great way. This can help us practise communicating with people. As long as youre not on it @NUM1. But we are teenagers what do you expect. teens are all down for meeting now people. As long as we are safe with it. That is another reasong I think computers help us. I think computers are a possitive way to help our environment. Thank you for taking the time to hear my side.",8
2009,These are reasons people should support advances in technology computers are good way to keep in touch with friends that move or family that live for away. In the current job market you have to learn how to work a computer. Computers are very useful if you know how to use it correctly. When it comes down to it. It's their choice. Wether they go out to play or stay inside. You can say anything you want to people if they don't want to something they're hot going to. Those were my reasons.,4
2010,"Dear newspaper writers, Have you ever used a computer and learned of a way that it improves your day and makes life more interesting? Well, if you have, then you have had a taste of how computers benefit society. I use a computer to help me keep track of which of my favorite producs are being made and i can even watch my favorite shows on the computer. Computers can also help inother ways beyond watching shows and finding out about newly released iems. For instance, they teach hand-eye coordination every time you use the mouse. also, plenty of websites give information about faraway places and other people, and i bet you guys use almost @NUM1 of those websites. Lastly, communication on the web is a major part of people's lives. Just read on, and i'll tell you more about the wonder of computers! First of all, hand-eye coordination improvement is a major issue with computers.I used to have little to no coordination, but now, after using computers, I can use my sense of touch and sight to do anything, even with my bad hand. You must it forget all of the helpful and even fun computer programs made for the sake of teaching coordination. I remember a program hat tought me how to easily type letters on the computer without moving my hand around. I only know of two other hand-eye coordination exercises, and they are playing difficult video games for hours and hours and boring physical exercises that don't really help. So, basically, computers are the best way to help your eyes and hands work together. Also, if you want, you can search for info about faraway places such as @LOCATION1, and people such as the man who invented the sandwitch. For example, i recall a time when i had to make a poster for @PERSON1, and i searched on the internet for a icture and information about him, as well as where his @DATE1 championship took place. There also a program called @ORGANIZATION1 which someone to se every inch of our planet. @PERCENT1 of americans use the computer to get their information on people and places. There are some pieces of information that are found on the computer that can't be found in a book. These are some of the reasons that a computer is the best place to get information. Lastly, communication on a computer is fun, and sometimes a necessity. This reminds me of a time when i wrote a letter on the internet to my favorite company about the upcoming robocop movie, and they actually responded to my letter. There is a website called myspace.com which is used for introducing people to other people. There have been instances of communication over the web where people would be hunted or killed after telling the stalker their name and adress, and that is why new privacy systems are made all the time. Before i forget, there are two computer games made for socializing and having fun at the sametime: @CAPS1 of warcraft and second life. Communicating on the internet doesn't just benefit society, it connects it, too. I hope that this letter better helps you understand how important computers are to society. Computers have special ways of helping people learn hand-eye coordination. Information is easily found and in great quantities on the internet. Lastly, the web brings thousands of people together almost everyday. The computer actually helps people live their lives. If they were bad, @PERSON2 wouldn't still make them. Please, make the right decision and support computers the way i do.",11
2011,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 the computer have too much of an impact on our lives? I don't think it @CAPS2, because it is used for so many good causes. One of them is that you can learn things about places you have never heard of. Another one is that you can interact with other people. Also, you can do some online shopping. Beleive it or not the computer isn't all games and facebook. There are other websited that you can learn about things on place and religions that you have never even heard of. Also there are other websited that people write article that tell us about current wars. Other websites can tell us news about celebrities, terrerists, and the presidednt. I know that the computer has a possitive effect on people. Next we have interaction, with the use of a computer you can interact with people from your school, friends, or even cousins. We can do this because we have webcams and internet sites that let you talk to your friends. I know I'm on the computer and I video chat with my cousins and friends. It helps make plans and keep in contact with your family or friends. Also their is a microphone that will let you talk to other people! Trust me computers definetly have a possitive effect on people. We can also use the computer to go shopping. Like I know stop and shop has a peapod delivery system, because say you are really sick or you are elderly and you don't want to come out of the house today you can just go online and pick out your food. Also there is a lot of online book stores, say you really wan't this one book but your local book store doesn't have it you can order it online. Also there are just some essential house goods that any store around doesn't have, you can go online and buy them. And last but not least, clothes. Say you are walking through some stores and you find this beautiful top but you don't have enough money to buy it, you can always go online and find the shirt and it migt be cheaper. The computer has so much possitive effects on today life. So, @CAPS2 the computer have a good effect on life today? Yes! We could go shopping. We could learn about current events that are happening today. Also, we can communicate with others. The computer doesn't just have a possitive effect but it also fun. Now you can go and make a bette decision on if the computer has possitive or negative effects on people. ",9
2012,"Dear newspaper editor, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @CAPS3 and I think computers are a great thing. Three reasons why I think this are: you can learn, people can communicate, and they very fun to use. Hopefully by the time you finish reading, you will also think computers are great and have good effects. While visiting places is great, learning about places is even better. Anyone can surf the web and find tons of facts about anything. Say you wanted to go to @LOCATION1 but your budget was tight. Use the web. There are tons of videos, facts, pictures, and other things on @ORGANIZATION1 world. You still @MONTH1 not be able to ride rides or play games there, but at least you can get a good feeling about @ORGANIZATION1. Also, anyone can learn about other countries! Millions of facts on any country or state no matter where it is. You could even talk with people from around the world, which brings as to @CAPS2 next point. Communication is key. Especially in this day, it is very important to talk and socialize. There are many messaging systems that can be used to communicate. AIM, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @ORGANIZATION2 are just few of e-mail and instant messaging systems. It @MONTH1 take days to get mail to other countries via air-mail. But with e-mail, messages are sent in mere seconds. Also, video chatting is on the rise. If you can't visit someone, then talk through video. You can see and hear each other the entire time. Even though they are almost @NUM1 miles or more away, you can still meet them face-to-face. Boy, all this computer talk sure is fun. Seriously though, computers are very fun. You can go onto game sites or play solitare or even pinball. No more going out to the arcade and spending your parents pay checks. The games are free (depending which website) and, for the most part, fun. But wait, there's more! Are you older and don't like video games and other games? Then watch videos. Need on update on the news but it is long before @LOCATION2 news is on? Then go to a news website. YouTube is also great for videos. Funny, sad, or dramas are all part of the ""tube"" community. So have fun and keep your wallets full. Well, I have told you three reasons why computers are good and have great effects on people. If you still aren't buying it, then get this last reason: the price. As I talked about in previous segments, the cost is low. If you keep the computer well maintained, you can get great things out of it. Some computers can get very high in price, but the average is low. Around @MONEY1 to @MONEY2 on average. So you see, computers are great and have very good effects on people. If you don't believe me, then go out and try one yourself. I am sure you will love it.",10
2013,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 was come to my attention that, although computers are helpful, some people believe are taking more from society than giving. I disagree with this statement. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, help us learn, and allow us to talk to others. Computers are quite helpful to the modern person. Computers allow us to develope many skills at an early age. Many games are now made for computers to help teach small children hand-eye coordination. The games @MONTH1 include hitting a ball in virtual baseball to using a hammer and nails virtually. Many experts say children that develope these skills online are more capable on the real world. In fact studies have shown over @PERCENT1 of children that play educational games exibet well developed, fine motor skills at an early age. This could mean that soon the young people of society will learn faster in sports and develope an interest in playing games outside. While young children are developing motor skills teens and adults are reasearching. Many teens use the internet as reasource, I know I do. Teens often must do reports for multiple classes. Not many students have the time to go to the also they are reasearching or. We are often being with sports, younger siblings or but the internet is! Most teens prefer the orignal program will. They find @CAPS2 and you can buy many online now. This saves, to power machines to the. The human millions calling down to which. We could of their. Humans @CAPS3 and the internet will help the. The internet also allows people to talk to one another. This allows people to share pictures, opinions and assignments. Many adult like @NUM1 share pictures of when they were younger with friends and family. By converting pixels into @CAPS4 you can e-mail, @CAPS5 @CAPS6 or share via so web-page. Opinions are also shared. Many people have discussions over issues they feel are pressing, such as the rain forest or fossil fuels. Many people pursuade others this way, or form groups about this concern. Teens also use the internet for school work. If student forgets some thing they can ask a friend to fax @CAPS2 over or remind them what page the assignment was on. This is very helpful because if prevents failing grades and bad report cards. I hope my letter has informed you about the many ways computers are helpful. They teach hand-eye coordination, help us learn about the world around us, and allow people to talk about important issues.",10
2014,"Dear, to whom it @MONTH1 concern I have @NUM1 different but similar opinion on how computers can effect people. One opinion is that they can help you trying to find things on the computer. Second reason is because you can enhance your hand-eye cordination and my last reason is that you can learn new thinks by playing educational games. My reason us that they can help you find thing that you and not know about and they can help you because if you have a biography report you have to do for school and they dont have a book on that person you can look it upon the computer the give you so many sorces to choose from but if you did the book only gives you one resource to choose from. My second reason for how computers effect people is that it gives them hand eye cordination which you really need in anyway which can help uou later in hand eye cordination is a great reason is become you will be able to computer same time. My last reason how computer effect people is that they can off how to get know it there website were you are such in subject our doing help you grom so that you can become better and get good grades on test. In conclusion I think that computers have a great effect on people from the reasons listed above which were help you learn something secondly enhane hand eye cordination and to get a better education. I hope this help you alot and you agreed to it",7
2015,"Dear @PERSON1 @CAPS1, In the computer beneficial controversy I am standing @CAPS2 computer. People of all ages use these machines. The majorally for reasons benefiting them many very from kids just old enough to read to the just forgeting new. Many parents wonder nowadays whether sites should be enough to let their socialize and civilice on them. But the majority of childrens sites and cd-rom games are their young minds to adapt early to a world filled with knowledge and learning. Childen can learn oh so another reason to be @CAPS2-computers is because people of any age cn hop on the old internet and a journey of learning ! New people, new culture, anything like. a moments passing you could have all the information you could went at your fingertips. Who could ever think to try to live without their social networking site? Sites such as facebook, myspace, @MONTH1 have their down falls but they are great texts for connecting distant. former class co-workers even catching up with old friends. So before you think about putting computers consider the good also. There is so much more. Thank you.",7
2016,"Dear local Newspaper, Computers have a possitive effect on people. Firstly, you learn new information using the @CAPS1. @CAPS12, you can use the computer to communicate with other people. Finally, you usually find work using a computer. First of all computers have a positive effect on people because people can use the computer to learn new information. Firstly, there are web sites on the computer that post informative articles on the @CAPS1. @CAPS7 you want to learn something new about the world or just about anything else you can look on the computer. @CAPS12, @CAPS7 you are looking for information for just one subject, you can easily find that too. For examples, a web site like @CAPS2 @CAPS3 just has you type in a subject and it finds articles about it for you. Lastly you can probably learn something by just searching on the web. Professor @PERSON1 of @CAPS4 @CAPS1 @CAPS6 says, ""@CAPS7 you spend just five minutes looking through the @CAPS1 chances are you will learn something new."" Computers have a possitive effect on peope beacuse they can learn new information. @CAPS12, computers have a possitive effect on people because you can use the computer to communicate with other people. Firstly, you can be in a @CAPS10 room with anyone around the world in one of these @CAPS10 @CAPS11. Doctor @PERSON2 of @CAPS8 @CAPS1 use of @CAPS10 @CAPS11 says ""oproximatly one million people from all around the world log on to @CAPS10 @CAPS11 everyday to talk to other people."" @CAPS12, you can use the computer to write a letter or type literature. For example, you are writing an important letter to your friend, but your pen or pencil break. You can type it on the computer instead. Lastly, @CAPS7 you have something important (anything) and you want share it with the world, all you have to do is use the computer to make a web site. In a resent study on overage every web site on the @CAPS1 is viewed at least twice a day, many people are bounded to see your web site. Lastly, computer have a possitive effect on people because you can easily find work using a separate. Firstly, you can find job lists or companies offering jobs on the computer. For example you just got fired from a job its not for bad because you can just find another job online. @CAPS12, some people get paid by typing or posting things on the computer. in a recent study @PERCENT1 of jobs today involve working on a computer. Lastly, you can stay a home while you work on the computer. Learning new information on the computer, communicating through the computer, and using the computer to find work are all reasons why computer have a possitive effect on people. Millions of people use the computer everyday, would you, the local newspaper, want to tell them it is not good for them?",11
2017,"Dear @CAPS1, (Local Newspaper) I believe that computers have far more negative effects on people than their positive effects. One major problem w/ computers is that they could make their users spend less time w/ family. Also, they could arise in an addiction, ( to the comp.) @CAPS2, there are quite more ""productive"" things to do instead of being on the computer. Family is a very important factor in life, along w/ friends. We all need family & friends to spend time with. The time we spend w/ family & friends should be thought of as precious because they won't always be around. So, why waste this time on the computer when it could be spent w/ the ones you love? When you go on the comp. for a while your friends & family are probably missing hanging out w/ you or just having you there. My mother only allows me to go on the computer for @NUM1 hour, at most, each day. She says that is so I can spend time w/ herself & my family. She is right because we only have them for so long so we should use that to our advantage. This leads me into my next topic. An addiction is something that you live, breathe & can't live w/o. Usually addictions are bad. An addiction that is getting worse in people throughout the years is a computer addiction. @CAPS3. @PERSON1 says ""A recent study shows the @PERCENT1 of teens spend more than @NUM2 hours a day on the computer & of that, @PERCENT2 were just recently diagnosed w/ an addiction. This is bad, real bad."" @CAPS3 @PERSON1 is right. This is real bad. It needs to be stopped. I talked to a counciler the other day. She has about @NUM3 different people came to her a month & about @NUM4 of them are computer addicts! It @MONTH1 not seem like alot now, but @CAPS4 we don't stop this than soon the numbers & statistics will get out of control. Now, nobody wants that, do they? Also, being on the comp. far too long could result in eyesight problems, because you are staring @ the screen too long. To stop the rapidly increasing numbers of people who spend too much time on the computer we need to influence the people positively w/ healthier things to do. There are many other ""healthy alternatives"" to computers. You could go & exercise, or just hang w/ friends. My mom said to me once ""@CAPS4 you do healthier things now, it will definately help you in the long run."" I know it @MONTH1 sound dumb to kids, but it is true. Comps. also have an unhealthy influnce on kids because of the internet. Many things are innapproiate for young users, but they are not blocked. For example! AIM, people can say anything. Sure comps. are of great convinence, but life is not about convinence all the time. We need to relize that people could be spending more time w/ family + friends, we could have less addicts & that there are healthier alternatives to computers. So please would you help. We need to make this world a better place, this is a small step.",11
2019,"Dear newspaper writer's, I think that computer's are not so bad. I think the time you should use a computer is in the @DATE1 and be outside in the @DATE2. Computer's are good because you can learn many things about different country's diffent equipment and technology and about the kind. You also can stay in contact with all you friends, send pictures and letter's to your friend's that live in different countrie's and state's. They could also help with your school work and projects. The outdoor's is very important to people. You need to get fresh air and get excercise. You need to stay active to stay healthy. Nobody like's sitting in the house all day. That is no fun. People should play an hour a day. I really don't see why people wouldn't want to, it is fun to be outside. People need computers though. It help's with there work, balancing money and putting information on it. It also help's with organizing their week like planner. It can tell people time day of the month and people in their life. Computer's are very handy to daily life and work. That is why computer's are important to every day life but make sure you get some fresh air and computer's are helpful to society.",7
2020,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 is an argument going around debating whether computers benefit society, or whether they will destiny it. I think that computers have a negative and a positive side and shouldnt @CAPS2 people need to learn to divide @CAPS1 time so that they can excersize and use the computer in moderation. The @CAPS3 to having a computer one being that people will be able to talk with friends & family that do not live close to you. This would be a pro, or positive point, because if one were to completely stop communication over the internet some families will have no way to talk to one another. @CAPS2 if someone had a friend in @LOCATION2 and were suddenly forced to move to @LOCATION1 people would have a difficult time comminucating through because @LOCATION1 is @NUM1 hours behind so when it is @NUM1 oclock @CAPS4 @CAPS1, here it is @NUM3 oclock so most kids would be in school. Another pro would be that a lot of learning for children, the computer whether it be in of all of school. For example I have a @NUM4 year old cousin and she learns the alphabet and much @CAPS1 so the computer such as math, and some language were to stop using computers in one community of children will not be as The would be computers increase hand eye coordination. For example when children are brought to the want to teach hand-eye coordination and linked their babys that learning will be better at sports. The cons, or negative points, would be one is people are spending to much time on the computer and not excersizing. And a survey was taken at an obeisity clinic and @PERCENT1 of these people stated that when they should've been excersizing they were on the computer. Second is that families that live together are spending time on the computer instead of spending time together, this is destroying some families and even some friendships. People need to learn that computers have their pros and their cons. And that a person can't live their life on the computer or, in other words, computer's are good and bad. People just need to learn how to use them in moderation with everything society (outside of the computer) in their life.",8
2021,"Dear editor: I am writing on behalf of my fellow students as well as teachers. Once you finish reading this letter, I am confident you will agree that having computers can be a serious benefit. Three reasons I say this areas follows: increased work productivity, easier reasearch, and more learning within a household. My first reason for writing you is that on in home computer can increase work productivity. I remember a time when I had to write and I just could not get started. So I asked my mom if I could do it on the computer, and e-mail it to my teacher. She said yes and I worked on the paper using microsoft word. To make a long story short, I finished the paper in @NUM1 hour. So as you can see from my example, having a computer increases work productivity in most people. The second reason that having an in home computer is a benefit if easier research. Reasearch can be extremely hard when you work at a library. But with a computer, you can find information in a few minutes that would take hours to find at a library. Also the internet has no weight, so you could carry books worth of information in your laptop as it would never get any heavier. Also, the internet will exist as long as there are computers to access it, a will and rot. So as you can see, reasearch the computer can be a breeze. The third reason having a computer is helpful is that it can increase the pace at learning. Learning can be increased when information and work are official statistics of people learn faster a computer. So as it is clear to me as it probably is to you, having a computer can make learning easier. I hope how I have convinced you that owning a computer is a huge benefit.",8
2022,"I believe that the effects computers have on people is bad. One reason is that if you spend too much time on a computer you could have a bad posture from leaning over. Next, the computer keeps people from going outside and getting exercise. Lastly, the computer keeps people from doing things they need to do. You could have a bad posture from leaning over too much. When you are on a computer you want to be as close to it as you can, so you would hunch over to get a better view. When you are typing you would lean to see what you are writing. If you are on the computer hunched over too much it would become a habbit to always lean over, especialy when you walk. The computer can keep people from getting exercise and going outside. most children would go on the computer when they get home, instead of going outside to play. The computer has so many things to do or it wich temps children to go on all the time. It is one of the main causes that a large percentage of kids are overweight in the @LOCATION1. The computer keeps people from doing necessary things they need to do. A lot of kids will not do their homework because of the exercise time spent on the computer. People procrastinate either communicating with friends, playing a game or even shopping online wich is a major factor from doing important things. If there was no computer people would not be as tempted, therfore they would get on with their life and complete things that have to get done. The computer has a bad and unecessary effect on people. it gives people a bad posture keeps them from getting exercise and going outside. It also keeps people from doing things they to do. The computer is one of the main forters in children and also adults being overweight. Therfore the computer has bad impacts on people in society.",8
2023,"Computers are one of the most popular electronics; they can almost do anything! And along with that they also have a positive effect on people. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places, allow people to talk online, and even teach hand-eye coordination. They must affect people in a positive way considering everything they can do for us! When money's tight, and you don't have the time to travel. Where do you go to learn about new, but far away places? Most would go to the library, but why go when you could easily find articles within seconds rather than scan books for hours? The internet on the computer provides researches with millions of resources-much more than most libraries. Without lifting a finger, but instead a few clicks of a mouse you can find reliable articles and photographs from scientbists; or even basic description of areas from hotels. In other words, you can practically travel while staying in your computer seat! The ability to learn about far away places is enhanced in many ways just by logging on to the computer, which definitely has a positive effect on people. The computer isn't justb convenient for learning but also for talking! Overtime, many instant messaging systems have been created and risen to extreme fame, making it easy to stay in touch with old friend and distant relatives, its fast, and rather than burn up minnutes on a telephone, typing into most chatting programs is free. In addition, you can send files of any kind-music, pictures, documents-allowing computer users to get critical feedback on their work, or sharing interesting things in a way much more easily done than the telephone. Chating get the computer is just another way the computer has a positive on people. Lastly, yet interesting enough the computer touches hand-eye coordination. The actual holding of the mouse and the interaction with the observing of it on-screen benefits hand-eye coordination. Obviously this can help athletes (eith the night programming of course), but also ordinary people, our hands and eyes interact with almost every movement we make, so why deny the chance to improve? Computers not only have a positive effect on people, but more specifically their hand-eye coordination, too. The effect computers have on people has been under observation for years now, but despite the pessimistic opinions of others, it certainly does have a positive effect. COmputers are machines that, along with helping us learn, talk, and with hand-eye coordination, have a positive effect on people. They truly benefit us in more ways than we can count.",11
2024,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 the controversy over wehther computers have a negative or positive affect on society heats up, I feel the need to express my well thought out opinion to enlighten the public. There is no doubt in my mind that this rapidly growing technology can make the entire @CAPS6 a better place. Utilizing access to the internet opens a whole new door of possibilities reading the quest for knowledge. Perhaps even more importantly, online programs such @CAPS3 @CAPS4, email, and @CAPS5 can using friends closer together strengthing there companionship so that it lasts a lifetime. Finally, the best part about computers is that they make the @CAPS6 smaller in theory, so that a conversation with your mom in @LOCATION1 is one click away. Although few people will admit it, the thirst for knowledge is one of the strongest human instincts and it shall never be quenched. Thanks to computers, it doesn't have to be. What would have taken of reading and searching to find a single answer a century ago, can now be done with the click a mouse on google. Knowing too much can never be a bad thing. I'm not that every person who has used used a computer is smarter than someone who hasn't, but I will say that proper utilization of this technology drastically increases the actual potential to learn. One of the classic arguements of someone who is anti-computers is that it diminishs your social life dramiticly. On the contrary, the social life of someone who often uses the computer is almost always going to be more prosperous. Online you can chat with friends about whatever you want. You can even chat with a group multiplying your friends, and since when is having to many friends a bad thing. Not only will you meet and make new friends, but these technological advancements will even furthur strengthen the that you share with your best friends, expanding the life span of these friendships to after college. When you have internet, there is no such thing @CAPS3 long-distance relationships because everybodies a click away. The @CAPS6 @CAPS7 web does just what the name implies. I connects the whole planet bringing families and cultures closer together. Just the other day I watched @CAPS3 a friend of mine with his grandmother in @ORGANIZATION1 through a video chat. Family members that would otherwise never meet are coming together thanks to computers. Cultures are also spreading around the @CAPS6 because of this advancement. Now that there are computers, the @CAPS6 is shrinking to a comfortable and convienient size. Computers will change not millions, but billions of lives for the better. Human beings will continue to develop stronger bads with fellow people @CAPS3 the @CAPS6 gets smaller. Having to really search to gain knowledge will be a thing in the past. Technology is the key to making our @CAPS6 a better place.",10
2025,"Dear local Newspaper, I also support advances in technology and belive that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers help keep people @CAPS6 to date on the local @CAPS11 and/or weather alerts. They also let people from any place at any time commnicate. Finally a computer also has many cool apps at your disposale. I dont know about you but my parents never know whats happening in the world or even in their own town. When they got a computer it allowed them to learn about the latest @CAPS11 whenever they want. They learned about new things @CAPS1 @PERSON2 is doing to help the @LOCATION2. They also learned that @LOCATION1 won the gold medal in hockey @CAPS3 the @DATE1 winter olympics. Finally they were updated that a big storm was coming and to stay indoors. Thank goodness @CAPS3 that. Other people can learn new things about the world and more like communicating with friends. Did I say friends? I ment to say that a computer can also let you talk online with friends, family and just about anybody else who owns a computer. @CAPS3 people who dont have a home phone and can't afford a cell phone you can talk on the computer. Whether it be by email or I.m. Talking about I.ming if you have some urgent information that you have to tell someone immedetly then you can just @CAPS2 people. (@CAPS3 you older folks out there I.m means instant messeging.) @CAPS4 course anybody can make an email address as well and just talk to people using that too! A computer is a great way to communiate, learn, and it has lots @CAPS4 cool stuff to use. It's true a computer does have lots @CAPS4 cool and suprising tools or apps @CAPS3 you to use. A piece @CAPS4 software called ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"" is easy to use and nice to have. ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"" allows you to build and design houses, buildings and just about anything @NUM1-@CAPS9 online. I think thats awsome. We cant forget the magnifisent internet. One @CAPS4 the best inventions @CAPS4 man kind. The internet lets people look @CAPS6 anything from dinosaurs to the revelotionary war to @PERSON1. The interent is a place where you can learn stuff, teach stuff, post stuff and more! A computer has very complex things like @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and the internet but it also has simple accessories too. Like a calculator, a clock or even a virtual sticky note pad to write (I mean type) notes on. So dear local newspaper, thanks @CAPS3 taking the time to read my letter and understand that a computer teaches people a lot through the internet, allows people to talk to there friends whenever they want and finally it keeps people like my parents @CAPS6 to date on the @CAPS11 @CAPS4 the world. P.S. @CAPS4 course a computer will never get the cool, importat @CAPS11 that you local newspaper do!",9
2026,"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I beleive that computers have a positive effect on society. By using a computer you are able to improve your hand eye coordination, give others helpful information about far away people + places, you also are able to talk online @NUM1, send others pic, documents, videos, or just post them on a webpage. I think that computers are vital when it comes to improving our nation. Did you know that computers can offer rehab or just extra help for those in need. By using a computer you are able to improve your hand eye coordiation, or play learing games. Using a computer you are able to improve your hand eye coordiation because in order to click on things you must look at the button with your eyes and click on it with your hand. @CAPS6 is also computer softwares available that helps people learn. By using a computer we are capable of learning things about far away people and places. This is very useful because it enables people to become educated no matter where you are in the world. Using a computer does not cost much if you do not own one. Enyone can go for free. This is very helpful. By using a computer you are esily able to share your pic, documents, and videos. It is as easy as as few simple clicks, you can privatly send mesages to your friends using @CAPS3 or e-mail. OR you could post them on @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 sites. This is very useful in the fact that if you ever needed to reach someone in case of emergency you would be able to. Because of all of these reasons and more saying that computers are nessisary in the sense taht they are helpful, useful, and can improve our society for the better. Even though computers are wonderful you should always exercize everyday no matter what. USE COMPUTERS - @CAPS6 @CAPS7!",8
2027,Dear @CAPS1 I think that computers are good for this world because it lets people talk to other people around the world and to do important work. Another reason is that you can learn faraway places and you could learn about famous people and how they live and what they do for a living. If you need to do a project just go on a computer and look up what ever you need t due you project. If your bord and there nothing to do you could go and play some games or look up stuff. I know that computer can upset people because all of that technology and that computer playing video game and talking to friends then speding time outside and playing games outside and to explore nature.,6
2028,Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 opinion on the effects computers have on other people are that... Well it's true that a lot of people do spend to much time on the computer but is that neceserily a realy bad thing. For instance what if you're in college and you have to write or type like a @NUM1 page essay on @LOCATION1. You hardly know anything on @LOCATION1. You have to spend most of the day on the computer researching about @LOCATION1 and it's history and typing it down. Do you think thats a wast of time don't you want to pass and have to redo the class agian. I know some other people don't use there computers like. Others use there computers to talk to people online. Like on myspace or facebook you might think thats a wast of time too but what if your walking around your town one day and see someone you were talking to on myspace your intrdouce yourself and then you guys become friends. What i'm trying say is computers aren't that bad.,6
2029,"The world is slowly becoming smaller and smaller. Not litteraly of course instead people are given the oportunity to learn, communicate and study other cultures. @CAPS2 would not be able to do this without computers. Computers help people because they teach hand-eye coordination, they give people the chance to learn and comunicate with foreign cultures, and they help the world technoligicly progess. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. This is an extremely important skill to have in today's world. @CAPS2 must be able to type fast and precise to suceed from day to day. Afterall who wants an unifitiont, un-coordinated person as their buisness partner. Every time I go to school I realize something new has been upgraded or made technological, and us @NUM1 graders are expected to be able to figure out programs. Not only do computers help @CAPS1 succeed, it also helps children in poor countries to comunicate with the outside world. Computers help mankind because it gives children and adults rich or poor to communicate with other cultures. By doing this @CAPS2 are opening up whole to paths for every day children to branch out and find a productive career. It also teaches kids to be tolerant of diffrent ethnicities at an early age. Some people might say that computers are bad because they expose children to violence and poverty in other countries. However is that really a bad thing? All children eventually learn that there is more to life then their town so why is it bad to teach kids to be aware of dangers at a young age. A wise man once said, ""@CAPS2 have history @CAPS2 don't repeat ourselves"". Well that is exactly what @CAPS2 would be doing if @CAPS2 stop using computers. people would stay in their own town have no usterstanding of the outside world and live a mediocre life. is that the life you would want to be living? Computers take us for and beyond the limitations of man kind and they will stay that way. The future is now. It is time for exploration and advancement. Computers make this possible by giving people opportunities to advance, etc mans are born to suceed, so why settle for any thing less? ",9
2030,"Dear local Newspaper, I am writting to persuade you to belive that computes are good to have. Three reasons are they are helpfull. They are fun and they are good for people. First of all they are very helpfull. They are mhelpfull because you can learn about different places. For example you can learn about @CAPS1 earthquake if you don't have t.v. You can learn about @CAPS2 and what to do to help if you want. Another example, is that you can learn about people in far away places. For example, you can learn why people in africa there faces and put bones through there noses or lips. My last example is that it helps us under stand anything we want. For example you can learn how to do malgebra, or how to make . You can understand anything you won't if you go on a computer. Secondly, they are really fun. They are fun because you can play all sorts of games. For example you can play games mean games, games that suites you, you can even create. Another reason they are fun is that you can talk to people can by twitter. E-mail, aim, myspace, facebook and many different other ways. My last examples is that you can download and even print pictures. You can print pictures of any thing. For example you can print pictures or your best friend movie , animals and more things. Thirdly, computers can be good for you. They can be good for you by you can meet new people, you can get a new boyfriend, you can make new friends. For example if you are looking for a new boy friend or girl friend you can go on e-harmony. Lets date.com and many different websites. Another example uis that if you to promote your company or buisnes you can craete your own website. For example, my neighbor created a website for his buisness and now he is putting more buildings up all around the world. My last reason is that you ca skype this is good for you because if you have a family member that lives faraway you can use a skype can era to talk to each other even though you really far away. Those are my @NUM1 reasons why computers are good they can help, they are good, and they are fun.",8
2031,"Dear computer technology I think computers have a positive effect on people because computers tell you information that you need. Computers are good because it gives tips on which you wanna learn about. Also two years ago @PERSON1 a member of the computer company said, about @NUM1 people liked computers. People like computers because there's cool stuff that you can look at on the computer like sports, the wild, and the ocean. Also on the computer you can find out stuff that you didn't no about like what is happening right no which is earthquakes. People should use computers because if you are going vacation and you are going to @LOCATION1 and you don't no were your going you might can go on the computer and look it up on google or yahoo and they show you a map of were you wanna go to. Also you can see were to get a map the computer might show if print the map out on the computer or the computer might were you can get a map. Computers are good for you because if you wanna buy something and you don't kmow how much it cost the computer might how much it cost and were you can buy them at, you might a pear of sneakers, a jacket, a hat, a watch, a chain, or a couple shirts. People should use computers because if your in highschool or college and you need to get a job you can go on the computer and try an look for a job you might wonna go to the mall and work there the computer might show how hours you have to work if they higher you the job. But before they higher you to their job you need to show them that you are right for the job and you can show them that by coming to work on time and working very hard. People should buy computers. Computers cost a lot of money but they are worth it because you can do all kinds of things on the computer. On the computer you can look up basketball games and football games. Also you can look of stuff about animals if you want.",8
2032,"Imagine a world where there are both children and adults that are addicted to technology, especially computers, I heard some people talking about the wonders of computers and what they have done to @LOCATION2. @CAPS2, others think tha't computers are affecting peoples health, how social they are towards others, and there is any too much information about people. The effects of what technology (Computers) has done far out weighs the good or them. American's health rate has been dropping recntly due to obesity and computers are difenalely causin this tragic formality. Computers have formed people into homebodies that like to get information off of the computer that doesn't include themselves and they seen to be exersising less and less. This will cause @LOCATION1 great embarisment because even though @LOCATION1 is talented in technology. Americans will be sitting on the computers all day. Obviously, computers are affecting the health of people and they need to become more active. From experience, I known that computers are addicting and that the more you are on them the more you want to go back on them. Computers are causing a social gap in the @DATE1. This is because people are now communicating from facebook, twitter, ichat, instant messaging, and emails. People are ruining their relatioship's with others and aren't spending enough time with their families (Which soon could lead to anxiety, stress, and bad gradis). Computers are ruining relatioships that they have with their family and friends, @CAPS1 time, you are brainwashed with the wonders of the computers but you don't realize the effects of them. You @MONTH1 think that computers are greay because they have improved the information we are recieving, @CAPS2, sometimes too much information can be harmful. Google is a site with tons of information about people. This way, @CAPS3 and people that could hurt you easily could find where you are with the information the computers their have them liven information opens minds, too much information could lead you into trouble. Obviously, computers are harming the @LOCATION2 because they are causing bad health, Their rvining relationships, and they are giving out too much information. The effects of computers have far what they have done for us. What would you rather do?",10
2033,"I support advances in technology fully. There are many enriching benefits that come from technology at our fingertips. As we all are witnessing, our nation, our world, are becoming more and more technologically advanced every day. Though some people believe computers take away from social interaction, they are the complete apposite and actually increase social interactions shouldn't you be proud that our work is advancing? I am. If you were born in the ninety's; eightie's even, you have been around computers or known of them, your whole life. We started off typing and playing games at the age of @NUM1, maybe even younger. And since then, computers/technology have become a big part of most of our lives. There are so many amzing things that you can do with technology, research, listen to music, play video games, have a blogs and much more, with we have a more advanced society. Nowadays if we forgot a school book at school, we can acces it online. Printer isn't working? E-mail. Relatives can't make it for thanksgiving? Videocalls. Technology provides many solutions to everyday obstacle. Where be without it? The growth and well being of our world depends on the growth of technology. Hospitals provide to everyone; new born young, teens and the hospitals are full of computers. Schools contain many devices and computers to ensure a safe and rich education. Some computers even give people the ability to talk. The advances are beneficial to the public and has many benefits to our society. Facebook is a booming online blog collection that is over-flowing with members. Mostly every teen has one and I, myself do too. Facebook is a place where it's possible to share pictures, videos, news and much more. It allows you to interact with people on the whole other side of the world and stay ""caught up"" with old friends, family and even people you haven't talked to for years. And facebook isn't the only example of online interaction, there are many more. Yes, some people could spend a little less time online, but you can't blame technology for people's laziness. As you can inquire from reading this, isn't technology a wonderful thing? It's at its peak of popularity and quality. And everyone is benefitting from it. Our nation depends on it. And our youth rely on it socially. Will you be the one to pull it down?",10
2034,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion on computers effect on people is positive, computers benefit people in many different ways because they cam teach people so many things and they are able to retreive basically any information you are looking for. In fact, a local citizen quoted, ""I love going online because I know @CAPS5's where I can find all @CAPS2 information and I can @CAPS4 rely on @CAPS5."" I do agree with her, @CAPS3 has been stated, I deeply believe that computers have a positive effect on people because they teach you hand-eye coordination, give people an opputunity to learn about far away places, and lastly, they allow people to chat online with friends or family. @CAPS3 i said before, a benefit from computers would be, hand-eye coordination. During elementary school students are taught how to type on keyboards by not looking at their hands and only the screen; therefore, students will be able to type much faster. Hand-eye coordination and being able to type fast will definitely benefit students @CAPS3 they grew older and begin to type long essays or however   @CAPS4, now a days computers are used to   choices so being able to have hand-eye coordination will come in . So, not moving hand-eye coordination skills will not benefit you. Another way computer helps positive    they give people oppurtunity to about that for. You have the power to type in any place in the world of the computer will give you maps, images, videos and links.I personally have used the computer  or countries for school purposes and  gotten a good grade. If @CAPS5 is aren't for computer, does this people who'd be half   about. Lastly, I strongly suppport the usage @CAPS3  bestfriend @PERSON1 moved to iceland a little while ago and since I cannot text her anymore or call that easily, the computer gives me a chance to stay in touch with her by instant message, video, or email. The computer is a very important technologic device to many people. A young boy stated. ""I use video chat online to reach @CAPS2 father who is currently in @LOCATION1 for buisness, @CAPS5 is the ony way i talk to him."" This advantage in computers benefits so many people in all the same way, communication. To conclude, I strongly agree those who advance in thecnology. Computers are very imporant to our society, they help us teach hand-eye coordination, teach is about far away places, and give us ability to communicate with friends or family. I demand, you stand with me on @CAPS2 opinion about the positive effect  computers have on people",9
2035,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 technology has been and will continue to grow very quickly. Computers are a very important aspect in peoples lives. Computers are very important for many reasons, computers create jobs for people, teach people various skills, and provide @CAPS3 intellegance. Computers technology is very much needed in our society. Even in todays economy, computers can give many people jobs based on their skills. According to a professor at @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 work online or have received a job from a @CAPS1. If you are out of work and need to find a job you can type what job you are looking for and @PERCENT2 of the time you will a job you like. Computers are full of information on a almost everything there is to know. Computers are great teachers for various things, for example computers can help you train for your job or teach you how to cook a meal. According to @PERSON1, a father who works from home ""every afternoon I go on the @CAPS1 and find a new recipe to cook for dinner. The @CAPS1 is a life saver."" @CAPS3 inteligance is very important especially today. Without our modern day @CAPS1 technology, we would probably not be able to win any futer war. If a @ORGANIZATION3 agent go's into @LOCATION2 and finds important information they can e-mail the information back the their headquarters rather than writing a letter on paper were the letter might not make it or someone could intercept the letter. @CAPS1 technology is very important for these reasons: they provide people with jobs, they teach people various skills, and they provide the @CAPS3 with inteligance. So post a front page article on why modern day @CAPS1 technology is so important in our society. If you do so, more people will read you paper and you will gain respect from you piers and your newspaper will be the most popular newspaper in @LOCATION1.",9
2036,"Dear Newspaper, I support the groth of technology. The advances and useage of todays tech and gagets. It make sociaty run smoother and makes everyday lives better and easier. These are my three reasons why: it makes us smarter, we can easally communicate with friends and fammily, and just makes our lives easier. Things like computers make us smarter, reading news articals, lurning @CAPS1 things from videos make us smarter every day. There is a lot we can learn from the internet. Say you go on your homepage and see a news artical called ""@CAPS1 dinosor discovered in @LOCATION1, sounds interesting right? You click on it to read the full artical and you learn something @CAPS1. There is stuff like that all over the internet. Technology also helps us communicate with cellphones and instant messaging we can chat whenever we want. There is messaging over the internet with video chat and chat rooms. If I need to remind my friend i'll just shoot him a text. Communicating has become so much easier because of todays technology. Without a dout, computers make every day life easier. If I need to find a artical and write a report on it I'll use technology. I won't have to find an artical in the newspaper and write it down on paper. I could look up can artical on the internet and type my paper on microsoft word. I hope that my letter has convinced you that groth in technology is good because it makes us smarter, make communicating easy and makes our lives better.",8
2037,"Dear @CAPS1, I have resently read from the town newspaper in @LOCATION1 that same people is arguing if we should have computer or not have computer. As I had descover this new interesting facts, I went around the town of @ORGANIZATION1, surveying teens and adults of what they had think about this. About @PERCENT1 of the people in @CAPS2 agreed that we should keep computers and that it's a good thing. I also believe that having computer is a great idea. My first reason is that computer is a good way to teach hand eye coordination. Most people are slow are typing. So using the computer helps typing skills and it would help people when plays the piano teach a certain keys. Computers could also teach hand-eye cordination start out by exercising your finger. This is one whay how computers are good to have. My second reason is that the computers give people the ability to learn about faraway place and people. This is a good way why we should computers because then kids from school could go online to search up information about a person, places or thing for a certain project. So computer also help kids education through web. Also, many people then could able to find their long lost family's history online. This is my second reason why we should keep computer and new they're good for you. My third reason is that the computers allow people to talk online with other people. Some experts think having computer less time to interest with familys and friends. But in this case, computers helps you to comunication with alot of your friend and familys online especially long distance familys and friends. Also it helps people make new friends through chat or online pages. This is my third reason why we should keep computers and how they're good for you. In conclusion, I believe having computer is good for you and that it's a great idea. I believe this because computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and peoples, and even allow people to talk online with other people. I recommend you to allow people use the computers. This importants desicion is up to you.",9
2038,"Have you ever needed help with something and you used your computer to find the answer. Well that the computer has many benefits to offer. The computer teached you hand-eye coordination. Also people are able to learn about faraway places without actually going to the places, in addition people are now able to other people in faraway places. Now-a-days some people are not able to talk. However technology has found a solution. People would now be able to talk by just looking at the screen. If they look at the screen, the screen will read the persons eyes and transfer what they need to say, on to the screen. It really helps people in need. One day I had to do a report on another country. So I went to my computer to learn about the country. It's a lot easier than going to visit the country. Also the computer is a good way country if you want to go there. You could learn what they eat, drink, and even @CAPS1 knows what a web cam is. Well now computers are made with built-in web cams. Web cams allow you to talk to in faraway places. It really comes in handy. Computer are also a great way of meeting people. They can see how you live while, you can see how they live. So I am for the idea of the benefits of computers. They could teach you about other things. You could learn about a faraway place. As well as talking to people in faraway places. The computer really comes in very handy.",8
2039,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 on more and more people have been using computers. Good or bad? Well that’s why I'm here to give my opinion on the effects computers have on people. People that beileve this is a good idea agree on getting smarter, learn about faraway places and people, and also hand-eye coordination. But others disagree, and are concerned about being healthy, cyber bullying, and less time with friends, family's, and less time with nature. Their are many different ideas. Cyber bullying has been a problem @CAPS1 on. It has been going on for years. More and more kids have been caused in this incedent. There has been many incedent's over the internet. We a need a safe internet. By helping that is to spend less time on the internet. For an example less exercising. Many people are more worried about that which is a bad case. Being healthy and being in that right fit is good. We don't want more and more people using computers, and having to worry about weight, and being heathly. Experts dont wanna have to worry about that. On the other hand, computers are very technique. I beilive that the ability that computers can have on people, or the positive effect. Some good examples are talking to others online, learning about faraway places and people, and hand-eye coordiantion. But too much computer can have a negetive effect. I believe that people are spending too much time on computers, not good. Leads to many bad causes. For an example less time being down to earth, helping the world and less time with exploring nature. But most important being with family and friends. I hope you believe my opinion on the effect on computer. Because I do believe too much time with it can be bad for people. But I think spending a little time not to much is fine. But people want to be heathly, more active, and less cyber bullying. Thank you and hope you take my word for it.",8
2040,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 had been a great help to one seens it was invented. Their are ways that @CAPS1 effect every one, just like what the @CAPS1 experts people said computers are very greatful, fun and enjoyable but it just had for your healthy. I believe that people should stop spending so much time on @CAPS1 because its bad in many reasons like, too much taxes bills debts, exercise and family matters. @CAPS1 is bad for you as too much taxes because you waste so much on electricity and the more you get bills the higher the taxes goes. It depends on how rich or poor you are. If you don't have jobs and you are on @CAPS1 all day not finding jobs doing some none seens work it would effect your life. It would be on debts and that would be very hard to get them paid if you don't have jobs and money. It is important to have money and stop espending time on @CAPS1. Exercise is what people need during the time that you gain weight because seating all day eating food and no nutritions you would get obis which is too fat. No one would like that kind of situation in your young age. It is good to exercise sometimes if you have a break and get your muscle going than typing, searching and emaling with friends. I don't want to be mean for those people who just love seatng and doing no exercise. Family is one tough thing to do if you get in a fight for not caring them and not even thinking about them. Spending as much time as you can on family matters because you could talk, laugh and enjoy the day than your @CAPS1. Invite friends and your family to came together just for fun and you could learn a lot from them than yourself. Family is the one you would always have no matter what happend because you could protect each other on your worries and enjoy your life. @CAPS1 doesn't help much if you have worries because you imailed them but it would take a lot of time because they might not be checking their mail all the time. Family helps a lot on your problem, teamwork and spend time with your children. You could go to park with your family and enjoy the fresh air you would always remember in your life. The @CAPS1 would damage your school work if your a student because you would not get everything done and the next day you failed on your test or exam. Bad for students to not get a good and don't stay late children and specially with adults and to get a good night sleep everyday for at least @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours a day to work your brain on the next day. Save a lot of energy would help you than @CAPS1. @CAPS1 don't go to sleep because their technology than you do. Like some experts say that spending too much time on their computers would meant less time exercising, enjoying nature around you and interacting with family and friends. I would like everyone to get a good night sleep and just spend computers a little slowly that staying late. Spend less if you can for your own good health!",9
2041,"Why would it be a bad thing to use computers? It's not, people need computers for many different things. So, no people do not spend to much time on the computer because, they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and even allow people to talk online. Using computers teach hand-eye coordination. By playing games on the computer people learn how to react to something faster, than they would if they didn't have computers. Also, if people use computer at a young age they will know how to use it better and be able to get good jobs. Because if they know how to type then they will be able to type faster when they get older and type words a minute, that will led to good things later in there life. Another way the computer teaches hand-eye coordination is that when your taking test you wont skip a problem be misstake and get every problem form than on wrong. Computers teach use about faraway places. Think how hard it would be it if you had to o a school report on it and you did not have a computer. It would pretty hard. Or what if your planning a family vacation and you don't just went to go up to @LOCATION1 for the. What do you use to find a good place to travel to? The computer thats where! Or you know when you going, but not really wants there, the computer helps you in so many ways. Computers allow people to talk to one another online. This is good because for project at works at work people need to talk to one other because they need to know what they are doing wrong or right. School project, the kids need to know what they are doing and need to know where and when to meet. Or maybe someones baseball game got cancelled and one person doesn't know, so they other person tells him online instead of tieing up the phone lines. Maybe after a long day of school a kid just wants to talk to his friend and releaxe. So, using computers is not a bad thing because, they teach hand-eye coordination and allow people to talk to one another online. Having a computer is not a bad thing. Just do not over use it, and you will be fine.",8
2042,"Since the dawn of humanity, people have argued over the implementation of technology. Some argue that modern technology, i.e, computers, retract from our core values. I am not one of them. Computer, offer incredible converiance to their users, teach valuable real world skills, and link the world together in ways that were once thought impossible. Computers have already benefitted the world greatly, so why anyone would want to limit their implementation is beyond me. Since before the @DATE1, computers have put tons of information into the hands of anyone who wants it. Before this people would have to physically go the library and tedrously search for information. Now, all one has to do is click ""search"". Surely, this is the way that is of the most ease to people, so it is surprising to see negativity toward it. Its @DATE2. Space colonization is less than @NUM1 years away, cybernetic are getting stronger and cheaper, and most businesses are run by people using computers. In this modern era computers are replacing factories and such as the new need-to-know industry. But rather than going to special schools to learn these skills, one could-use their own home computer. By simply typing up e-mails,people are the skills needed to help in the computer industry. One also, learns problem solving skills when dealing with viruses and etiqutte when communicating with unknown people. It's a new millenium, and computers have taken the forefront. Perhaps most importantly, computers connect us, People in the @LOCATION6 can instantly chat with people in @LOCATION5, and scientists in @LOCATION2 can hastily communicate with scientists in @LOCATION4. Try doing that with pigeons. With computers, preaking news in @LOCATION1 is breaking news in @LOCATION3, and families on seperate equators seem to be only a thin piece of glass away. This is the modern world, and if some people don't like the thought of it, than! I will never understand. In conclusion, computers are the present, and the future. I live in a world where converance is for everyone jobs skills are taught through lif sure, and @NUM2 million people can play one game at once (myself included). This is the modern world, and computers are its creator.",9
2043,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think people should spend less time on the computer. @PERSON1 told me that he isn't on computer much because there are better things in life then sitting in a chair in front of the computer. When you are always staring at a screan it can make you cross eyed or even need glasses. You should always want to spend time with family, work on homeworth, or even play around outdoors. I know everyone does care about their family and friends more then the computer. I wasn't on the computer for @NUM1 days in arow because everything I care about is all around me including family and friends. You can alway find away to have fun with family and friends. Someways are by sleeding, swimming, snowball fights, vacations, or many other options that I haven't mentioned. I'm sure you can think of many more great ideas that I haven't. Spend more time with your family and friends and get off the computer. Another thing I know, is that most kids don't get their homework done because they are alway playing games on the computer. Before you let your teen near the computer make sure their homework is done and done right. If your child doesn't have good grades that shows they need to make more time working and focusing on school and a little less time on computers. Do you see your kids outdoors at all? If you don't get them outside more and more each day. They will have more fun then they ever thought they would outdoors. Tell them they can have a friend over if they get off the computer and go outside. They can have a snowball fight, race, swim, or whatever else the weather alows. My mom tells me, herself, and everyone in the family tell everyone you know this and have a friend over. In conclusion don't spend your life on the computer. Spend time doing homework, hanging out with your family and friends, and go out side. All of this requires no electricity, save money and get off the computer!",8
2044,"Dear Newspaper, The effect of computers on people is negative. Much of the community is spending too much time on the computer instead of tending to their other needs. People are becoming unhealthy from less exercise and less time in nature. In addition computers are causing people to spend less time with their families and friends. Due to the advance in computers, many people spend too much time on the computer. From the results of a survey, @PERCENT1 of our community spends over @NUM1 hours each day on the computer. Think of the neglect that their homes and pets must be getting. People are becoming so engrossed in their computers that they are forgetting to clean their homes and feed their pets. How can computers be becoming a good thing when people's other obligations are being neglected? Not to mention that people are spending less time exercising and enjoying nature. A little over @PERCENT2 of our community has become obese since the advance in computer technology. When asked about changes in her life since the advance in computers @PERSON3 black had this to say. ""@CAPS1's true there has been a change in my life, I used to run @NUM2 miles each day, but since I have became addicted to my computer I barely run at all."" @CAPS2 of our town are unhealthy the are spending less time enjoying the beautiful nature in our town and more sitting infront of the computer screen. Don't you see a problem here? People have been spending less and less time interacting with their family and friends. @NUM3 in every @NUM4 @CAPS2 admit that since the advance in computers they have not spoken with their friends and family in @NUM5 straight weeks, where they used to speak with them every couple days. @PERSON1 says of sister @PERSON2 that @PERSON2 has not answered or responded to her calls at all since the advance in computers. Computers are pulling family and friends apart. With the advance in computers, when will these victims realize that they are alone with only their computer neglecting their real friends and family? In conclusion, the advance in computers is having a negative effect on @CAPS2. @CAPS2 are spending way too much time on the computer causing them to neglect their obligations. Our community is slowly yet strongly becoming physically and mentally unhealthy. Friends and family have been pulled apart due to the advance in computers. We must stop this advance in technology for the sake of our fellow @CAPS2.",10
2045,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a days more and more people use Computers Some people belive computers benefit our society but I understand not everyone does. Personaly, I belive compoters do benefit our society. One reason why I belive computers benefit our society is because they give people the ability to learn about other countries and people in other countries. On time I had to do a report on @PERSON1 and how she spent time with gorillias in other countries. Also, I think Computers benefit our society because they allow people to talk to each other online. One advantage of talking to each other online is if one of your close friends move can still keep-in-touch with them without running up your phone bill. Did you @CAPS3 @PERCENT1 of kids talk to each other online. Another reason why I agree that computers benefit our society are because it teaches hand-eye coordination. I belive hand-eye coordination is very important to hace for me I need to have hand-eye coordination because I play soft-ball and basketball. I understand why you might think computers don't benefit our society but I hope your thoughts have changed.",7
2046,"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1 you know people who work on computers all day are more obise than people who don't? I think people spend to much time on the computer. I say this because my mother works on the computer all day, then when she gets home she goes on @CAPS2. She is starting to gain weight. She doesn't spend enough time with her family and she doesn't go outsid unless it's to the car. First of all she is starting to gain weight because she is at work all she obese is sit at her desk all day, then when she gets home all she obese is go downstairs on the computer, and when she eats that is where you can find her. this isn't just my mother that doese this. Accountants do the same thing and so do lawers. this is why people need to spend more time off the computer and with their families. Secondly, people who work on computers all day don't spend enough time with their families. For example my friend has a dad who is an accountant. He is always teling me how he wishes he could spend more time with his family. I feel the same with my mom. If she spent more time with us than mabey she would be able to get out of the house are. Lastly, I don't think these people get enough time outside. Most people who have worked on computers all their life love became diabetics because they don't get enough exercise to keep their bodys healthy. For example my mother when she gets have she takes everything insid but bother to pat it away she goes strait to the computer. If she realize she left something in the car she runs to go get it and is always out of breath when she cames back. Then she goes to the computer to cool off. This is why people don't enjoy nature, get enough exercise, and get to see alot of their family. Theirfore why don't us do something about these who sit on their buts all day?",9
2047,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers do benefit societies because people think computers are important to them. Here are a few reasons why, @CAPS3 reason is computers have a positive effect on people. They love to check out cool websites on line. They can go on websites that they've already been to or try something new. Also, if people are trying to get work done online, the computer can help them get the job done. That way people don't have to struggle without @CAPS3. Another reason is people can talk with @CAPS3 another online. They could talk by @CAPS4 or by @CAPS5 chat. So, say for example, if someone wanted talk to a cousin they haven't seen in a while, they could via @CAPS5 chat online or maybe just talk to a friend just because they're bored. An easier way would be to @CAPS6 a friend and talk about how your life or his/her life is going. It's a great way to connect with other people. My last reason is kids and teens can do fun things online. For example, they can play games and activities on random websites. They could also make crafts on @CAPS7 @CAPS8 like make a card for a special occasion or something. They could also make music or videos to post for friends and family. But most importantly, they could just express themselves in many ways. So, now that you've heard my top @NUM1 reasons, do you think that computers benefit society? People think that computers are the best pieces of technology. You need to understand the importance of this, so please write back @CAPS9 with your decision. Thank you for your time.",8
2048,"I think that computers have a great effect on people. Computers help people by giveing directions, getting answers and getting gifts. My first reason is that a computer can give you directions. @PERCENT1 of people get lost because they do know the direction. The computer will give you direction to anywhere. For example you need to get from your house to the hospital and you don't know the directions? A computer can help you get the directions. Do you realy want to get lost. Next a computer will help you get answers. The makers of google say ""you can find all your answers here on google"". For example say you need the question to how to change brakes on a car? Go on google and you can find out how to. but on least, a computer will help you get gifts for people. Did you know @PERCENT2 of people can't find what gift theyre looking for. The other people say you can find anything in stores. Don't listen to them not all stores have are looking for. American.com states we have all you no what it is we have . So is this a god idea or what. To conclude a compter will help you got and get do help society in what you just read.",7
2049,"Dear @CAPS1: I belive that computers are a benefit to society. Computers are a very important part of life. They make life a whole lot easier then having to do something off knowledge. A computer is able to let you talk with friends or family that live in different areas all over the world. It also allows use to do research and make new discoveries. The computer is one of the most helpful utensils in this world. In short, computers make life easier without a doubt. They allows us to do homework assignments, reports, make the newspaper, etc. without a computer having to do this all by hand would be a some homework assignments require you to do research in a topic. It is go to the library to pick out a book but on the computer you would be able to gather more information in a faster of time. Reports might also report research to if a source of information could be gathered in a shorter amount of time why not use the computer. Then theirs your newspaper. The computer allow you to make the newspaper faster than you would help when you only had type written. The evolution in technology helps make our life less @CAPS2, talking to friends and family all over the world is something a computer was made to do we like facebook, myspace, aim, etc. If your family lives in a country such as @LOCATION1 and you wont be able to if you live in a different part of the world you would still talk to friends and a good friend or another miles away from when you live, probably wouldn't them there. You would go the internet to talk to him/her and keep in touch. This doesn't mean that you would be to spend time with friends and family. Schedule your time so could fit talking to distant family and hanging out with friends or family after school. Lastly, the computer lets use new discoveries about places or find something and a location that we have never been to. If you wanter to ho on vacation to a tropical area you might which areas are tropical and the places that are freezing cold all year long. If you wanted to explore places with the computer could find that information in a matter or But some people and forget that they like exercise. To sum it all us, computers are a good thing to have because of more benefits in society. They make life easier. In no task, we are allowed to interact with family or friends that live in different areas make new or find out information about places you never knew about.",9
2050,The witers you are the big loseers why won't people get off computer. Why try to save all the comptureys in the State that why i don't like the cant's of that because make me every mad of the agree with the people that why you are mad sackers the why no one likes you the agrees with the people what i don't you are make me bad today happen yasterday. I big tover that i am mad at this no half days u want half days every day. The computers show a lot bad stiff on the computers kiids can't like of the stiff on the computers i don't want no onetime computers I want cames and xbox @NUM1 xbox live of million people go on take to your friends that why i don't want no on the computeres that why cost to much money.,6
2051,"Computers have been around for not very long. Still, a few generations, including my own, have been raised on this technology. We @MONTH1 not be as social and outside as our parents and grandparents, but that doesn't mean anything. We can't go out as much as they could becaue of the many dangers outside our doors. Computers are also here to help with homework, look up local news, or just search for something to do like seeing a movie. Another factor is that they @MONTH1 not be perfect, but computers teach us an important lesson that we should all attempt to follow. When past generations were kids, they had so much freedom and time to have fun. They would return home from school, complete their homework and chores, and then they were out to see their friends. They were able to do this because all of the people in town knew each other so if theynoticed something suspicious, they reported it. Today most neighbors don't know each other so kids can't be looked after while out playing ball. The world is a cruel place with killers, rapists, addicts, and much more. To caps with this teens and children look for an alternative. It just so happens that we have computers which we can do anything on. For instance, i could play a game watch a video on youtube, listen to music, talk to friends, and search the""@CAPS1"". Yet adults want to take that away despite it being the only other thing we got. You msut look at what computers do for us that's good not just what's bad. Say i just hopped off the bus and am loaded with week to do. I pull out my math and it looks like another language to me. I then could just bring go the internet and look up how to do it. There's almost every possible""how to"" guide or the @CAPS1 so if you're having trouble starting up the lawn mower, then lok it up. Even if you're just bored or curious, any information can be obtained via the computer. Without @CAPS2.C.s or @PERSON1, our entire civilization would be last. Still, if ou ask most people, they'll tell you that the internet and computers are dark and evil places. That they're full of sick people and videos, but that's not necessarily true. Yes, there are many bad things on the internet, but there is in life too, right? In fact, i believe it is a great that there are very bad things online but you have to listen. Say you catch your child doing something bad like getting into fights. You'd sit him/her down and talk to them or punish them right? They'd learn from their mistake and probably wouldn't do anything like that again so why wouldn't that apply to computers too? Computers can teach us, through mistakes, how to be better people. In the end, i believe there @MONTH1 be a lot wrong with computers, but that they have a much better side too. Our world has changed, they're have to help, and they teach us an important life lesson. So why shouldn't they stay?",10
2052,"Dear Newspaper, I disagree with those experts, who say that people are spending to much time on their computers. I am pretty sure that people aren't on their computer most of their day. I think computer made society a lot easier. I'll tell you why. One reason I think computers have good affects on people is because they help children on school work. The computer helps children in a lot of ways. For example if a child needed to know the defenition of a word and they didn't have a dictionary, they can just look it up on the internet. The computer makes it easier for kids to find things. Instead of looking through a whole bunch of books, they can just go on the computer and get the information there. Therefore, the computers have good affects on people. Another reason I think computers have good affects on people is because it helps people of their job. At a lot of jobs computers are necessary. For example, teachers need computer for grades and assignments, people who work at the bank need computer to know who took out money and etc... Many jobs include working on a computer. Computers make work easier at jobs. Therefore, computers have good affects on people. Another reason I think computers have good affects on people because you learn more. You learn how to do many things. For example, if you typing an essay the computer checks the grammar. The computer see mistakes that you might have missed and points it out to you. You can find information in a computer easier than taking a while looking, for the information in a book. It makes work a whole lot easier. Therefore, I think computers have good affects on people. Now I hope the people who read this letter see where I am coming from. So, therefore, in my opinion, computers have good affects on people. ",8
2053,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have positive effects on people everyday. They allow people to research far away places and people. People can also use them to talk to people online and learn hand-eye coordination at the same time. One benefit that people gain from using computers is learning and researching about far away places and people. For example, if someone wanted to learn more about @LOCATION1, they can log into their computer and search @LOCATION1. By learning about @LOCATION1 people can be more aware of the people that live there too. @CAPS1 is a chance to learn the differences and similarities between their lifestyle without having to go on a trip. Since the computer provides all of this information people are @PERCENT1 more aware of all the global issues and not only the ones where the person lives. Also learning about a different place or culture might interest or encourage the person to actually visit the place and learn even more about @CAPS1 even with the research. In addition to providing information about different places, computer also teach people hand-eye coordination. Using a keyboard without looking helps people develop skills such as hand-eye coordination, @CAPS1 is important to have excellent typing skills because @CAPS1 can help students with their schoolwork and adults with their careers. Teachers @MONTH1 assign essays or prompts that must be typed and @CAPS1 would be beneficial for students to have the ability to type their essay efficiently. If a person has hand-eye coordination then @CAPS1 can also improve the way they play a sport. Some jobs require adults to have typing skills such as a secretary. Someone could not get the job they want because they don't have enough knowledge of computers to be able to do @CAPS1. Another reason that computers have a positive effect on people is that @CAPS1 even allows people to talk online with other people. This is positive because sometimes someone's best friend moves far away and can't call them because its long distance. They can use the computer to stay in touch with the person by talking to them with email, facebook, or @CAPS2. Also they can plan to meet each other once a year by losing the computer to communicate to one another. Even if the person doesn't live far away people can still talk to their friends online. They can socialize and plan events that can happen on the weekends or after school the next day. Some experts say that computers are not allowing people to interact with family and friends. that is not true because they can talk online and plan to meet each other and interact with them. In conclusion, computers positively effect people. The computer teaches people hand-eye coordination, and far away play and people. @CAPS1 is also a way people can talk to each other and stay in touch. People should be encouraged to use their computers.",10
2054,"Thirty or so year ago, technology was not exactly advanced. People did not have the technological our society has today, yet they live just fire.

Machines have really""taken over"" just like on those cheezy old-families. Without a doubt, society is @PERCENT1, dependent on their @CAPS5, and other technology. Is that healthy? Do you believe computers help or hurt our lives as @CAPS6, and humans? Many of us enjoy the wonders of @CAPS7's fine creation; unlimited texting! We text every we go, our cellphones are almost a part of us. Dont get me wrong, I love our generation's advancements on technology. In fact, I think computers make out lives much easier. If you want to do research on @PERSON1 for your @CAPS8 month project. The internet's got you covered. The old fashioned folks still prefer the library, but not us. If you want to talk to a friend, really quickly, just text them, their just a click away. A few uninlighted people, might think all of this technology just how lazy. What these few people who the virtual computers lives more convinient, @NUM1 out of @NUM1 teens say. In addition my fellow reader of the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11, computers teach us tons of things! Typing is a must have skill in today to work. Obviously Computers also have a variety at endless topics available to. The internet is like a gigantic library that offers you anything, and everything with just a click of a button. So explore away, you'll be amazed at the things youll in the of the iternet. too much of is bad for you. This also goes for the remarkably fascinating cyber world. It is important to about life outside your. there is many great things outside of a computer, @CAPS12 seems essential to and they use, however, it is to about family, friends and that good stuff. Use computers's moderately, your wife and kids will appreciate it. Before you try using that line of advice on kids, save your breath. It will not work. What have we learned today my fellow readers? the world of computers offer us many great things, and we should take advantage. If that, we would be fools not too. Those of us who are smart enought to understand the importance of computers in our daily lives, have accepted the challenge and are now part of our generation's finest achievement. When I look at my @NUM3 something year old @CAPS13 ma playing on the computer. I know it is not an impossible task and all can be to this @CAPS9 technology. Even our @CAPS14 @PERSON2 knows the importantce to reaching younber audiences by logging onto @CAPS3. @PERSON2 says,""The internet is apart of our lives, and it's a positive thing.

2055,"Who would rather stare at a bright nausiating screen than share time with your friends? Why would you sit inside, lying around when you could be running around outside in the fresh air? Why not get up and get active? You should want to hangout with friends run around, and enjoy the outdoors. Here's the controversy: does technological advances hurt people more than they help? Technology makes children and adults less active. @PERSON1, a specialist from the @ORGANIZATION1 organization @CAPS1 that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS2 spend more time watching @CAPS3 and on the computer that outside, getting exercise. This is a huge problem because that can lead to obesity. Obesity can cause high blood pressure and diabetes. Some people @MONTH1 say technology gives you better hand-eye coordination. This @MONTH1 be true however, wouldn't you rather be getting the same or even better hand-eye coordination by playing sports, which also benefit your health. Replace video games with baseball and get more things in return. Enjoying nature is fun and captivating. The beautiful, colorful flowers fill your nose with delighting scents. There are blushing roses and cheery sunflowers. Along with plants there are lots of different animals scampering around outside. Birds are perched up on a tree, chirping back and form as if conversing about their day. Not only is nature wonderful to look at, it gets you out of the house and away from time-wasting things like computer games. Before turning on that television, remember what living things were already given to this world, waiting for you to take in their beauty. Time with friends and family is something you want to hold on to and cherish. Why waste it ""surfing the net"" on gazing blankly at a box. People who care about their loved ones would rather spend their time with them instead if inanimate object. Family and friends are what are important in life. You should care most about them. Try to peel yourself of the @CAPS3 screen and talk to the ones who care most. Now is the time to see whether you support technology advances or think you could be doing better things. You could be running around, having fun while staying healthy. Bright flowers and giddy animals are right outside your door. Most importantly the people around you should get more time from you than your electronics so get off that couch, get outside and spend time with people you care about the most!",11
2056,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers have become increasingly popular and advanced. So much so that I feel they are intefering with our lives andv having negative effects on the @CAPS4 people @CAPS5 example, many people spend hours on computer when they could be excercising and staying healthy. Another negative effect is how much computers cost, and the financial problems computers brings. Lastly, computers are a huge factor of how families have been spending less & less time together. One way computers effect us is exercise. Many people practically live on their computers and never leave the house. This is a problem, especially with the obesity issue how it is already in @LOCATION1. It is a fact that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS12 spend more time on their computers than exercising. It is not healthy to sit at a computer, ""frying your brain"", (as my mom would say) and not exercising at all. Why not go take a jog, or go to the gym with your friends, @CAPS6, I've chosen backyard football with neighborhood friends over computers many times, and I've been happy with that choice. I beleive that computers are effecting how much exercise we got and not in a positive way. If everyone ditched computers @CAPS5 a little while and exercised a little more, we'd be closer to erasing our countries tttle of the.""@CAPS7 @CAPS8 in the @CAPS9."" @CAPS10 the negative effect computers have on excercise is a major issue, it is not the only one. Another huge issue is their effect on money and financial problems. New technology is cool, but it comes with a price (literally), Technology, especially computers, is getting more experience almost by the day. Computers are ridiculously expensive, and it is starting to have an effect on the people wallets. Many people feel the need to have the bigger and better things, such as new computers. Some people buy a new computers model when it comes out just to say they have it. Who has hundreds of @MONEY1 to spend in the blink of an eye to buy a new computers which also supply you with even more bills. You need to pay @CAPS5 repair bills, @CAPS11 my computer broke and my dad had to spend close to @MONEY1 trying to fix it. And many people have computer in their house. This could let to financial problems and here are better things to spend money as such as healthy fresh foods that our body deserves. Computers have also started to limit the amount of family time that @CAPS12 are getting. Several families almost never speak to one another because they are to buried in their computers. One good example of this was on the @ORGANIZATION1 show. @ORGANIZATION1 had a family on @CAPS13 that was totally anti-social with one another. The mother would make dinner, and the other family members would just grab it and take it whenever to eat. The dad went to his office to do work on his laptop, the son went to his room to use the computers, and the daughter did the same. The mother was left alone, either to use a computer or to sit & eat by herself. This is a great example of how computer can and are effecting the amount of family time @CAPS4 families are having. With computers taking over their lives many families now spend little or no time with their family. There are so many other things to do, like to take a family bike ride, take a road trip, make a family craft, or even play a board game or learn to cook. The only way to get better families is to closer, and computers are restricting the amount of family time families are recieving. Now I hope you see the negative effects computers are having on @LOCATION1. lack of exercise, wasted money and minimal family time are only a few problems. If we didn't have computers, these problems would go away. @CAPS10 computers do have some benefits, it would be better in the long run @CAPS5 them to disapear. That is my opinion.",12
2057,"Dear local Newspaper, People seem to be using computers a lot more, well this is a great thing, computers are used to @CAPS3 anything, @CAPS1, surf the web, chats, buissness, typing letters, movies, news, research, hand-eye coordination. Those are only a few things computers are good for. I believe that computers @CAPS3 benefit society. The first good thing about computers is it teaches hand-eye coordination, Hand-eye coordination can come into good use such as, keyboarding, typing school paper, searching websites, searching research on google and typing buissness papers. All these things become something in sentence everyday life and hand-eye coordination helps and does a big part in typing. The next thing which helps everyone is using a computer for learning. And I mean learning about anything. You name it and a computer has information about it.Whether it be pictures or websites with pages of typed words. A few examples are, differenr cultures, foods, technology, schools,science,math,history,english,celebrities,music,supplies,stores,clothing,accesories, places, everything is on a computer. A computer can teach you different and A system that The last thing @CAPS1 @CAPS3 you I know I way of teensv and @CAPS4 with a computer have a facebook account. Facebook is made so you can chat with your friends and family who @MONTH1 live faraway. You can also post pictures and send videos to each other. Facebook is mostly for @CAPS4 and teens who wants to chat and reconnect with family and friends. But speaking of chatting with each other, another way chatting on a computer is used is webcams. Webcams are little cameras either installed into your laptop or its attached to your computer. You turn it on and you and your friend can talk and see each other over the computer! It's great, and family who live far away @CAPS3 it too! In conclusion, I beleive computers are not causing any problems and they are use then correctly and they benefit our society.",9
2058,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you have a @CAPS5? I also believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers help in many ways. You can play games when you are stressed, they can be used for research, and allow you to talk to friends and family online. After a long day of work or school people can be pretty tired. Why not sit down in front of the @CAPS5 and play some games? Dr. @DR1 @PERSON1 says ""Computers are great way to take off the pressure of a stressful day of work. I would reccomend to anybody who is stressed to sit down and play some @CAPS5 games."" @CAPS5 games can also teach you about hand eye coordination. If you @CAPS4 a sport having hand eye coordination is important. For example; in compell cheerleading, through my expereinces, you are lifting people into the air and if they fall you need to be able to chach them. If you you don't have good hand eye coordination you wont be able to check the person you are lifting. Nobody knows everything. Computers are a good source for research. They can help you with finding the right vaction spot, if you need to @CAPS4 a project for school or work, and even if you just want to learn more. If everybody had computers @PERCENT1 of students grades will increase because the @CAPS5 will help them.

2059,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, @CAPS1! A muse that's used on computers has just clicked on a game for someone to play. Computers have advanced so much through the years. Lets face it, the majority of people throughout the world have at least one computer in their house hold. But the amont of time that people go on the computer for is really the real world and cyber bullying are key factors as to why computers @CAPS9't benefit society. Let's take a deeper look into those issues. Running, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and waking are all forms of exercise right? I @CAPS9't think anywhere in @CAPS8's something about cliking a button or mouse. Truth is, as @CAPS5 grows, so does the amount of people who are overweight. But, @CAPS11 you stay on the computer for more than hour, and ddon't exercise, that is not gona to make the rise for overweight people in @LOCATION1. Some say clicking a button could be beneficial but I just @CAPS9't agree. I'm more than @PERCENT1 sure that @CAPS11 every single @CAPS5 was allowed to go on the computer for just anneccessary and up their exercise, that maybe the overweight number will decrease of course, that goes into eating healthy. Exercise benefits the society, not computers. ' @CAPS7, are you coming house?"" "" Not, I'm to my friends on !"" @CAPS8 is nothing to her mother. Computers seperate teens from the real world. Most teenageers most likely talk to their friends on the computer then for a test. That goes for adults to the computer and world chat then go to , @CAPS9't you think on the computer that I'm sure not happen in the real world. Computers the bring it together. @CAPS13. The one word most @CAPS10 deny doing. Yet, a lot of @CAPS10 @CAPS9't even notice their doing it. it comes to all different forms. It court be as little as calling someone a name or as threatening to kill someone. I'm taking a shot here but, a lot of these @CAPS10 who do it, know for a fact, that they wouldn't say it to the persons face. @CAPS8 are @CAPS10 who are scared to come to school because of @CAPS13. How does that benefit the society? @CAPS10 being scared is defiently not good it's the total opposite. @CAPS13 is hot the way to go. In the end, it's really up to the person themselves @CAPS11 they want risk their health by not exercising, or seperating themselves from their family, or maybe even bullying someone on the computer Exercising, @CAPS12 and @CAPS13 are all reasons for why computers @CAPS9't benefit the society. Stop the growth of Computers.",10

2061,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 there have been many arguments about computers and their effects. I, personally, have mixed feelings. Computers can have a lot of pros and cons! For one, many people don’t get enough @CAPS7 when they own a computer, especially teengers. But also, we can gain alot of knowledge from computers. Finally computers can take you away from or even connect you to, your family. Computers could really benfit us, or do the exact opposite. In todays world of technology, hours can pass without being noticed. This could become a very bad thing, because then @CAPS7 would be pushed aside @PERCENT1 of teenagers aged @NUM1 stated that they spend at least three hours after school on the computer. That's three hours of son wasted when, instead of chatting to friends online, they could have gone outside and exercised. Also, dont forget the parents! With sites like @CAPS5, when lets them talk to friends and play games they could be sucked in too.""@CAPS6 wait does any of this have to do with @CAPS7?"" you might ask. Truthfully, everything. During the day, when just walking around outside be @CAPS7, people the computer. Do you think anyone wants to @CAPS7 in the dark? I sure don't @CAPS7 is greatly imported by computers. With the use of computer, we can learn so much. work, we constantly need to learn different countries. Their conditions, culture, economy, you it. What computers, we would be able to receive this easily, if at all. Second, we can even learn about our owe country. Computers help with our leaving eryday. The @CAPS8 of computer and is very mixed. For example computers can contact you and your family you have hour family tourch with each others. Also, computers can take you away from the family. If everyday your on the computer, soon if not carefol, you could start spending all your time on it, even eating at it. Finally, sending pictures and video through email is very common. From a childs frist steps to a graduation, if somebody unfortunatly coudn't be there, it could seem like they were. Through",9
2062,"Dear Local Newspaper. I hear that many experts believe that people spend way to much time on the computer, well thats why im writing this. I disagree on your opinion because from what I hear the computer helps the human body with alot of things. Like it teach then hand-eye cordination. It also gives them the chance to communicate, lets them learn about where they are from and about other people and places. The reason why I disagree on the experts opinion is cause without the computer how else would people learn about where they live and other places, besides books. Like say book wasn't invented how else would we know about where we live and stuff. Computers all you have to do is find a computer and you would know. Like if you don't know how to reach the computer will teach you just go to the website and say wat you want to read and it pops-up. Another reason I disagree is because the computer helps you on your hand-eye cordinates too. Cause when you are typing or messaging some one you are using you hand cordination. And when you are reading something you are using you eye cordination, like there are many more way the computer help people. The computer also does other things. It lets you communicate with people you know or @MONTH1 not know. Like surpose that you have a family member that lives faraway and no only can talk of the computer you both can communicate if you can talk over the computer to. Now do you see why I disagree it so you would change your opinion. But if not you just don't get that the computer is alway needed.",8
2063,"Dear Local Newspaper, I am taking the time to write this letter, because I feel that computers are beneficial to everyday life. Not only do they improve hand-eye coordination, but there are many websites to find long-lost friends or that special someone. Computers also can be combined with software to create the ultimate learning experience. It's rather simple to see why computers are beneficiary. Right off the bat, hand eye coordination is improved. No pen intended, but I play baseball and I feel that my computer time has helped up my batting average to five hundred. Experts that spending all day on a computer will soften your brain and make you a slouch. This is true, but not if the computer is used in moderation, like everything in life. Those same ""expert"" providing us with false accounts are probably the ones who sit slouched at a computer all day. Who are t hey to lie to us? I strongly believe that many physical activities are positively by sports. Without further ado, it is so easy (a caveman could do it) to keep in touch with old friends and relatives, or possibly even find the love of your life. Modern day websites, such as @CAPS1, allow everyone with internet access, to reliably go online and chat with their friends. Sure, it @MONTH1 not be the same as talking wiht that friend in person, but what if they live halfway across the world? It's the next best thing in life. I, personally, don't have an account in this website, but approximately ninety percent of my friends do, and it largely impacts their everyday lives. Many modern day softwares, such as @CAPS2 @CAPS3, (a language program) help our nation, and even the world. Soldiers in the great @LOCATION1 need to know basic things in many languages, because they wouldn't be able to interact with @CAPS4 the @CAPS5 interpreter. Without translation efforts, and many other effects, we could be losing the war, horridly, we wouldn't be such a great nation if we were free, because freedom is our biggest right as an independent country. Coming to a conclusion, computers ar beneficiary to everyday life. They improve abilities, such as hand-eye coordination, and provide sample resources to find long-lost friends. Computers also have software compatibility, so that our nation can be free. Well, there's not much left to say, so go publish this and let the people hear the truth!",10
2064,"Dear @CAPS1, I am a supporter in technology and I belive comptures are an important part in use them for work, recreation, and to learn new and current things around the world. Computer with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about current events and far away places, also the opportunity in communicate with others several away in many different ways. I belive computers are a very useful tool that should be used to extent. Computers in schools all access @CAPS2 mue and continue to help children lean educate them with materials that possibly could not be taught in the classroom. They teach kids with special needs hand-eye coordination and moter skills. Without computers kids would be mostly taught which isn't bad but its not the same as having valuable a information a click away. Have you ever been to forigen country? Or are you doing a project in school on one and you need some quick facts. You turn to an encyclopida that was published in @DATE1. Maybe the leader has your country war @LOCATION1.

You have the population, feeds curent leader everything to know. With modern day you can learn about far away place out trip there. Do you have family that doesn't live near you but you wish you could jump on that computer and pop up @CAPS4! On that website, and others like it, you can chat with friends and family that are far away from you. Even if you just perfer to chat with someone online in a chat room, the computer many ways of having you communicate with others. Talk to them? Computers are a very resourcefull tool and when used properly it can benifit you in your school work, social life, keep you updated in current events, help you about, and even entertain you and you friends with a fun game or a watch.

2066,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people believe that computers are one of the best pieces of technology in this world today. However, computers can actually be much more of a nuisance than people realize. Computers do serve their purpose and they are very useful, but computers take the place of too @CAPS3 important things. Computers have such a negative effect on people, which is destroying our society. Computers have this bad effect on people because this technology takes time away from people exercising, people rely to much on computers, and it takes time away from interacting with family and friends. Have you ever wondered why @LOCATION1 is sometimes referred to as fat? Well, this is because citizens of this country don't spend enough time exercising, and spend too much time on the computer. The average persons is on the computer for at least an hour a day. According to health statiticians, a person should get at least an hour of exercise a day. The time that is spent on the computer could be used for exercise. Now @CAPS4 you're really ""glued"" to the computer, you can still use it while exercising. For example, while my dad is using the treadmill, he watches television series on the computer. So. being on the computer for a long time is not an excuse for not exercising. Unfortunately, way too @CAPS3 people don't believe this, which is part of the reason why computers have such a negative effect on people. @CAPS3 parents of children who go to school agree that students rely too much on computers. This is very true. When students get home, they go on the internet to find the answer to their home work. Instead of ""surfing"" the web, these children could easily walk to the library and get an encyclopedia or dictionary to find the answers. @NUM1 times out of @NUM2, you can find answers better in a book than online. In addition, kids always rely on things like e-mail to stayin touch with each other. Whatever happened to calling someone, or mailing a letter to them? It can be guareenteed that @CAPS4 the internet across the world was shutdown for even just a day, kids would go insane. This has a negative effect on the human mind because people don't know how to work hard anymore because everything is on a computer. now, why should our society be destroyed by just a little piece of technology? How @CAPS3 people get to interact with friends and family on a daily basis? The answer is: not too @CAPS3 @CAPS4 people would take some time a way from computer, they could interact with family and friends. Instead of contacting there people through a computer, it would be much better to actually see them in person. Furthermore, instead of playing game on the computer, you could invite some friends over your house to have a friendly game of cards. The kids have fun, and get to interact with each other @CAPS5, instead of e-mailing your family, family, you could have dinner with them somewhere. It gives everyone a chance to catch up on things. Plus, @CAPS3 people seem to have a better time when they can verbally interact with each other, rather than through a computer. @CAPS4 computers didn't take the place of family and friends interacting, maybe this technology wouldn't have a bad effect. In conclusion, it is clear that computers have a negative effect on people. First of all, computers take time away from people exercising. Secondly, people rely too heavily on computers. Last, computers take time a way from people interacting with family and friends. Think about it. Computers are having bad effects on people, and we don't even realize it. @CAPS4 we are supposedly such a strong country, how can we let the simple computer slowly destroy our society?",11
2067,"Dear, Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 computers is a good thing but in most cases I disagree with @CAPS2 people use them. I know most people who have computers or don't, are debating about problems, the amount of time people spend on the computer and how these machines effect the environment. Lets take a glimpse at those ideas. Did you know that the amount people spend on the computer is @NUM1 hours average a day! In my opinion that means @CAPS3 and the rest of the people in the world use their time in the computer way too much. @PERSON3 a computer opperator told @ORGANIZATION1 that he is fixing more and more computers each year. To me this means laptops and such can't handle the way people are using them. This is a big bennefactoring problem to the usage of computers. More await for you to know. People next to the computer for hours but what they really don't know, is that could cause obesity, and maybe even eye problems ""In the time we are on the computers we been exersizing"" says @PERSON2 at @CAPS4 @CAPS5 school. @PERCENT1 of obisity in the world is from the computer and people not doing something else like enjoying nature. In addition to obisity, computers are changing the world dramaticly, by making people different. If people are different they treat the environmen differently, either for better of for worse. I think for worse. @PERSON1, Nature preserver noticed and reported less and less people out of the house to enjoy nature each @DATE1. Even very @CAPS5 populated states has reported less people outside in the environment. They say @PERCENT2 of their population is in their homes either on the computer or some other technology device. It's not good to use computers when we can enjoy our planet while we have it. If we keep using computers the environment will get ruined even more, we will have @CAPS5 populations of overweight citizens, and the time spent on the computer will be almost all the time, we need to do something fast about computers as well as other devices like cell phones. Therefore, I say maybe higher prices so @CAPS5 on computers, and make people pay even more for internet. We can figure something out to help with this situation.",9
2068,"A computer is considered a genius to people. It can provide information and chat with other people. Although these things great, you forget about yourself. Your eyes will be glued to the screen, but not on yourself. Books have been a great resource to everyone around the world. They provide information. Computers provide information, but they don't let you exercise, spend time with family, and enjoying nature. Anyone that has a computer knows you can do almost anything on it. Some people don't understand there are people that steel information from you with viruses. Those people can take your credit card number and many more important information from you. Did you know @LOCATION1 is the fattest country? Many people say it's from fast food. That is true, but it is also from sitting in a chair all day with your eyes glued to a screen. Why would you do that when your friends and family are, waiting to have fun with you? The computer has many websites that allow you to play games. Why would you do that when you can play games with family and friends? As you are doing that you are also enjoying nature and exercising at the same time. Only caring and friendly people would want to do this, but unpleasant and grampy people sit in a chair all day ingnoring everything but a computer. Ninety percent of @CAPS1 get married to a male or female. If you are the person that loves your computer, marry it. People who get married to a person are considered normal. Computer lovers are considered weird. Do you want to be a normal person that has a great time away from computers or not? Statistics say that a computer is the master of providing information. Why would you get information from a box when you can get it from a library? Why do you think libraries were built, to look pretty? All the intellegent people read books to find information. If someone has kids they need to learn to read. Eighty-five percent of all children that start reading at a young age are most likely to be very successful as an adult. At a library you can get information and meet new people at the same time. You cant do that with a computer. ""@CAPS2 am I loosing money; I didnt buy anything?"" That is what a person would say when someone found a way to get in your computer and take your credit card number. Yes, a computer can do many things, but they can also do some bad things. Smart and responsible people would know what a virus is once it is in your computer. There are some people that are very intellegent and bad. Those people send viruses to people on computers to steel data from you. If someone spends a long time on a computer then the virus will have enough time to get to your computer. If you just close down the computer nothing will happen. Computers have viruses, but the only virus someone can get is when it is winter and get the flu. Would you rather get sick for a short time or loose your information forever? Sixty-nine percent of people that spend their whole day on the computer get a virus in there computer and get stolen. It is alright to spend a short time on the computer.",10
2069,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 im going to start off saying I agree with you but then I disagree. I agree because yea computers are very helpful to kids it helps us do our homework, school projects, and helps us with more stuff but I also disagree because people do get excersise moving your fingers are helping you exersise so is breathing and it also helps with peoples typing the more you type @CAPS2 sit on the computer you learn how to type but you also learn informational site. I also agree because you might family you havent seen in forever and you can go online and talk to them. When you know you can make a routine like you say okday I getfrom school do my homework, go take snower go on the computer for about a hour and a half then go out side and play around or go explore or go for a walk or something. I understand people do stay on the computer fo a long time, but some people rather sit there and gain wait but that's them. They do what the please. And even when people are on the computer they can be looking up new ways to lose wait. You never know what they are doing. They teach you hand-eye coordination. Yeah I understand that and I can relate to it to I used to always look at the keyboard its just like a video game controller you have to memorize all of the buttons and where they are if you think about it like that then you'll end up typing faster and faster. @CAPS2 I get to get going.",7
2070,"Computers definitly benefit society. Computers are becoming the number one source of news and entertainment. Some experts believe computers are not good because it keeps them from doing things such as talking with friends and family, and keeps people from excersizing. They are wrong because computers have programs that let you talk to your family and friends, such as @CAPS1. It allows you to send text messages with each other. Also, new computers have equipment inside of it and you can video conferance with someone. You can talk to the computer and the person you want to talk to can see and hear you. The internet has all kinds of nature photos on it. You can search want you want to see, and before your eyes, it is there. Although it would be better to see the outside world up close, with a touch of a button, you can see things that are halfway across the globe. Take @LOCATION1, for example. It is a long flight to get there, and is probally expensive. If someone who likes excersize has a computer, they can buy equipment. Finaly, computers help your hand eye coordination. If you are on the web looking for information, and you find a link to what you are looking for you won't have to worry about moving the mouse in the wrong direction. To sum up, computer are an essential piece of technology. They let you communicate with your friends and family, allow you to see nature, and raises your hand-eye coordination",8
2071,"Imagine living in a world without any computers; @CAPS1 things would be so much tougher, people would be wasting paper, and we wouldn't be able to communicate like we do now. The computer is a very helpful resource, a conserver, and a good way of communication amoung friends, family, business, and more. First of all, computers are very helpful to every single person in this world because it's full of knowledge. I can tell you everything about anything. A lot of people would disagree with having computers because the claim that it makes you dumb, but when you really think about it, it gives you so many more answers than a textbook would. Next, computers save trees by having people send emails instead of writing letters or taking tests online instead of giving everyone a paper. People also say that people need to get out and enjoy nature, well you can't really enjoy nature when there aren't any trees left. Also, just to make the paper causes for polution in the air because paper is made at factories, so with a computer you would be saving more than just trees, you would be going green and saving the earth. Last but not least, computers help people communicate all around the world at any time. It even allows you to see someone even if they are miles away or even in a different continent. Theres oovoo, facebook, myspace, etc., they all give you a way of communicateing without having to drive to that persons house. In conclusion, computers help people and the earth in a lot of ways, like helping researchers, saving nature, and helping people communicate to their loved ones. So when people say they disagree with computers, I remind them that its only here to help and make life easier for everyone.",8
2072,"What do I think about people spending too much time on the computers and not exercising often? Well, i'll tell you what think about it. I'm not saying it's bad you just need take a break from it. Excersise is good for you your active & playfut it's real fun. To begin, you should plan how long to stay on a computer. So for example @NUM1 - @NUM2 hrs. plan a schedule what websites you want to go on. Say you want check your email for @NUM3 or @NUM4 minute if you have a lot. The play computer games for @NUM5 mins. After your going to type a report that might take you an hour, your finished now! Next, you can play and excersise. The sports play are baseball, basketball, football, soccer, dodgeball, and many more. Or the games you can if you don't like sports frisbee, catch, footrace, hide and seek and more. These activties can give a break from the computer. Finally, there is one more way you can spend time off the computer you can go out with you family to the movies, waterpark, restaurant, road trip, and more. It gets your off of unimportant stuff. It's relax",7
2073,"Local newspaper, I am concernd about the amount of kids that use the internet. With your help will decress this number. Imagin you are a @NUM1 year old kid that has problems in school, with many people. The intrenet is just another way. Those kids can bully you. This bullying is called cyber bullying. This kind of bullying can get you into serious trouble if the things you say are. The cyber bullying number has incressed rapidly through the past @NUM2 years. In @DATE1 the cyber bullying number was @PERCENT1 of kids school. Now in @DATE2 its gone up to @PERCENT2 of. You being newspaper care. For I will be talking about exercise. Exercise has been a big topic in the last few years because of obesely. Kids become obese because they play video games on the computer more than taking a jog outside, or kicking a soccer ball around. Im not saying kids shoud stop playing video games but video games should be a a week tops. I personaly love to be outside playing soccer but most kids dont. At @ORGANIZATION1 they took a test, this test shows that a weight kids average day is, go to school, go home, play on computer, secred activity for a hour then more computer me away. My last butt certinly not least is the safty of the internet. Many people go on chat rooms. These chat rooms are with total strangers that the computer choses. Some of these people say they are @NUM3 year old girl but you never no. These people @MONTH1 learn your information if you tell them and can track you down. Another thing about the internet is anything you put on the internet will never be erased. Those are my reasons why internet is bad. Thank you.",8
2074,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter for you to state my opinion or what computers do to @CAPS1 and yourself. Have people notice what computer are doing? Computers are taking away it alot of to things. There good for the news but when yo do able of other stuff like play video games it gets addicting. I know this first hand because I use to be addicted too. It takes away the fun stuff. You spend less time with family and friends. You don't excersise as much and you can't enjoy nature or a computer! Don't get me wrong, computers are handy but you should only spend little time on them. They have some advantiges like learning about faraway places with a click of the mouse. They're good for planning a vacation with family and friends. I mean looking at sites, finding hotels and more. BUT, like I said before its hard to pull youself off the computer once you've saw something you liked. Computers also take away social skills. I talking about online dating. You're not interacting with people in a face to face. Also same of these online websites have predators. They will seem trustworthy until the find out where you live then they'll kidnap you, then rape you, then most likely kill you. Do you want this to happen to you?! I'm no, would you want this to happen to you're children? Let me guess, same answer. So stay off the computer as much a possible.",7
2075,"I actually think that computers are good for people. I think this because cmputers give you a lot of information. Say that you are doing a social studies project on @LOCATION1 and you need alot of detail on it you need a flag what its goverment is like and much more stuff like that. The computer is an excellent way of gettig alot of accurate information about what you are researching. Also it is good for just relaxing and playing games when you have free time. Also I dont really follow about what theyre saying about people are spending too much time on their computer for example theyre not exercising, enjoying nature or interacting with family or friends for the family and friends because on the internet you could talk with your family, say they are on vacation in @LOCATION2 and they left you alone at your house, you could set up a video link or just write to them, asking them how theyre doing. And the same thing with your friends. And instead of spending youre whole day on a computer do what I do. First you should make a list of whatever you need to be done. Then set a time that you could manage to do all of this. For example during the @DATE1 before my seventh grade year I had a little list that said @NUM1 to @NUM2 eat breakfast @NUM3 to @NUM4 work eat @NUM4 to @NUM6 play my playstation three. For the whole @NUM7 to @NUM8 months of @DATE1 I folliwee this schedule. Then when my dad get home I would go ask him if I could go ride my bike with my friends. Then I would take a shower eat again then I would go on my computer so if everyone had theyre priorities finished before they went on a computer they would have any problems. But overall I think that computers are a very good way of getting research or school work done. Also for chatting with your friends or just relaxing or playing games. Also I really think that it does teach hand eye coordination so when youre typing yuo dont have to keep looking down at the keyboard then back up at the monitor. So this is why I think computers are good for you if you have a well running schedule.",8

Kids spend more time on the computer because they don't want to go outside. Computers can help you sort out things and help kids with there homework or an aplaction for high school. People spend to much money on the internet bill for spending to much time on the computers. Computer's can break down and you have to buy a new one for a lot of money. More people buy computers because there starting to build t.v. in them.",5
2077,"Dear Local newspaper. I'm writing this letter to the Local newspaper to give my opinion on the affects computer have on people. I think people can learn in the computers more and more every day. I think is an opportunity for some people to meet other poeple in differents part of the world. People can learn differents cultures on the websites. Is you continue reading I will give you more details on my reason. I think people can learn on the computer because. We can learn about other peoples cultures. People can look for information on the @CAPS1 when they need it. And its good for school projects because you can look for information in the @CAPS1. Thats why people can learn with computers. I said you can learn different cultures because. We can meet people different then us and we can learn about there culture. We can look for websites on the @CAPS1 that has information for different cultures. And we can tock about our cultures on the website. And that is why you can learn different cultures. I said you can meet people because. There are a lot of website that you can meet people. You can chat with people on @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION1 ect. You see new people every day that wants to be you're friend. And those people can become something for you. You can meet people from around the world. Some times people spend a lot of time on the @CAPS1. but thats there problem because that means that they don't have nothing to do. And I think is good because on a website you can be you're self like if you have a myspace you c an put it whatever you like it. And people should be more responsible. Thanks for reading my letter.",8
2078,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are benefical to @CAPS1 society, and helped bring @CAPS1 society to where it is today. It has helped advance technology, communication, and information. Without the computers, @CAPS1 race would not be as fan as it is today. The computer was a great advance in technology, which led to new advances. After the computer was invented, people learned how to make touch screeens for the computers. This was something beyond anyones imagination! With theese computers, restaurants have become tons more efficiant with seating people. Another advance is learning games. Most people think that kids spending a lof of time on the computer was a bad thing. With theese learning games, this is not entirely true kids can learn new things at home and not just at school. Studies show that kids who play theese games at home do @PERCENT1 better in school than at home. Wouldn't you want your kids to do that well in school? This dosen't exactly mean kids should spend all their time on the computer. They should still spend a good amount of time playing outside. Before computers were invented, the only way to communicate with someone was to call them, or write a letter. If we didn't have computers, theese would still be the only way. Calling someone for every little thing you need to tell them could end up costing a lot money. Writing a letter takes time, and even more time for the person to get it. With computers has came email. Your email gets sent to your friend in less than a minute, and is free of cost. You can send documents to people that would normaly cost money to ship from fedex or @ORGANIZATION3. Furthermore, with inventions likes @ORGANIZATION2, all you need is a webcam and you can video chat with somebody for free. Now instead of visiting relatives every time you want to or have to see them, you can vidieo chat with them. One of the greatest inventions that came from the computer is the internet. This is one of the things that has made humans smarter. You can get accurate, up to date information on the internet. An encyclopedia isn't always up to date and cannot update information daily like the internet. Although people believe that you should spend more time outdoors than on the computer, the internet can help you to get outdoors. You can look online for vacation spots, and plan your vacation on the internet. @PERSON1, a mother of four says, ""@CAPS1 last few trips, we use the internet to plan @CAPS1 vacation, and they were the best trips we have had."" People will argue that kids spend, too much time on the computer and not enough time playing sports or exercising. With new awarness of this, there are computer adds everywhere advising kids to go outside. Computers are bennefical to @CAPS1 society and helped bring @CAPS1 race to where we ar today. Without computers, wheve would we be today? ",10
2079,"Some @MONTH1 think that computers are no good for your brain or what not, but I beg to differ.

People say that sitting in front of that computer screen is just wearing you away, but what they might not know is that it can improve your hand eye coordiantion.

You find out things from centeries ago, say on any war or historical event, to your favorite book that just resently published. it can also enform you on the local news incase you missed the news on @CAPS1.V. You want to keep in contact with friends or family more often, well if you had a computer, you can do so. Theres all kinds of ways to keep in contact from aim, to myspace, to facebook. You can instant message or email anyone of you choose. So you can the excuse well I couldn'd get in contact because if you have a computer than you could at any time.

2080,"Dear local newspaper, More and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I don't agree with the thinking that we are spending too much time on these computers and time enjoying nature and with family and friends. My first reason why i don't agree with in because you would not about far away places and people. My second reason is because the computer allowed you to talk to friends and family that don't live new you. Third is because without computer technology we wouldn't be able to learn at much. Computer technology is very important without it as you can see many of especially studies teachers wouldn't be able to learn much and teach as much about many places and people. It is very important to know about different places and cultures because when we grow up we wouldn't know many things about cultures. By using the computer and learning about places it @MONTH1 be one of the places we might want to visit when we grow up. This is the first reason why i don't agree with the experts. My second reason why i don't agree with the experts is because the computer to talk to friends and family. Its always important to keep in touch with family and friends that don't live near you that way you know how they are doing. By using the internet you @MONTH1 even new friends and get to know more people. There are many days when people are bored so they just go on the computer and chat. Although you wouldn't know who the real person you're with is it's good to have a good time talking to them. My last reason why i don't agree with the experts is because without computer technology we wouldn't even have computer classes. No matter if you are using the computer you are still exercising your fingers the keyboard and processing is for. In school we do many projects in computer that help us learn about people cultured or article life. This my last reason on why i don't agree with the experts. I have explained three reason why i don't agree with the exports thinking that we are spending too much time on our computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and entercating with family and friends. My three reasons were that by using the computers we got to learn about far away and people, we also get to talk to friends and family that don't live and we also get to learn more with them then without computer tech.

2081,"Dear Newspaper, This is a very exciting prompt. Most people agree that those who support advances in technology believe that computers have position effect on people.

Others have different ideas some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on the computers and less exercising, doing homework, enjoy nature and spending time after school or in a program.

2082,Dear local newspaper my opinion are that it is good to have computer and it's also bad. Computers are a very advances technology. The reason why I think that computers are good is cause you could do a lot of sotf on them the reason why I think computers are also bad is cause there are bad people that could try to do something to you. My first reason is that computers are very good cause they are a very advances technology they also have a positive effect on people . They also have teach hand - eye and coordination. Another reason is ability to learn new things. You could also learn about faraway places and people. It even allows people to go online and talk to other people. The reasons why I don't think computers are good for people is cause they are spending too much time on their computers. and less time exercising enjoying nature. Another reason is interacting with family and friends. And cause there always be dad people that want to do hamre. Those are the things I think about computers.,7

You cant do any of this without one. I know these things because I use one all the time at home my whole family uses one my cousins mu relitives even my friends it is not good to use it all the time though sometimes it to talked and exercise.

2084,"Computers are used all the time. Some people think that we spend way to much time on them, and others think that they have a possitive effect on people. I think they have a positive effect because on computers you can learn, find out about places you've never heard, have fun, and you can even talk to relatives. There are so many things to learn, and computers have so much information. It you are having trouble with any of your school subjects, the internet has answers and explanations. Many people go to college online. It is much easier, and you do the same things you would have to do in the class. Learning how to type is very important. Many jobs need people who can use a computer. The computer has information on all states, cities, and towns. You can go online and learn everything on a place. After learning about the place you might even want to visit. There are also many places online to meat new people. You can make a best friend, online who can become your best friend in the real world. If you don't know alot about a specific holiday, or culture, the internet can help you with that too. The computer has many games also. There are so many to choose from and their fun. It's easy to talk to frends online. You can talk to them about anything and you don't have to pay a phone bill. If you have fmaily members that live far away, or dose, you can talk to them online too. If they live far away then you don't have to pay for a long distance call. If you have a webcam you can even see the person you're talking too. As you can see, computers do alot. The help us learn, meat new people and places, and have computers have a possitive. effect on people, or a negative effect on people?",8

My dream is to make sure that the regular faimily home wont be sitting in a chair, but playing outside in the fresh air. As you might of geussed, I know that computers will weaken familys and their health. Computers are handcuffs keeping me inside wich sustains me from getting outside. Computers are the greates distractions from family and friends, leading to bad relationships. Finaly these usless boxes trap you at home not in the world where we can help the enviorment.

2086,"Computers are fountain or knowledge in which the human race has drank from for many years. Some argue that computers are not food for society but they are wrong became they don’t look at the big picture. Computers help society in many ways, two main ways is that it promotes social life and it in as easy way to obtain knowledge about anything in the world. Computers promote social life through ""chat sites"" and other things of the sort. Some popular chat sites are @CAPS1, chatterbox, and chitchat. These sites allow you to talk to your friend without having to waste money and minutes on the phone. Chat sites also help you make more frienfs through friend finder applications. recent studies show that @PERCENT1 of people on chat sites make more than @NUM1 friends per month! There are also other kinds of chat sites such a @NUM2 where you can find the love of you life! When my mother was @NUM3 she met her husband through @NUM2 and now we live in a castle with a.

Through the computer at a click of a button you can know all about the catastrophee of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fun @CAPS4 @LOCATION1 even if you weren't alive at the time! When my brother had to do a project on the flying spaghetti monster he went to the computer and at the click of a button started reading up on the religion straight away. Recent tests show that @PERCENT2 of people that we a computer for research get it more efficiently and in a timely manner than those who don't.

2087,"@DATE1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, I remember when my cousins first moved to @LOCATION1. We were concerned that we would lose touch. The four of us were always close. So, when @CAPS5 happened. We no longer needed to worry about drifting apart. That is why computers have a positive effect to the public. Surely you've heard of online communities, such as @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7. These websites allow you to connect with people you @MONTH1 not always see. Certainly that helps people who have moved away up to date with friends and family. When someone has that closeness they feel happier. This general happiness leads to a better society. Secondly, computers are educational. By using them you can develop a more advanced hand eye cordination skill. Another example is that computers help you do research. If you have a science fair project, a computer makes research easier. @ORGANIZATION2 helps millions of people everyday. Yet another reason is that computers can be very useful. Like stated earlier, they assist you in doing research. Also, using this technology can help organize your documents. Essays can be written on programs like @ORGANIZATION1. Certainly that would help in school. To conclude, computers are positive technology for society. Social networks unite families. Research is made easier for everyone. Lastly, they simply help you. This is why I say that modern technology is a wonderful gift to society.",8
2088,"I think that computers have a good effect on people for many reasons. First, they teach hand eye coordination. Next, they give people a easier way to learn about far away places. Lastly, they alow people to talk online to other people. First, computers teach hand eye cordination because using a mouse dose it. Also, as simple as it sounds, using hand eye coridnation is very important. Hand eye condnation is a skill that is nearly impossible to live without. @PERCENT1 of people say that computers help with hand eye cordination. Some computers also have special games just to improve hand eye coridnation. Plus hand eye coridination helps you with many things like; sports, school, and even basic everyday stuff like throwing something away. Another reason why computers are important is that it gives people opportunities to learn about far away places and people. Having computers is like having a world wide history, science, and math book at you finger tips. When I mforgot something at school. I know I always had my computers so that I could upload my assiment. In my school we are learning about @LOCATION1 and with computers we were able to look up everything from what kind of food they are to were they would hold secret meetings. Computers help us study and learn about other country's easily. Lastly, computers alow people to talk to other people online @PERCENT2 of teens they talk to all theyre friends online. Having the ability to talk to other people online is a very good luxuary. Other countries are still trying to develope the software to even make computers and since we have already done all that why take them away? Plus being able to talk to jeny so you can get the homework you missed will really help. So in conclusion, having computers is a privelege that we should take advantage of. They teach hand eye coridnation, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and people, and even alows people to talk to one in other. I demand that computer stay a positive use of line and are continued to be used the right way.",9

2090,"Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I heard you guys are talking about how people spend to much time on the computer than excercising, enjoying nature, spending time with familys and friends, I think that is wrong to but let me tell you three reasons why it is good to spend time on the computer. The three reasons are why it is good to spend more time on the computer, what does the computer do to your study's and how the computer helps you in life. It is good to spend more time on the computer because a lot of people around the world even adults use computers to help search for websites on the computer for their needs and kids search for games or even history on the computer for their school work or to just spend time looking at the pictures. Thats why kids spend more time on the computer than spend time outside or with their parents. Parents got to understand that the computer is to study and raise for a living not to play games, if the kids spend so much time on the computer playing games than fine you can complain take then off the computer and tell them thats enough computer for one day but if there doing something interesting like geographics way on the internet or then you can let them go and enjoy helping them or just watch and see what they are doing on the computer, so if they need you can help them with stuff. The computer is for studys not for games the computer is a high technology system to help us with our needs. The computer is good for studys and if you are complaining about the time they are spending on the computer then let them go because you should if they are playing or just studying for a project or a quiz because the computer will help them in life and if you take that a way from them then they will struggle when they get to high school or even collage. I suppose so thats why you parents should let them study on the computer than you helping them you might say some answer wrong they check on the internet they don't know wich one to believe so let them by themselves it willbe easy work for you parents out there. The computer helps you in life by giving you the education for the real world when you go to work a computer then they might think he is a smart guy on the computer than the parents will be proud so thats why the computer is important. So I think the local @CAPS1 letter should take this saying underedvisment for you.",9
2092,"Dear, local newspaper, I am writing to you because I've recently heard that experts are concerd that people arent spending time outside enjoying nature. Also not interacting with family and friends. And they computers are no good but I disagree with this some kids like myself go on the computer to find fun group games to play outside. Some people who dont have computers still dont exercis or go out side. And my last reason I disagree is because some people dont live near any one in there family so they use the coumpter to keep in contact. My first reason why I disagree with the expers that say people with computers dont exercisi or go outside is, many kid like me and my sister get board easily. So we go on the computer and look up fun games we can play outside with the kids in the neighboorhood. I have a computer and I spend most of my time outside play fun games. Most people dont have computers and most likley they dont exercisi either, would you agree? My second reason why i disagree with experts is some people dont have a computer and they dont go outside. They would rather watch some show on tv. Then play outside in the sun running around playing with other kids. Its not just computers it tv, movies, dvds, cds all the games system they beep them inside. But many people need coumpters also. Local newspaper my third reason why i dont agree with experts when they say they don't interacts with friend or family is because some people dont live by family or some friends have moved away. Newspaper you @MONTH1 not know this but some people have cameras on the coumpter and you can talk to some while looking at them and you dont have to type and it better to see a friend/family member then just hear these voice. These are my three reasons why i disagree with the experts. Get game ideas, some people dont have one and still dont go outside, family easier to talks to an compter so please local newspaper agree with me on this computer subject.",9
2093,"Computers are one of the worlds most important peices of technology. They benefit our lives in many ways, but yet some people don't think that. I am not one of them. Computers are a great peice of technology because you can learn more easily, talk with your friends, and you can get things you want easier. Computers make learning much easier. Now most of our textbooks for school are online. Now students don't have to worry about forgetting books at home, or lugging around @NUM1 + pound backpacks. Also, for people who aren't in school, you can look information up online. This not only saves you a trip to a library or book store, but would also save money on gas or the cost of a book at a bookstore. That is how computers make learning easier. Computers are also useful because you can talk and socialize with your friends easier. You can show your friends pictures with the click of a button, that normally they would have to go to your house to see. You can also go into chat rooms with several of your friends. This saves the time of calling each friend individually when trying to make plans or sharing info. That is how computers make socializing with friends easier. Finally, because of computers, we can get things we want a lot easier. Suppose there is a item you need to replace in your home, but no stores have the one you want in stock. Instead of going through the hassel of going from store to store searching for it, you can just hop on your computer and select from thousands of choices. You can also save money, because often internet prices are cheaper than the store's price. You also don't have to worry about large items fitting in your. The item will be delivered to your home, and you can even get assistance to set it up. How convienient is that? Computers are a great convienience. Even though they @MONTH1 keep us away from nature, we have to make that choice ourselves computers are great because they make learning easier, make socializing easier, and make getting things you want easier.

Now a days I think that they are all just on those computers and are emailing, or I.M.ing, or playing some stuiped computer games.

Many experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. People are becoming adicted to computers. Therefore, people are spending to much time on computers and not exercising. Almost @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS1 are obease. These people don't go out and excercise. Obeasity is a major problem affecting many people. When people spend time on computers they become addicted and don't want to go out to excersise. Excersising at least @NUM3 hours a day is essentional for a human body. Being on a computer for too long can damage the way people think. Studies show that @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people that spend everyday on a computer are not able to concentrate. Computers can also damage the ability to see. Many people have told you not watch t.v. up close but whats the difference with looking at a computer up close. Light that comes froma computer goes directly to the humans eye. This can damage a persons carnia ( a layer over the eye) and make it harder for people to see. All though people have computers, computers shouldn't be used a lot. There are so many wonders in the world. For instance the worlds nature. People miss out on this because they are to bessy on doing work home on their computers. Now people can e-mail work from work to home. People get distracted and never take a vacation. With on week someone can visit another country and get to know it. Nature helps calm down a person from to much stress just like yoga does. Statistices show how people can calmthemselves from just getting to know a place that is natures. People that spend time on their computer look at pictures from other places instead of visiting the place. Not only are computers pulling people away from nature but also from their family and friends. Two out of three people live far away from their family. Computers are getting people distracted from getting together as a family. On computers people can chat but what if the other person doesn't know how to write or read. Visiting is a better way to get to see a family member. You get to see them personally and remember their faces. When you have a friend you usually get seperated during college. During college brake you can visit a friend to know what is happening and what charged. No matter how computers become it wilol never be better than a human. Life might be cheaper is you spend it on computers. Instead of paying a trip you can talk on the internet and instead of paper you can save it on a hard drive. Computers aren't everything in the world. Before computers were invented families were closer and had a better relationship also people knew the contrymone. I hope people react and spend less time on their computers. There are many beauties in the world that humans are ment to see so don't spend it on an electronic that can hurt you.",11

But when your on the computer all day you can't enjoy any of those things because you are to concerned whats on that monitor. You can miss out on whatching movies, going to exciting places, and even parties because you are to busy playing games on the computer. When your on the computer all day you can miss the thing that really make you happy. Exercise is very important in a healthy life style but do you get exercise when your eating chips and chating with a friend? I didn't think so. When you don't exercise you can become obese. Twenty percent of kids that spend more than an hour on the computer are obese and don't get enough exercise. When you spend hours on end using the computer it cant be healthy. Also when you use the computer to much you can end private chat rooms. You can meet people that are friends but you can met people who pretend to be your friend. The people are called online predators. They pretend to be your friends and if you believe them for too long they can ask you if you want to meet. This is a very bad mistake because if you go you can be abducted or kidnapped. So dont meet someone without telling a parent or gaurdian. Because you can be abducted. When your in a chat room you have no way of knowing of the person when you are talking to is really your friend or someone who wants to hurt you. And if you spend less time on the computer you can mind the chances of happening to you. So dont let your life pass gone by and spend time with your family, get exercise and stay away from chat rooms if you really know who you are talking to. These are the three of many reasons why you should spend more time with your family.",8
2097,"Dear @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 editor, @CAPS2 residents here in @LOCATION2, @STATE1 are split between whether or not advances in technology @CAPS2 have a positive or a negative affect on @DATE1's society. However, I strongly agree with those who have stated advances in @DATE1's technology are crucial for even survival. To test this, computers can allow for communication with others, further education, and even teaching hand eye coordination. To begin, in most cases, relatives and friends @MONTH1 live far away from same citizens. They can't constantly visit or call each other every - day. @CAPS8, what do they do? Easy solution: each person hops onto the couch, grabs their @CAPS3 computer, opens @CAPS4, and chats away. Similarly, I have relatives and friends who live in @LOCATION1, @CAPS8 I don't always see them. Without computers, I wouldn't be able to talk to my best friend @PERSON2, or my cousins @PERSON3 and @PERSON1. Thanks to @CAPS5, an instant messager website, and @CAPS4, we wouldn't be able to keep up with what happens daily in each other's lives. Also, @PERCENT1 of most @CAPS7 use the computer to talk with their family and friends daily. Apparently, computer usage for talking with friends and family was become a necessity. In addition, computers are required even for education. @DATE1's students of @LOCATION3 are basically all using computers for online college courses, (like my brother @PERSON4 who goes to @ORGANIZATION1), help with homework, and even for researching places around the world, like @LOCATION4, for that history assignment are next week. A teacher at @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""In @DATE1's world @CAPS2 colleges are too far away and @CAPS2 students don't want to travel too far away. @CAPS8, they just go online to our website and type away at all of their essays and tests and quizzes.""@CAPS8, computers are the most turned to device for educational research and homework topics. Finally, there are educational games on websites such as, pbskids.org, for yourger children to teach them hand-eye coordination, and subjects to get them @CAPS9-@CAPS10 ready such as learning to count and singing their ""@CAPS11's"". Teaching these subjects is important because the younger the kid is that you hach, the more likely they are to grasp the subject and continue to learn more efficiently. to conclude, advances in @DATE1's technology (computers) is a necessity for all learning and future education. @CAPS8, what are you waiting for? Grab your @CAPS3 or @ORGANIZATION2 laptop or even your bell computer and let's get educated!",11
2098,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 are very beneficial to our society. They help us with Hand-eye coordination, Allow people to learn about for away places, and if a sibling or friend is away places, and it a sibling or friend is out of town. No problem you can talk online. Hand eye coordination is very helpful it makes it easier to type for those monster papers you hear all about from college students. It also makes it easier to play sports like baseball or football. Have you ever tried to catch a baseball without your eyes and hands coordinating? It's like trying to catch a scared grease pig, almost impossible. Sewing requires lots of Hand eye coordination so when your in @CAPS2-@CAPS3 you'll be glad you took those computer lessons. With @CAPS1 you can go anywhere with @ORGANIZATION2 you can visit steamy @CAPS4, @PERSON1 beaches, and the tallest peak of any mountain. You learn about everything and just at the click a mouse. When you have to get information for an essay paper where do you go? Thats right your computer you find out everything there. Can you imagine teachers used to look things up in books. Now all you need to do is type in you search term and click enter. Easy as pie. When your friend is out of town or your parent or sibling don't you wish you could talk to them. Well you can just go to you video laptop and get on there and talk away. Don't you hate it when you forget to write down a piece of @CAPS5 well now instead of missing that huge @CAPS5 assignment. Just get on your email and ask a friend. Don't you get tired of hearing your parents yell at you for their telephone bill. Well not anymore you can chat with a friend to meet up for sodas anytime now. So obviously @CAPS1 are very important you learn Hand eye c coordination, you learn about places every where and you can talk to familey and friends anytime, anywhere.",8
2099,"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to inform you about the issue we are all having questions about on computers. I am a student, however, I do understand how much useful computers can be to future generations. The internet allows us to gain world @CAPS2, allows interaction with family and friends from different place, and it's a great source for education. I hope that after reading this letter, you will agree with me not only as a student but as adult as well. Computers are not only used for games and fun or even chatting with friends but it give future adults the world @CAPS2 they need to gets good jobs, maybe even form alliances with other countries. As a student, I often use the internet to provide me resource on whats is happening all over the world, not only about what is happening on the state or around @LOCATION2. Going to sites like @CAPS3.com, @CAPS4.com, etc gives everybody on edco or  of what different countries are having a crisis about or how they are building good with neigboring countries, even with @CAPS5.S.D the international headlines are a key source of @CAPS2 that does appear on some the internal vast varily of what is happening currently or live in the world with, headlines and even more without would @CAPS2, we can brights only for but, adults today can a different the world, whether it's sharing being of author ; it makes is huge is pool. The internet not only allows us to gain world @CAPS2 but entertain. My father always gets currently through the computer they get to email each other and have some good times; it's the only way my father with her friend. people all around the world want to know about how their mother, father, aunt, uncle, etc are on another country or province. Recently in the news, it @CAPS6, @LOCATION1 interacting with @CAPS7 with the the internet. We get to @CAPS8 they are doing okay and it satisfied the close family and friends knowing that @CAPS9 can be used always in there are must keep our relationship strong and ; we have to use the internet for emmile or computer compare to internet will lives around the world. The last reason, the internet is very useful us for purposes. Computers allows people and to and to school. For handle there are used for accounting, kerring chorts and graphs. It allows us to do things than the hard way things. more efficiently and with accurate information work and projects are also done finished. In conclusion, it can be sad that with the it makes work much. It allows us to gain world @CAPS2 information with family and friends and for education purposes. PS you have it will make your country and future a bright. I hope that after reading this letter you @MONTH1 hopefully agree with my opinion.",10
2100,Dear Newspaper I think about computers more people use the computers everyday but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Because those who support advances in technology believe that computres have a positive effect of people and I think that is true because some people use the computers all day they don't do nothing only in the computer some childrens use the computers but they talk with others people they don't know who is them the childrens have a problems with the eyes because they are only in the computers and that effect yours eyes. Another things is the childrens met with other people in the computer but they don't know who is them that person want too met each other then that children go to that they don't know who is them that person adapted that children they can use the violence with that children they can call to the parents and say if they give don't money your children can died and that is the more problems in the world with the childrens or in the family. I agree with other people they can use the computer @NUM1 minutes or less but not all day I think the parents can do to go out with childrens going to the park others thing but not in the house and all dau in the computers I think that all the problems we have with the computers with the family and I think you too think the so please think that think about happen to the childrens and other people and peolple thing taht too they think is most better the do that to the family think that what I say effects to others people to use the computers all day please only think what I say.,8
2101,"Almost every family has a computer in their house lots of kids spend a lot of time on the computer, and not outside. Adults are also on it trying to email each other. People are on computers to much. Mostly teens are on the computers. They are always checking facebook or are playing games online. Those kids are on the computer and are not trying to exercise. The parents should have a time limit for the kids on the computer. They should be alward to use it if they need to look something up for school. Other wise they need to be outside running or out with friends. Kids are not the only people spending hours on the computer. Adults are on it too. They are emailing each other and seeing if they want to go out for dinner. Adults are also on dating websites. The looking at pictures and people profiles. Not that is on these websites. Some people need time off of the computer go outside play a game of football with their friends or just go play a game of poker to get off the computer. Computers can make people forget about exercise. All they care about is taking to their friends on facebook or going on the online dating. Many people are not exercising and are sitting on the computer all day. If everyone. like the whole country would be obease. Computers need a time limit on them. Once you are on to cons then it will shut down and there is nothing you can do about it. Those are some ideias about why computers are not good. Rember do you what your country to go obease.",7
2102,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 would you guys feel if your child was being cyber bullyed on the computer, or mabey someone you love such as a husband, wife or or a big brother or sister was now addicted to certain things on the computer because thats all they want to do? Well, I believe that many americans bday are even turning obese because of the computer, which is why I strongly believe the man made computers have negative effect on many people, for the reasons placed above. In todays life, the average american sits on the computer for about @NUM1 hours per week. This is not only bad for our health, it can lead to cyber bullying. Studies show that over @NUM2 americans are cyber bullied every month. This in turn can caused chain reaction that can lead to . For example, in @DATE1 a @NUM3 year old girl was @PERSON1 bullied on the computer it had and just couldn't take it any. Its easy to see why many with one on the fact computers effect but it is of things. The computer addiction. For example, many ader each the computer to example time passes it @CAPS2 thein to loose. Ther @CAPS3 and became @CAPS4. Their family they will be bery stressed out. @NUM4 out of @NUM5 americans will become obese do to the computer. While they are inside sitting their big buts on the computer the other @NUM6 are going for a walk or jog. Imagine what this will do to the @NUM4 americans in the long run. They will become obese and many internal problems will develop. Obese is one of the killers in america so if computers are contributing to this why do others still argue that we should have them around? It now or never this is the time for you to decide wheather or not computers are good for the human population, keep in mind that it causes addictions, obesity and cyber bulling.",8
2103,"These surely is a mixed view of the role that computers have on our society. A lot of people feel that they are something we can not live without. My personal view is that they are hazadous to society because of the lack of exercising, online predators, and lack of own family time. Hey, I say if america thrived without computers, there is no indispotable evidence that it can not happen again. Firstly, computers have given society @CAPS1 excuse to not exercise. I find it add that for the past @NUM1 years, when computers were first released, obesity has risen to such a high level to where it is a national concern. To say that the two are unrelated makes no sense. It's pretty much saying that hey computers have been out for @NUM1 years, land obesity has risen during that time to a very high extent, but obviously the two are not related. As you can tell, that statement make no apparent sense, and again proves that computers are doing more harm then good in today's society, @CAPS1 bad effect computer it has been giving to today's public is the easy access for online predators. Though this @MONTH1 seem a bit extreme, it is an issue that needs to be addressed. On social-networking sites like facebook, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, where everyone accepts friends requests and can list their hometown, age and gender, it leaves the option for online predators everywhere, and makes it that much easier to be abducted. Also, a new site called formspring allows for anyone to post anonymously on you ""wall"" saying whatever they want. Since you are never sure who is messaging you, it leaves the door open wide for an online predator. The increasing number of child abductions has increased since the creation of computers, again proving computer's dangers. A last reason why computer's are hazardous to society is because it has caused for lack of family interaction. You might be thinking, well i @CAPS4 my cousins everyday, so i'm actually talking more. What i mean is immediate family, mom, dad, siblings. Studies have shown that families are spending less time together. You have kids who play video games all day, eat dinner with their family, and go back to video games. Family ""talk"" time is no more, family game nights have pretty much been terminated, and even family movie night's are decreasing because you can watch whatever you want on your computer with the simple push of a button. The endless possibilites of computers cause for a lack of family time. In conclusion, computers have become hazardous to our society. Though i will admit they are in moderation. For the sake of health, safety and family, computer use needs to be reduced.",10
2104,"Dear Newspaper @NUM1 Computers are like a way of life, every person in the world uses them to chat with friends, write papers, and look something up. It was a great technological advancement. Computers make writing faster, the also make talking to friends easier, and they give people something to do. Without computers in our lives people wouldnt have vary much too. Taking away computers will lead to video games being taken away. Computers make our every day life styles a whole lot eaiser, which is why they should stay in our every day lifes. Computers make writing faster @PERCENT2 of people use the computer to write things like reports, or papers says a google survey and my teacher @PERSON1 even says ""without computers the grades would be chaos,"" computers are the answers to many things so therefor @CAPS1 should keep them in our schools, office buldings, and houses. In addition to making writing easier, computers make talking to friends eaiser. If you don't have a friends number you can email them or facebook them and get it from them, even if your a shy person and you want to ask someone got you can do it are the computer. You can also past pics of you an your friends, and do tons of cool stuff. In addition to making writhing faster, giving students the opportunity to chat with friends is great @PERCENT1 of students love the idea and so do my teachers,"" @CAPS1 love to talk to each other and make plans to go out."" @CAPS2 are last reason why computers were a great technological advancement is because what if it was raining and you had nothing to do you could go online chat with friends or even look up videos. When it's raining I usually go on facebook or on itunes as download music, without computers @PERCENT3 of people wouldn't like music as much as they do now say @CAPS3.com my friend lizey even says ""I tunes and facebook are great i don't know what would do without them."" I conclude that computes were a great technological advancement, because of many benefits it has to offer, it makes writing faster, it makes talking to friends easier, and it gives you something to do on a rainy day. I love computers and so do @PERCENT3 of americancs. They were a great advancement and i can't wait to c whats next in store for technology.",9
2105,"Dear local newspaper, more and more people are using computers, but not everyone agrees that they benefit society. The use of computers has greatly contributed to the weight issue in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 cannot find the time to go outside and enjoy the @CAPS3 air, and they almost never see their family or friends. Computers have a negative effect on people and must be used less frequently. First off, computers are a minus for @CAPS1 because they can become addicting and @CAPS1 people do not receive their much needed exersize. A recent study shows that @PERCENT1 of computer users only get about three hours of exersize each week. Which is far below the minumum. in addition, @PERSON2, a children’s physician stated, “@CAPS1 people think that computers are harmless to their health, but actually, when children sit at the computer for hours, fat is building up on their bodies, which quickly leads to obeisity.” @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1 displayed an article last week, listing the harmful effects of computer use. They are @CAPS2 on the top @NUM1 list of contributers to weight gain the country. A few minutes turn into hours, and then you are hooked. @CAPS1 never go outside, and don’t get the proper excersize. Although @CAPS1 feel that computers are helpful to society, they have negative effects on the body which can be hurtful. Moreover, computers are a minus because they take up @CAPS1 people’s time, which then does not allow them to go outside and enjoy the @CAPS3 air. Dr @PERSON5, a health specialist has said, “@CAPS3 air and the outdoors are crucial for a growing child’s developement.” @CAPS4 @CAPS3 air, they @MONTH1 grow at a very slow pace, and sadly enough, miss a part of their childhood.” @CAPS5 says that computers are mainly to blame for this issue, and in order to fix it, must be used far less frequently. Additionally, @NUM2 out of @NUM1 adults and children are only outside on an average of two days because they are emailing or using the computer. @PERSON3, a youngman, never went outside except for walking to the mailbox each afternoon. His reason? @CAPS5 was on the computer, emailing , gaming not enjoying the great outdoors. As a result, @CAPS5 grew weak and regreted going outside. One @MONTH1 feel that computers allow the average person to learn of far away places, however, they @CAPS2 take away from their valuable time outdoors. Finally, computers are minus because they take away time to spend with family and friends. CNN.com reported that families in @LOCATION1 are rapidly growing apart due to lack of family dinners and family outings. Reporters point their fingers towards the computers, because this is where @CAPS1 families claim that they spend most of their time. @CAPS2, a recent survey showed that @NUM4 out of @NUM5 friendships are lost over the course of six months because they never see each other outside of school. @PERSON1, an @ORGANIZATION2 school student claimed that she and her friend @PERSON4, didn’t speak for over three months, and never noticed because they were always playing games on their computers after school. One @MONTH1 understand why someone else might think that computers teach hand eye coordination, but really they only destroy strong family bonds and potential @PERSON3 lasting friendships. To conclude, computers have a nasty effect on @CAPS1 across @LOCATION1. They have greatly contributed to the lack of exersize, eliminate time in the @CAPS3 air, and loose family and friend time for @CAPS1. Thse negative effects must be known to the public, as @CAPS1 of them use their computers far too much. Please let the facts be known!",11
2106,"I think computer do not allways have a positive affect on people. I think this because some people stay on computers. It is very addicting to them. Using computers to much can also get you into alot of trouble. The final reason is because computers can reveal personal information. Do you think computers are bad? Read on and you will find out my opinion on this topic. I think computer can not have a possitve affect by it bring addicting. Some people actualy say it is there life. When something like this is so addicting it keep people on the computers. Sometime people even stay on the computer all day. The reason this is, is because there is so much you can do on the computer. One day I was watching a show and this women said thats all she does is stay on the computer. Then she had to get off the computer and she told her friend to go on and check her email. The women went on the show and the host of the show (@CAPS1) mad her stop for a while. Then she learned that, that is not the only thing. The second reason why I think computer does not always have a positive affect on people is because it gets people in trouble. There is alot of websites that you can go on to talk to friends that you know and dont know. So sometime people take advantage of the fact that they are allowed to do that. So they deside that talking about people is ""ok"". They can get into allot of trouble for this. Not only in trouble with your parents but legal trouble. If there is any bullying online this is know a ""siber bullying"". This is an affence that can probly go down on your record. This is all the reason that add up to why I think computers do not allways have a possitve affect on people. My reason are because they are addicting to people. The next reason is because it can get people into trouble. What do you think? Is it a possitve affect?",8
2107,"Today, I write to the local newspaper in spite of an unresolved issue. Should people be spending as much time as they do on their computer? A computer is a great piece of technology, don't get me wrong. But people are spending too much time on them. Did you know that the overage teen spends @NUM1 minutes outside everyday? That's nothing! If we continue the computer obbsesiveness, then our children could grow up to be lazy, fat, and not willing to do work. Is that what we want? It's almost sad that people will look at places online that are within driving range. If you want to go check out that beauty, then get in your and drive there! Two benefits to going for a hike, or going skating is that you get to spend quality time with for family. Family time is one of the most recommended activities because experts say that it motivates your kids to do better in school and will make them feel good. What kind of parents wouldn't their kids to succeed? Another big issue is that is you have a webcam you don't know what you could be getting your teen or preteen into. They could be going on the internet and showing or finding innapropriate pictures of themselves or others. A good way to stop this is to use parental controls. Your kids could grow up to be just a who sits on his computer all day. It's your choice on this parents of cranby, how much computer time you or your family use. You can make yourselves have fun, going on nature likes or skiing. But if you prefer to look online and get as family time, be my guest. Computers shall be not used as much as before and we will have a better environment.",8
2108,"Not everyone will agree with me when I say, ""Computers benefit society."" @CAPS1 this letter everyone will. Computers help you stay in-touch with friends, allow you to use online textbooks, and play games that help your hand-eye coordination. Jump on board as I tell you about the wonderful affects of computers. Everyone knows it is important to have a well rounded social life, and with the computer that is possible. Social networking sites like @CAPS2 allow you to keep in touch with friends what if your brother or sister went off to college? Sure you could talk to them, but being able to video chat with the help of your computer allows interaction to be exciting. Computers have many benefits in and interaction is just one. The @CAPS3 is at a standstill with polution and all the trees that have been cut down to make textbooks. Computers allow the usage of online textbooks; therefore helping us keep trees alive. I would deffinetly use a computer to look through a textbook the kill twenty-three trees for every kid in my class to have a textbook, written on paper. Also many teachers put homework assignments on school websites, so if you forget to write down homework you could use your computer to look it up. Computers help save our environment and kids who might forgot to write down their homework. Nine out of ten people will agree that hand-eye coordination is an important skill to have in life. Computer games allow you this skill. The keyboard or mouse allows your hands to develope movement, and the movements on the screen allow you eyes to develope strength. By putting the two together while playing a game you allow your hands to move what your eyes are looking at. This helps for a great sense of hand-eye coordination. Games on the computer can be challenging and make you have to use your mind also. The computer lets for many skills with just a couple clicks of a mouse. The computer is a very useful piece of equipment in today's society and helps benefit us. It allows for a wide range of interaction between friends and family. The online textbooks help many people save the trees in our planet, and lastly the computer helps teach hand-eye coordination that allows people to use these skills in everyday life. The computer has benefited our society in more ways then one and many people are thankful for that.",10
2109,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In this world today many people are either on their computers or outside having a good time. In my opinion, computers do not have a positive effect on people. They will take time out of your day when you could be doing something else. Instead of looking at computer games, you could be outside enjoying nature around you, interacting with people face to face or exercise. In my mind, we shouldn't even have computers. No matter where you live in the world, there is something @CAPS1 unique around you. It is nature. Nature is one thing in the world that never disappears. If you are spending your day on the computer checking emails or playing games you will never get to see everything that @ORGANIZATION2 has to offer. Another reason why you should enjoy nature is because of all the exotic animals and plants you might see. On a regular basis, you wouldn't see them! It would be great if you saw all the fenominal plants and animals. Especially if it is with your family! Although computers give us an e-mail account, I still think that computers are just ruining out time. You coud be talking with someone on your computer but it would be much better if you could meet them in person. You will be able to get to know the person better and later on get to be great friends with them. Another reason why computers affect your social life is because you won't be able to spend time with your family and friends. If you get really close to your family then they will stay at hotels for the holidays and the more they come and stay in @LOCATION1 the more money the town will get to pay for anything the town needs like a shopping center or repairs on the roads. Plus if everyone is on their computer, no one will be outside in the streets shopping and all the stores will be out of buisness and once you need a new pair of shoes, the shoe store will be long gone before you know it. @CAPS1 it is important to stay close to your family and friends. Everybody loves a great game of basketball or a heart-pounding match of tennis. Well how are you going to be a star of you aren't outside practicing. If you are on your computer all day, you won't be abe to exercise and get the things you need to be healthy. Scientists have tested the amount of people overweight and @PERCENT1 of them said that they played on their computers everyday. Do you want that to happen to you. No I didn't think @CAPS1. All of those people wished that they got outside with their friends when they were young. @CAPS1 overweight people won't be able to socially interest with people and that means no money for the town. @CAPS1 if you want to be a fat couch potato keep up playing on your computer but remember what they said. ""I regret this."" @CAPS1 now you have learned that enjoying nature, interacting with people and exercising is important to live a healthy life. If you are playing on your computer the the whole time, you won't make a living with yourself.",10
2110,"Take yours eyes of that computer screen and listen for a minute why waste you life @CAPS1 in front of computer screen. When was the last time you ate a healthy meal, went outside, or interacted with family and friends? I can tell by the looks of you that you haven't ate healthy in weeks. Expert nutriest @PERSON2 says ""@CAPS1 in a computer chair eatting junky foods can result in concicenqueces such as death."" @CAPS2 you even know what a threadmill is? My dad wouldn't eat in the morning and then eat pounds of food for dinner, @CAPS3 he got to be really big. Then he exercised and exercised and he lost @NUM1 pounds. That could be @CAPS5 you turn off your computer and @CAPS2 some push-ups. When was the last time you showered? @NUM2? Did you know that @PERCENT1 of the people who shower have a better life. They find parter and get more friends. @CAPS3 be healthy. When was the last time you went outside? All the cool, athletic people are doing some sort of exercise outside like hiking, swimming, and @CAPS4 climbing. Plus who does it hurt to get some fresh air. @PERCENT2 of people who get fresh air are the people who have positive attitudes and get promotions in work. And going out side and exercising can make you live longer. Retired @ORGANIZATION1 pitcher @PERSON1 says,"" @CAPS5 i wasn't a pitcher then i would of been having all kinds of organ failers."" I know that you talk to your family through e-mail and video, but that's not the same as seeing them in person. I can remember when my family from @CAPS6 came to see us. It was on of the best days of my life seeing there @NUM3 little babies and my aunt and uncle. @CAPS2 you spend holidays with your family? That's what makes it the happiest time of the year of course. @PERCENT3 of happy families spend christmas together and they stay out of jail, have wonderful jobs and love each other very much. Have you ever missed a family gathering like a picnic and felt ashame?",8
2111,"Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 is my belief that computers have less positive effect on people! Spending too much time on the computer encourages less exercizing? no one is outside, enjoying nature? Family and friends are being left out. These are the reasons why computers have a less positive effect on people. Spending too much time on the computer encourages less excerzing. This is why this country is high in obisity levels. People spend more time inside. People are becoming unfit. This is becoming very unhealthy! For the reasons above, computers have a less positive effect on people. No one is outside and enjoying the beautiful nature! A breath of fresh air be more every once in a while! People have animals to walk. Going out side brings less depression. @CAPS3 also bring happiness. For the reasons above these are the reasons why, computers have a less positive effect on people. Family and friends are being left out and forgotten. Spending time with family and friends builds socializing skills. @CAPS3 makes you more friendly. Spending quality time is what everyone needs, especially after a long day. A computer could @MONTH1 replace your family. Also, you could make up for lost times. For the reasons above, computers have a less positive effect on people? In conclusion, computers do bring a less than positive effects on people. Less exxerzing, is one negative effect. Staying inside all day and not being able to go nature is another negative effect. Friends and family are being left out and forgotten. These are the why computers bring a less postive effect on people.",8
2112,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think being able to use a computer is a good thing because you can talk to friends and family in diffrent contreys. You can also learn how to use technology. Also, with a computer, reasearching can help you learn about diffrent types of things.Have you ever wanderd how your family was and how they are doing when they are on the other side of the world? Well using a computer and going on msn, aim, or even facebook you can talk to your family and friends. This gives you an opertunity to find out how they are doing, and hows it like. Thats one reason I think computers are good. Using a computer helps people learn on how to use technology. Computers are part of technology. So if you learn to use one it will help you with anything else. Learning to use a computer is one of they easiest things. My last reason is that reaserach on a computer will help you learn a lot. For example you wanna know about @CAPS1. You go on @ORGANIZATION1 and type in @CAPS1, click on a page and read. You will find lots of information. Computers will help you learn alot! I really think computers are helpful because of these reasons, talking to friends family that live in diffrent contreys, learning on how to use technology and reasearch helps learn alot.",7
2113,"Dear @CAPS1, I recently read that there is a large controversy over whether or not the use of computers benefits society. I very strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people because they save trees, allow people to talk online together, and @MONTH1 give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. First and foremost, the use of computers is very green because it saves trees. Many schools have textbooks that are hundreds of pages long and with computers you can access the books online and you wont have to print them anymore. Likewise, many workplaces print thousands of pages of reports everyday, but with computers they can electronically save them and make them accessible to everyone, without printing anything. If you were going to write a letter you would continually have to re-write everytime you made a mistake. However, with computers you can simply make changes without having to re-do the entire letter. Furthermore, with computers there are many different ways to communicate one of the more recent forms of communication over the computer is video-chatting. This is when you can see each other on your computers screen and talk to each other. Also, you can send emails or electronic letters that travel much more quickly than letters. Likewise,  you can ""@CAPS2"" or instant message, which is your similar to texting. Another advantage to using computers is that it is very easy to learn about faraway places and people. My brother had to do a report on a country in @LOCATION1, and he very simply went online and found over one million different websites he could use. You not only can find websites that teach you about the country but you can also find the people or that countries very own websites. Furthermore, you can even learn about places that have disappeared, such as the lost city of @CAPS3. In conclusion, the use of computers has a very positive effect on our society because of how they help us communicate, learn places people and how eco-friendly they are. @CAPS1, some people with an opposing view point @MONTH1 argue that people spend too much time on their computers instead of exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with friends and family. Those people are wrong because you can learn how to exercise on line computer and you can interact with others aswell. The use of computers also teaches hand-eye coordination, a very important skill in life.",11
2114,"Dear local newspaper, Computers have recently taken @CAPS1 by storm. The computer has transitioned, and has alserations done to closer its technological perfection. Computers are a quick way to gain knowledge and even purchase items. The computers also an easly accessable communication device. Finally, the computer has numerous programs that can schedule a time period in which you use the computer. Might I say this invention is simply impecable. To begin, the computer is a rapidly quick source to earning knowledge, and even purchasing items. Without a computer @CAPS3 people would have to drive the gasoline powered moter vehicles across country to purchase an important item. Therefor, polluting the planet greatly. Is that what you would like to do to our environment? Computers are a fast way to earning important knowledge. One way is through the very popular search engine ""@CAPS2."" @CAPS3 people search through the @CAPS3 links on the website and almost always find there answer. One the most knowledable can understand that the speed of a computer is a valid reason to believe that the computer is a benefit to society. In addition to being a fast source to knowledge and purchasing items, the computer is an easily accessible communication device. With a webcam attached to a computer a computer transfoms into a virtual telephone. You can physicly see the face of @CAPS3 of your closest friends and family. Yes you call them, but why call when you can see and speak to person you with. A poll was done on every family in @CAPS4 and @PERCENT1 of @CAPS4's own a working computer, and @PERCENT2 of them had a webcam. A mother of two in @LOCATION1 once said ""my children would never get see there father who is currently stationed in @LOCATION2. If it wasnt for our webcam, and computer."" To finalize, the computer comes with programs in which you can schedule time periods where the computers accessible. The programs can shutdown the computer at scheduled times. Therefor you are given an amount of time to participate in nessesary activities such as exercise. Thes programs will leave you with enough time to do what your body requires. Lazy and out of shape people don't use these programs. Yes it doesn't force you to exercise but at that point the choice of exercising or not is up to you. Its very important to use these programs, one reason being without them you will become addicted to your computer and your life will become corrupt. To conclude computers are very benefitial to society. The computer has a very positive effect on people for reasons such as being a fast resource to knowledge, to being a way of communication, and even having programs the shut down your computer at certain times leaving you with ample amount of time to take part in similar to exercising. I want all to do what is best for them and use a computer. Don't be one of the only not smart enough to use one the most inevative, elaborate, inventions to gracefully equipt our society.",10
2115,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1, I read in TIME magazine that there is an arguement over the negative and positive effects of computers. I think computers are good for our society because it gives people news updates, teaches basic skills, and helps people to communicate. Interested about what's going on in the world, many people look towards computers for news updates. @PERSON5, a farm owner in @LOCATION1, live @NUM1 miles from the nearest town. She does, however own a computer without it she would be lost about what's going on. Millions of people would also be unwitting without a computer. @PERSON3, a scientist of @ORGANIZATION2, also feels this way. He conducted a study on dependency on computers and found that @PERCENT1 of people in the @LOCATION3 mostly get news from the computer. Would you like to be in a world where no one knows the news? I wouldn't. With unlimited applications, a computer can easily teach someone a new skill. @PERSON4, a sociology major of @ORGANIZATION1 took a survey around the school and found that people who read from their computer read more often. They also comprehend the information better. Other people also use their computer as a resource for learning. @PERSON6 @CAPS2, a businessman at @ORGANIZATION3 was told to learn how to write letter in cursive or he would lose his job. @PERSON6 immediately went home to his computer and downloaded a software that teaches different types of handwriting. With a new skill, @PERSON6 returned to work the next day and received a promotion. Computers are a fine addition to this world. Stayinhg connected with friends and family is important and using computers is an easy way to do that. @PERSON1, a current student at @LOCATION2, has a very busy schedule. His day consists of classes from @NUM2 am to @NUM3 pm, followed by dinner and @TIME1 study sessions. He is always busy when his parents are free talk. The only way for communication is by emailing. He can respond whenever he has time and his parents are happy to hear from him. When children go off and grow up, communicating through the computers is simple and easy. Furthermore, a recent study by @PERSON2, a specialist on family, showed that @PERCENT1 of people stay connected to their family with computers. These people are happy to hear from their relatives. As you can see, computers enhance many lives around the world by giving news updates, helping with basic skills, and help to communicate with friends and family. Technology is growing rapidly and other electronics @MONTH1 be bad, but computers are helpful.",10
2116,"Dear local newspaper I think computers are a good and reasonable resource to many sudjects. My opinion on the matter is that computers are a benefitial asset to urban living. The reasons for this are simple. They teach hand-eye coordination, gives access to learn about exotic faraway lands, are another recource to online comunication. One of my reasons is clearly, online comunication. Since most computers have an ulimited power supply. More power equils more time to chat. If you computer has a webcam, webchats are also an option. Have this give a visual of your chat buddy. E-mail messaging is a quick way to talk with friends. My second reason is one of intelligents. A computer isn't just a toy or entertainment, it's also quick learning experience. The internet is a door to many interesting, exotic, unreachable areas. An example would be if you had a project, the computer would have endless amounts of information. If your looking to book a hotal, visit the hotels website. My final reason is one of my most highly, recognized. Hand-eye coordination is a skill most commonly used. Archers need hand-eye coordination to nail targets the first time. It seems important to most jobs or activities. Basketball players use it to pass, dribble, and shoot. Hand-eye coordination is an assential, key point in the lives of millions. So hand-eye coordination, communication, and learning are only few of the many reasons computers are a benefit to the homes of our people. The time is now. Make the decision. Ask youselves ""@CAPS1 will this effect the future?""",8
2117,"Dear Local Newspaper, I Have heard that you are concerned that people use the computers too much when they could do other things. I disagree, because there are many things on the computer that could help you. First, find directions to a destination. Also, you are able to look up things that you need for a school project of life. Finally, you can interact with friends far away. as a result, I disagree that people should stop using computers and do other things. When you are lost and need directions, the computer can help. First, if you need to go somewhere and your lost go onto the computer. For example, if you are having trouble with reaching your destination, then go onto google maps and print out some directions to help you. Also, if you are going over to a friends house and don't know where it is, you would look it up on the computer. For instance, instead of using a map the computer prints step-by-step directions to your destination. Finally, if you are starting to drive and don't know your way around, go onto the computer. For example, on the computer, it has every destination in the @LOCATION1 which will help you get used to the city and roads. As you can see, using the computer is a faster/easier way to get directions and find your destinations. When reasearching, not everything is in books. First, you could look up videos, news, images, etc... For example, if you want to check a show or research things, the computer gives you a lot of results. Also, if comes in handy for school work. For example, you are able to type papers and research for projects. Finally, you can register for jobs and buy things on the internet. For example, for researching, you are able to buy tickets to a concert or and jobs. As you can see, using a computer can help you with research, buy things, and more. Interation with friends would be good, to stay in touch when they are far away. First, computer has facebook where you can talk to friends. For example, you can talk when your friend is even in another country far awa. Also, a computer has email too. For example, during work for parents, the can talk with other worker and get information without talking. Finally, it doesn't cost as much as talking on the phone. For instance, talking on the phone could be up to @MONEY1, when on the internet is doesn't cost anything. As a result, people are able to use the computer to stay-in-touch with friends far away. As you can see, there are many reasons why people should be able to use the computer. First, you are able to get directions. Also, research and look up thing for a job or school. Finally, to stay in touch with friends. People should be able to use computers more often.",10
2118,If think that people computers do not spend all there time on them. Some people work on there computers so those people spend all day on computers but they do go home and interact with there familys. What would we do with out computers? I know your thinking that we don't need computers but they do come in handy sometimes. There fore I think that most people do not spend all there time on comuters. Second I think that computers help a lot with bills finances and paper work. If you owen a bussinass and you don't have an computer theres going to be @NUM1 time's the paper work. My mom and step father owns and run's a truking compine and about @PERCENT1 of the paper work is on an computer. My step father get most his loads coming home on the computer that would be hard to do without it. I know your thinking that what if the computer crashed? That would be a problem then. I think that if you have a bussinas you should have an computer. Third people use computers in personl resons to talk to relitives in other states. I my self email my mom all the time becouse she lives in @LOCATION1 I only see her for @NUM1 month out of the year and the computer is one way we can see each other. I think that computers are good for people.,7
2119,"Dear Newspaper People, Computers are one if not the greatest invention ever. Computers help people with that work and schoolwork, allow you to talk to family members or friends, and you can even play computer games on a rainy day or if your not feeling to good. Computers are very helpful and very convienint for all ages. School students use computers for all kinds of things like typing up an essay or doing reasearch on the human body. Parents also use computers for work, parents usually if there a banker or a lawier always have a laptop on hand. Computers are also a very easy way to communicate with each other. Adults are always emailing each other about work or about breaking news. Teens and young adults are also constintly. Instant messaging each other about the latest gossip on facebook. Even younger children communicate to each other on club @LOCATION1, where they can chat with friends and play games with them. Computers are one of the best ways to communicate. Also computers can be used to play games like solitaire. On a rainyday when theres not much to do theres nothing better than a good old computer games. You can play with a friend or you can play alone, its just a great way to some time. When it gets boring you can just save that game and go and find a more fun different one. As you can see computers are incredible and could be the greatest creation of all. Because of all fantastic stuff. You can do like studying and working, communication with all of your friends and family, and for being able to play computer games or a rainy day. As you can see computers are incredible.",9
2120,"Dear newspaper, Computers benefit the high-tech society that we now live in. They provide hand-eye coordination, the ability to learn about foreign places and people, also talking with other people. Hand-eye coordination is a very useful skill to have. Having a computer can help develop hand-eye coordination. They allow people to look at the screen while typing. This is easier than having to look at the keyboard, then back at the screen. Also having your hand-eye coordination developed by using your computer at home can help with phyisical exercise. People will be better at the sport, for example basketball and they want to go outsidb and play the sport, making them healthy. Computers also help you learn by having the ability to learn about faraway people and places. This can help you with a school project. They libary @MONTH1 be closed, and you need information about a place solve this, you could just go online and look it up. This way you can learn new things much faster than just a book library. A couple weeks ago, there was a big @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 project on the @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 expedition. It was easy because all I had to do was go onto one website. The website had all the information I needed for the whole project. Lastly, computers have social-networking sites. Here you can chat with friends online! some sites, you don't even need. In pay, but you would to talk on the phone. Last night, I had forgotten to write down my was for algebra. I just logged onto my account and asked someone. They answered and it saved me from getting a. Computers are good for the society. Now that you have read this letter, I think you agree.",8
2121,"Computers are an addiction! The only activity this society needs more of is exercise. Our @CAPS1 should be enjoying nature and living closely with family and friends. Therefore, smash that off switch and go live healthy in the wilderness, with your relatives. A common issue the government has is addressing the community with health care reforms. The local scientist of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 has been researching a problem over the past twenty years. They have just made it fact that our has gained an additional @NUM1 million people to the obesity list since the @DATE1's. This shows on graphs and data an extra @PERCENT1. A huge cause for this weight gain of citizens is technology. The main reason is in almost every modernized home, the computer. A survey took last week says that many people are on the computer for more than @NUM1 hours each day. We can solve this situation by turning off those brain washing machines. There are many potential diseases if using a computer. As a result, almost @PERCENT2 of strokes and seisures are happening from this terrifying device. You might as well open the door and let them walk right in because by this way of hobbies you are treating your body with no respect. If only people would stop this madness and shutdown these computers to aid in the event of cutting down on the amount of patients that are in the hospitals every day. The wonderful open road! Explore what ever comes in mind because with a soul you have no limit. Don't waste away a perfect and excellent life on videogames and the internet. Burst threw those walls like a bulldozer sinking its teeth into the beautiful light and onto the other side, let there be no more darkness and explore what god gave you. There is absolutley no explanation for sitting in that awful room with only the glow of the computer screen leading your life into nothing. No excuses that I need information for my job or school. All you need is your five senses and nature to give every piece of and you @MONTH1 require. So shut that system dowm and lead your way outside where you will wander the true way of living. Spending time with your friends and family is based on everything. Do you think a life of meeting people and having a blast compares to that rusting chair in the corner of the house playing a game that would get you anywhere in life. I know it doesn't take five hours to check your inbox. Do you know how much families",8
2122,"Dear @CAPS1, I agree with you and how people spend to much time on their computers. I think that people waste their lives on the computer. I know that it is good to look up info on the computer sometimes but people can do that and quickly get off instead of staying on. Most people play games and watch videos on the computer for hours, sometimes people can be on the computers for days when they are addicted to it. I think people forget the importance of working out or spending time with their family. One day one of your family members can be gone and you can regret not spending time with them. Also you could gain weight and not lose any calories from sitting at the computer for hours or days. Sometimes its good for you to get some fresh air instead of staying locked up in your house for hours or days. Working out or excersing is also good to do to. You can lose weight or gain muscle. Even taking a break from your computer and going on a quick walk is also good for you. Interacting with friend of enjoying nature help you also learn things instead of looking up nature on the computer. You could see animals, birds, and newplants from looking at nature. Maybe you can get a guide to show the plants and animals. You could walk through the woods or a forest. That way you exercise your legs and enjoy help your environment by picking up garbage or cans that people left in the woods or forest. You could walk lift up things an dhelp the environment, and animals. That way you gain leg strenght, and help out nature, and animals in it. Interacting with family and friends is also a good thing to do. Instead of talking to people on the computer on some internet you dont even know who these people can be. They can end up being really bad person or somebody who could bully you online. but if you interact with family and friend syou know that they are good people, you know that they arent bad people or that they wont bully you. Also interacting with your family and friends can help help with your social skills and that can help you in the future. In conclusion interacting with family and friends, working out is better then staying on the computer. You can lose weight and gain muscle. You can save nature and help your environment, or from interacting you can get better social skills and spend time with your family and friends.",9
2123,"Dear Local @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that computers have a big effect on people. Computers prevent people from going outside, they becme lazy, and spend less time with their family and friends. No worries thought, I am here to explain the reasons more to you so have a better understanding on computers effecting people. First computers prevent people from going outside. I would think that people might actually want to get fresh air, but i guess not. By them having fresh air @CAPS2 makes their brains think better. also computers make them not able to play with friends. Instead they play games and activities online. All people should see their freinds in person, not just talk to them on the internet. Second, computers make people lazy. When they become lazy they dont excercise or which causes their body to become unhealthy. In fact, our country doesnt really need or can afford for people being unhealthy becasue we are known as the most obeast state. As I said about people, being lazy causes people not to eat right, well @CAPS2's true. People who are on their computers mostly just eat junk food. For example, they might be on a game or talking to a friend, and they want something to eat so they run to the kitchen and get a bag of chips because @CAPS2's quick and easy to get. When instead they could get something real to eat. Most importantly, computers make people spend less time with family and friends. They are on computers all day that @CAPS2 comes down to some not even talking or seeing their mothers, fathers, and even siblings. Now honestyly thats pretty sad to hear. People arent going to be able to bond with friends and family when their upstairs or wherever the computer is. All their be able to do is bond with them online which really isn't the same as in real life. So @CAPS3 again computers have big effects on people because they prevent people from going outside, make people lazy, and makes them spend less time with family and friends. Hopefully I explained the reasons well enough so that they will say something about @CAPS2 in the newspaper. Thanks for listening.",9
2124,"Dear @CAPS1: I have recently heard that you want to know what kind of effects to people think computers have on them. In the past a survey like this was never taken. I believe a survey needs to be taken. In my opnion, computers have agreat effect on people. First, they teach hand-eye coordination. Now days you need good hand-eye coordiantion for a lot of jobs. You also need it to drive a car. What teaches better hand-eye coordination than a computer? In my past expierences, I have found that computers, for me, are the best things to teach hand-eye coordination. Where would people be today without hand-eye coordiantion or even computers? In a recent survey taken in my town over @PERCENT1 of the people in the town say they don't know where they would be right now if they never got good hand-eye coordiantion from using computers. Even @PERSON1, a human function reaches says that if you want to have a good job then you need hand-eye coordiantion. Second, they give people the ability to learn about far away places without to travel far. This is extremly helpful because if someone is doing a report they don'tt need to travel to @LOCATION1 to learn more about the tiger. Instead they just stay home and use the computer do get all the information they need. Not only is it convient but it also saves you thousands of dollars. It you so much because you don't need to go far to find information about far away places. In fact, according to a survey taken over <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of people in ym town sya sthe computer saves them the money and of travelling far away. If you do want to travel, it can help money. @PERSON2, animal reacher says she always is using the computer to time and money. Last, you can talk to people from around the world online. Talking to people online can seen you thousands or more depending on what your job is. If you're a big @CAPS2.E.O. of a company and need to travel around a lot to meet people, you can save lots of money by using a internet chat room. Or if you're a mom and you have to stay home with sick kids you can still be at work online. Using online chat rooms you can still ""go to work"" and take care of the kids. It can even help if you got a flat tire on the way to a meeting. Just go to a internet-cafe and oyu can still use the intenet to be at the meeting. In fact, I use the internet to talk with my friends so the phone bill doesn't go through the roof. In conclusion, I believe computers have a greta effect on people. y reasons are: They teach you good hand-eye coordiantion, you can learn about faraway places without traveling and you can talk to people online. I you to see computers as a good effect. The future of computers is in your hands.",10
2125,"Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive affect on people. I belive this because computers are a way of communicating, traveling and people use them if they have a disability. First, computers are a way of communicating. You can get in touch with people near or far. Most of my family lives in @LOCATION1 and no communicate with them I go on video chats. It's just a good way to keep in touch with close ones, and be up to date with them. Second, people use computers for traveling. You can research on places to go, sites to see and transportation such has planes and cars. You can book hotels too. lastly people through a computer or if they are deaf they can. only type this helps doctors their work with disabled people to communicate with them In conclusion, I believe computers have a positive on people because they are used for communicate traveling and for people with disabilities ",6
2126,"Computors are a is to our society. They are absolutly unimportant, and quiet irrelbuent to the common persons use. Yes, I admit computors are easy for everyday work and is something to keep busy, but all this is preventing young children and adults to do what they have to do to be fit, have a social life and there are plenty more efficient ways to entertain ones self. Exercise is important! It keeps our bodies in shape and keeps us healthy. Computors is a new way of entertainment. This new source of entertainment is making children and adults lazy. Books when the common person didnt have computors they would go out and do something with or make fun outdoor plans. And the younger kids would go outside and play fun active games or play mental enhancing bord games. Due to the common use of computors people aren't getting exercise they need, and thats a problem. People of all ages need friends and a social life to keep happy or to have any encouragement or fun to be to do good things. All people need some sort of social engagement everyonce in a while. Even kids from @NUM1 need to have fun with friends and go out. Computors is stopping kids from and making actuall friends. Computors are a menis to kids who need companionship. Besides computer life there are a ton of ways to entertain ones self. No one deserves to sit and do nothing all day on a computer. It does not teach hand eye coordination. It only dumbs those real down to just clicking a mouse. And what if the electricity stops working? What if all we on was electronics? There would be nothing and people would go into a panic computors are just a and miss oportunity to children. In conclution, computors the healthy growth us physicall activity, computors keep kids and adults from actually doing somthing productive, and finnally, computers. Is not the only way of entertainment. We all need to step away from the computer monitor and yet a life worth liveing and remembring. Stop the dangerous cycle!",8
2127,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 first of all computers are great tecnoligy for the @CAPS2 industry because they give you something to do if your bored. Computers can let any person do what ever they want weather its talking to freinds typing a story or even playing games for fun. But its not a good idea to be on it all day long, every one still needs to go outside and play or go to the park with freinds. Now most of the time people sit on the computer all day and try to droid freinds. Computers are also like a mall online on sites like e-@CAPS3 or @CAPS4 @CAPS5. There is so much stuff on e-@CAPS3, but don't forget going to the town mall is fun to because you can go with friends. One thing a computer can do is if your waiting for something go on the computer most of the time you loose track of time another thing is there are some people that stay on them for hours and hours and not do much with there lifes and there are the people that use it in a good way by doing something for work or buying a stock or some money makeing reason. Computers also have places to find things if your stuck about something like google wikipedia or even dictionary.com to get info on things you don't know. If computers werent invended life would go alot slower. Do I use computers alot yes. Do other people yes and yes I think computers are good because if you band them that would make alot of people very unhappy.",7
2128,"Dear local news @CAPS1, I think that computers benifit people by hand I coordination, talk to people from a round the @CAPS4, and also learn things like @LOCATION1 having almost the biggest eartquake. Just thing you want to learn. One way people can benifit from the computer is hand - eye coordination so if some one tryes to punch you real fast you can black it. The gym dosent teach you hand - eye coordination. So the computer is the only way to get cat like reflexs. (Hand-eye coordination). And what better way to learn it than on the computer. Another way that the computer benifits you is that you can talk to people. It is actually a great feature. You can talk to people from all over the @CAPS4. So if you knew a person from school and then that person moved some where far away you can still be really close to that freind. You can be in a chat room with as many freind as you want so you can talk and it wont put any money on the cell phone bill or home phone. One of the greatest benifits from the computer is you can learn stuff that you've never heard of. Alot of people didn't know about the @LOCATION1 earthquake untill they went online and found out. Because if they didn't know how would they know what there are far charaties for @CAPS2. So what if they wanted to know how to adobt a @LOCATION1 kid. Well for starters they could go online to find out. And we can go online to find a great gym to @CAPS3 at. Wheather it is ""@CAPS3 out @CAPS4"" or planer fitness you can see all the recomendations so you dont mak a mistake at picking the wrong gym.

The worst thing though, is never going out with families anymore. @CAPS7 instance, every-stinking - day when @CAPS1 mom comes home from work guess whre she's going? The computer! But, ever guess what she's going on? Facebook, to update her dumb page! Even better, that's what @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 do in the @LOCATION1 @CAPS6, that's exactly why I fancy myself with reading, and during the @DATE1 I go outside, take a blanket by down, and read or take a nap. You should even try it one day, and get your glued butt off that nice, soft computer chair. @CAPS6, here's the question. Are you a computer person, or are you not? Because if you are you probaly won't read it, and you'll go back to the computer. However, if you aren't one of those people, maybe just maybe you'll read this and tell your friends and family to get off the computer and take a hike. @CAPS6, please do and while you're at it, lock the door and keep them outside @CAPS7 the day and let them soak in nature. Ok?",9

2131,"Dear NewsPaper, I am writing this letter to you because the effects computers have on people are lots of people like to go on computers to talk to friends, play games online with other people, and to do online research for school, work, or other companys these are my opinions. My first reason is to talk to friends people talk to friends online because if they don't see them anymore thats their way to communicate with them because they moved away or if they want to do something over the @DATE1 and they need to get a hold of them because they might not have a phone or they just want to have a nice long conversation with a friend because some people like to tell their closs friends about whats happening in their lives if they are getting bullied is having trouble at home the always have someone to to talk with so thats why we have computers to talk to friends. My second reason is to play games with others a lot of people like to play games with people they don't know at all or sometimes people that they don't know because they want to meet new people or try something new and people play games games just for fun and im not talking about games on the internet. Im talking about accual games like for example world of warcraft, counter strike source is a first person game this is another reason why people to play games online. My last reason is to do research for school or work sometimes you go for school and you need to do research on lets say @ORGANIZATION1 or you need to turn in an assignment for your job or your fired this is all I could think for now. I can't think of anything for this reason. I hope you could come to an agreement that computers are really usefull to talk to friends, play games, and do research for school or work.",8
2132,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 of all the things you can learn on a computer, billions of webpages, filled with information. Computers are very useful, and helpful in our day in age; people use them for fun, school, work, and interest. People rely on computers mostly for safety, connecting with other people, and educaiton/work. Humans coudn't be as intelligent without computers. Computers have a very big effect on people. Of, all the things computers can @CAPS2, protecting our safety is one of the most important. Computers can @CAPS2 many things with weather. Ther can help measure air-pressure, wind speed,and predict tornadoes, hurricanes and many more. And, not only @CAPS2 computers help predict the weather, they help show computer viewers the weather. Any viewer who has a computer, can go on to a weather website, to check what the weather forecast is in their area. Well @CAPS2 you know when you meet someone new? You're a little suspicious? and you want to see if they once where or are a criminal. Computers keep history of criminals, so you can simply type in their name, and a backround check of the person will come up. Lee @CAPS3 says, ""I met this new man in town, he looked nice, but I had to be sure, I backround checked him, and found out he was in jail for burglary, I made sure never to reveal where I lived to him."" Not only @CAPS2 computers help secure your safety, they can help you connect with people all over the world. Billions of people are one computers every day. So, everytime you are on a computer you could meet up with someone who studies something you're interested in.Next many children and adults have family whom they live far away from, They can use the computer to find the relatives number or meet up with them on twitter or facebook. Kids can also find friends whom they had lost touch with. Computers obviously aren't a bad influence on the human race. Did you know students (@PERCENT1) use computers to help with homework? Many useful websites are there for students to help them through a tough homework assignment. Say, if @PERSON1 was having trouble with the word ""el sacapuntas"" in @CAPS4 class. She could go to a @CAPS4 to @CAPS6 dictionary online, and find out it means pencil sharpener. Studies show, kids who use computers to help with their homework get better grades then kids who didn't in a result of @NUM1. Many teachers also use computers to help them teach. They can find extra information about the section they are studying, or find games for their students to play: that connects to their subject of course. Mrs. K says, I am a seventh grade science teacher, I could not live without my computer. I use it for grades and for getting in touch with student's parents and much more."" Computers are necessary for learning. In conclusion, computers are heavily relied on in today's day in age. They keep humans safe, they help people connect with others and help learning. People aren't over using computers, because we need them to survive.",10
2133,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am @NUM1-year old student in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. Me being a teenager and all you'd probably assume that I love all of the new technology coming out recently. I am however, against it. Once someone gets on the computer, they wont' be offer hours. They are truly missing out on life. Computers users should have limits so that we as a country can improve our health standards, reconnect with friends and family, and protect ourselves from the vicious world of the computer. First of all, our health standards have fallen quite a bit. The obesity rate has gone up by @PERCENT1 in the past @NUM2 years. Admit it, our country grows lazier and lazier by the minute when we have new technology to do simple tasks for us. Such as cracking eggs for us! It is unnecessary! I've also noticed that not many kids go outside and play anymore. What happend to going to your neighbor's house and asking them to play kickball? Our lives have been sucked into a black hole that is controlled by a cyber filled world. Gym class @MONTH1 be the only time that some students ever indulge in physical activities. It is time to make our country healthy again just one step at a time. Our second step could relate to reconnecting with family and friends. Secondly, our lives are no longer personal. We share everything with everyone. Take my mom for example. If she wanted to reconnect with high school friends, she could easily go on facebook and type them a message. Sure that's easy but wouldn't it be so much greater if my mom wrote a letter. It adds a more personal touch to whatever my mom wants to say. I'm also positive that the receiver would much rather get a letter than a facebook message. The internet lets you reconect, but the experience of meeting up with the person @MONTH1 lead you to much greater rewards. Not to mention that the internet can be very dangerous. The world of computers can be very dangerous to the unexperienced eye. First of all, there are many cases of cyber bullying. Not only has cyber bullying hurt people's feelings some kids have taken their life because of it. It happens everywhere and it needs to be stopped. Secondly, people put up provocative pictures themselves, which can lead to stalkers or ridicule. Girls and boys can get kidnapped by other people because of this. In some cases, because of the pictures, two people will meet one will ask if they can meet somewhere and then they can get taken, @CAPS3, there are many many hackers. If you input a credit card number on a site, someone could use it to put even more many on the cord. Finally, viruses come around all the time, In order to clean them off or if you have to buy a new computer, it costs a decent amount of money, which you would not want to waste. In conclusion, I believe that people need to limit themselves with how long they spend on the computer, and what they do an it as well. I'm not saying that computers should be banned; people just need to be aware of what they do. Instead of spending three hours on facebook, why not spend half-an-hour on facebook and then go outside, play with their friends, and embrace the sweet scents of nature. Computers can be useful, when used the right way. Until then, we should try to put out a good message of staying fit, getting outside and learning how to do things for ourselves.",11
2134,"How often do you use a computer? How does computers affect your life? Without a doubt I would say that computers benefit society more than you can imagine for a few reasons. Computers help us connect to the world, learn about many different places, events and cultures and help to spread the word about events or buisness etc. To start computers help us connect to the world. This means that computers allow people to talk online with other people through websites like facebook, twitter, @CAPS1. etc. Even with people around the world, or to your neighbor across the street. This helps people and encourages kids to socialize with other people. Through many people can find or reconnect with people from their. In addition, computers also hold tons of information for children and adults like to find and learn about. The amount of knowledge you can obtain through computers is endless. Even teachers use the internet and computers to reaseach topics that will teach in school. The students also use computers to research topics they learn about in school. When a teacher tells a class to research something approximitly @PERCENT1 use computers and the internet alone. You can learn so much through computers. Furthermore computers can be used to ""spread the word"" about events, business and products. Many buisness use websites to advertise and sell their products. This helps to jumpstart and business which is important in our current schools can also have a website, to tell when scholl events are and what the homework is it you are absent. It is very helpful to the student, and teachers. On the whole I believe that computers benefit society for the reasons stated above.",8
2135,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, This letter is in regard to your article on how computers @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not help society. I am I firm believer that computers greatly benefit society. Computers allow us to learn about places far away, assist us in learning about nature, and allow us to communicate with people all over the world. Almost every country in the world has access to the @CAPS2. Their governments also have sites which we can learn about. Did you know that in a great study, a set of students were told to find the history of three random countries using the @CAPS2, every student was able to write entire essays using the information recieves. In fact, <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of all students have access to the @CAPS2. Your article stated that computers do not help us in understanding natures using supercomputers, we have technology capable of performing calculations that would take humans much too long to complete. This way, we can learn about physics, quantum mechanics, electricity and more. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of all synthetic elements were discovered using computers? In fact, without a computers ability nto perform advanced calculations in a matter of milliseconds, we would never know how these elements would react in the outside world. Now do you agree with me on the benefits of computing? The @CAPS2 is a great way to communicate with people online. It can talk to practically anyone in the world who has access to the @CAPS2. In fact, <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of users chat with other people online. In a @DATE1 study, @NUM3 adults were told to talk to someone from every country. <@PERCENT1@NUM4> of them were able to complete this task. By now you must realize that computers are a benefit to society and is a tool in discovering secrets of nature allows us to communicate with people and learn.",9
2136,"Dear @CAPS1, Have you ever thought @DATE1 how many children or young women get raped or hurt physically for chating with strangers online? or have you ever thought @DATE1 how many young children @DATE1 adults commit crime by meeting up with someone they don't know on enternet? Have you ever even wondered why your child scores so low on states test or does poorly in their academic class? Many children and adults spend to much time on the computer rather than getting their education and enjoying the short wonderful life we have. I believe that people should spend less time on computers. @CAPS2 will decrease the chances @DATE1 others getting raped or hurt physically, @CAPS2 will increase your childs grades in their academic classes and test scores, and lastly, people will be spending much more time with their family and friends. During @DATE1 a youg man named @PERSON1 was walking home from school in @LOCATION1. As he was walking home a fight had broken at @PERSON1 try to exit the large fight then suddenly a group @DATE1 young men who took part in the fight begin to attack him with a wooden stick. They each litterally beat with the stick, punched him with their fist, and stamped him with their foot. Each @DATE1 the boys begin to run as @CAPS3 friends came after him. @CAPS3 friends begin to pull @PERSON1 into the school building. As they entered @PERSON1 into the building, he sad was gone forever. @PERSON1 was only @NUM1 years old and was an honor student. A few weeks after @CAPS3 brutal death someone who was a bystander at the fight had video recorded the beating @DATE1 @PERSON1. They had past @CAPS2 up on youtube for the world to see. A few years ago a @NUM2 @DATE1 old girl and a @NUM3 @DATE1 old man met on myspace.com. The young girl had lied and claimed to the young man that she was @NUM4 years @DATE1 age and divorce. She and the young man had sex. The young man was sent to court and claims he didn't know she was @NUM2. Now the young man is frighten and nervous that he will be in a jailbait. During the mont @DATE1 @DATE2, a young african american girl named @PERSON2 went to harlem right after speaking to her best friend. She was sent into a building with a group @DATE1 guys her friend had known. These young men tryed to rape her but suddenly she had suffered from an ashma attack and heart attack from being frighten. @PERSON2 was my older cousin by @NUM6 years, her body was left in the building until late @DATE3 @DATE1 @NUM7. Dead at the age @DATE1 @NUM1, her young soul will rest on. Many children in the @LOCATION2. A scare very law on their states test. Many parents wonder are they get enough sleep? Are they studing enough? or should e support them more? Whats making children not want to study is the computer. Many children spend all day and all night on different websites instead @DATE1 doing algebra questions for only @NUM9 mins. The computer keeps people from doing what they are supposed to be doing. Some people are so addicted to the computer they don't even spend time with their families. If people don't spend so much time on computer they be more focus in.",10
2137,"I think people use the computer for many reasons. Frist of all because you get to meet People online and you get to chat whit them. My second reason is that you could find infromation faster. My last reason is that you can do a lot of things. I think many People use the computers. specially because they get to meet people. But mostly young People use the computers because they get to chat whit there freinds. you get to @CAPS3 them better. Theres a'lot of websites that people use to find freind. For example @CAPS1, yahoo, facebok and many more. So theres a lot of people send you freind @CAPS2 and they get to @CAPS3 you and you get to @CAPS3 them. My second reason. Is one of the most and reason I's because they use the about . So you go to use the internet to find that imformation. So thas one of the ways that People use the computers. My last reason of why computers are so important. Is because you dont only use the computers to meet new People. Or find imformation about what ever you looking for. But you could also do many thing. for example play games, @CAPS4 stoff online. But you could also look for anything you want to look even if you want to find a resepy. You see whit computer you can do many things. So those are my reasons why I think computers are so important. You get to meet new People make lot of freinds. You get to find a lot of imformation on the assigment they give you. And last because in the computer you could do many things you want to do.",8
2138,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think its bad for people to keep going on the computers because people wont get enough exercise, hang out with friends and family. It will also break the bond between you and you'r family, and friendships with friends, it will only happen if you'r glued to the seat and stare at the screen all day. It can be good to, for little kids, well not even little kids, adults to sometimes need help with keyboarding for at least one hour ady, so they all can pay with friends and chill with the family for a little. Whenever the kids and adults have time to practise, they, you don't have to do every single day, or not right when you get get home from work or school. It is also bad cause your missing out on a lot of things, for example.......... Sports, softball/baseball, soccer, basketball, you will miss all of that. Now about when a friend calls and asks you if you want to come over, because she's having a sleep over with a lot of other friends, and it's going to be school much fun! But your going to be sooooo much fun! But your going to say no because the computer is sure much better. Everyone is going to start ignoring you, no ones going to sit next to you at lunch. Soon your parents are going to benn you from the computer and say ""you can go on the computer no more, you can only go on it for @NUM1 mins, to only check your e-mail,...... you are going to spend time with the family and your friends, and going back to playing sports. The story is about, if kids and adults need help with key boarding then they can at teast go on for only an hour, if they have time. Finally, staying on the computer @NUM2 everyday can affect your friendship and your bond with your family.",8
2139,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers are a good thing to have in a household, so I agree with the people who support this decision. I think they are great to have in households or anyhwere, where the public can use them because they can help us in many ways. The ways computers help us are if we need to contact other people, you can do all your finances and things on computors and you can also play many educational games. Contacting other people on a computor is very easy and helpful. You could contact other people from e-mail, calling, text messaging, video chats, etc. But e-mail is probably the most common way. You would think texting or calling was but scientists took a survey and every @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people use e-mail for contacting people more often. Also on the computor you can do video chats video chatting is another way of talking to someone but also being able to see his or her face at the same time. Another reason as to why people refere to computers for contacting other people is because not everyone has a cell phone. So the only way they can reach them is by e-emailing. Now the list of contacting people could go on for days since theres so many ways you can do that but i'm going to move and the ability they have for educational purposes. Computers have so many different websites for educational purposes. They have worksheets, quizes, games, etc. Also they have all thoughs types of examples for different kinds of languages. you could learn how to write and/or read in different languages on computers. Sometimes my school teachers will asign us websites to do for homework(educational websites). Scientists figured out more students learn better or understand better by playing / doing online work for homework instead of doing worksheets all the time. So computers also make it easy for teachers when teaching a lesson in class and they have games and websites for it. If we miss days of school the teacher could also just assign homework for us to do so use could just check her webpage for that stuff, if we don't have computers then their'd be no way the teachers could do that. My family, maybe even your families too, we normally book vacations from the internet. We look for the place we would like to travel to then we find a hotel and book it straight from the web. The website already has pictures and everything you won't even need a telephone! Statistics show that every @NUM3 out of @NUM1 families/people use the internet to book vacations and things. If you book a hotel and need to get on a plane to get there you also have the ability to do that from the computers, too. Computers can be a very fast and efficant way to get things done which could be very useful and helpful. Computers also help reduce driving, it can save you money on gas. Computers can help you in ways you wouldn't imagine.",10
2140,"Dear Local Newspaper, I am weiting to you to tell you. My opinion on the effects computers have on people. First I would like to start off ny saying computers are a good resourse. Some adults use the computer to do taxes and advance check books. Another way the computer is used as a resource as teenagers who are seniors in and out of high school have to apply for colleges online. Others apply for campus jobs as well to help pay twoition. Secondly some people say if you stay on the computer long you'll lose contact with family and friends. Well what if you have a relative in lets say florida and you live in @LOCATION1 you'll want to stay in touch. Plus you wont be able to drive down there with gas prices what the are. Flying is an option, but its also expensive. Other times people mail letters but wait a long time for one back. Lastly people who have jobs want promotion. But cant take it simply because they need a high school diploma or they didnt the third grade. Well they could look online to find the best highschool in the state for a shot at that promotion. Alsp if people need a job they could find a nice paying one in another or in area. Thank you for your time.",7
2141,"Do you think that computers are a benifactor? Some people say they teach hand-eye coordiation, and talk online with other people. I dont think so, I think computers are a waste of time. You can hang out with friends, stay in the house all day and missing good times. Now reasearch shows that @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 uses the comupter. Now who has a facebook, myspace, or any social network? We all do. Now how many hours are you on it, two or mabey four? I think I made one point lets go on how computers are bad. When's the last time you went with your friends? A day, three days? Get off the computer you're friends are probly mad at you. It's time to log off facebook, myspace..ect and you need to go outside with your friends to play tag football, manhunt... ect. If you stay on that computer to long and avoid you're friend it's bad and you don't want to learn the hard way because you wont have friends. How about your faimly. The last time you're faimly was down you will ask you're self ""I'll go when I'm done with this level. ""You wont trust me you will get sucked into the game like a vacume cleaner clean your floor. That are that cant come out of the carpet thats you because the vacume cleaner is still sucking you in untill its all gone. Stop getting caught up in you're games online or facebook stop relax and hang out with you're friends treat them to diner and samthing. You jus have to get off the computer and go before someone is gone. Next step is you're missing. Did you miss a party latley because you were online playing a addictive game what about that high school reunion? You miss a lot of things when you are in a trance by the computer. Outside you see your friends playing football and you say ""I'll join them after I finish the game"" by the time you finished it is eight o'clock and everyone is in bed sleeping. You probably missed a fun game and you didn't get any exercise. Have you thought about it? Is the computer good or is it just getting in our way. Next time you're friends, faimly come knock on the door for you even if it's just to play football or hang out shut the laptop hop of the chair and be with friends and faimly always keep that in the back of youre head. I hope you got a good idea of what is happing to kids and mabey you so lets never log back on the computer again.",8
2142,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 my gosh that was so funny, and did you see what she was wearing. That was an example at how meaningless time is being wasted away on the computers as far as doing silly thing such as social networking, instint messaging, emailing and such more! Now dont get me rong if you do this for a liveing to support a family by working with computers. I agree with that @PERCENT1. For other indeviduals this is a differant case; when these indeiduals get no important over all benifit. I think every one can benifit by spending more on your time exersising one setting active. Also becuse when you spend less time on the computer then I think the counts of syber bullying would decrease dramaticaly. Finaly I think that over all it would increase family's to come together and spend quality time. First I think that spending less time on computers would be a good thing becuse we have to face the fact over a half of the @ORGANIZATION1 is obease. So instead of being on the computer its very smart to go outside and get some exercise, play some sports, and even if you have a dog take him/her for a nice walk. People dont realize doing such can benifit more than just you. Some of the people who support advances in technology. Say that the computer teaches hand eye coordination well you know what else going to the park and play catch with a base ball or foot ball (ex). Next I think that with less time being spent on the computer I expect there to be a dramatic change in bullying which can help also prevent the of sexual preditors becase this change would not just benifit children but every one to feel more safe. Finaly, And I think this argument is best of all. This will give familys a push to spend more time together. I know for a fact that the most important thing in a childs life is family even though one @MONTH1 not think so it is and if every family has a chance to do so than I think this will result in a better futer for every one. As you can see, over all I think by stoping time spent on computers. This will result. In family spending more time together. Less syber bullying. And going out and exersizing/getting fresh air. Thank you!",9
2143,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I agree that computers sould be used because of the cool things that it could do like you can get on myspace, facebook, youtube, and other cool sites but let get to the deal people used computer because it help them learn better and see everyting and you get to talk to people all over the world but for me. I like to get on the computer to check myspace on other thing but i think that people love to get on the computer because it dont matter if they do they exercising or not cause with out computers people will have to do a hole lot of writing but with computers. You could do everything i feel like people love to use computers in this life time",6
2144,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1. i am @NUM1 years old and a student at @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 I am writing this letter because I think computers benefit society. In @CAPS2 opinion I think they have a positive affect. in this letter I will tell you all the reasons why, so keep reading and I hope you fell the same way when you finish. @CAPS2 first reason is that computers allow you to talk online with other people. For example, when I go on the computer I meet new people that I would never met without a computer. Last week on facebook I found @CAPS2 friend that ive lost contact with and havn't spoken to for years. I have recently read on the internet that about every @NUM2 relationship started out by meeting each other online. @CAPS2 second reason is that it gives you ability to learn about far away places and people. For example, when I am assigned to do a project about any country, place, or people I can use the internet for help. This would make me know more about something and understand it better. A couple months ago I had a social studies project due on the thirteen colonies, without a computer I wouldn't have a clue what to write about. Having the internet makes everything easier. @CAPS2 third reason is that they teach hand eye coordination. For example, when I use the computer I dont need to look down to type. This helped @CAPS2 brain memorize the key board. With this kind of skill you would have more job opportunities. @DATE1, I was watching the news and have heard that over @PERCENT1 of the jobs now a days involve computers. Someone might say that they are concerned about people spending too much time on computers and less time exercising. However, I dont agree with this at all smart and healthy,people find a way to do both. For example, alot of @CAPS2 friend spend most of their time online chatting or browsing the internet, but they find sometime to go out for a walk or play same sports. In conclusion, I think computers benefit the society because they are able to talk to others online, learn about places and people, and teach them hand-eye coordination. I hope you agree with me reading this and change your mind if you thought differently.",9
2145,"Although computers can be very helpful, there are many negative effects that they can have on people. Chatting online can be dangerous, people spend too much time using them, and they cost money. There are many more reasons why computers can cause problems, but these are some of the main concerns. If you're not careful, chatting online can become very dangerous. Especially younger children that don't know better, using a website where you can chat to people can become an issue fast. Sometimes people pretend they are someone they aren't, and if you give out too much personal information, then something serious can happen. You can never know for sure who you're talking to, or what you might be getting yourself into. Many people spend too much of their time on the computer, which @MONTH1 cause many problems. If your on the computer in all of your spare time, then how can you get anything else done. Exercising is one problem. If you don't exercise enough, then you could gain weight fast which would bring additional issues. Also, being on the computer too much can cause problems for you in school. Since you're on the computer from the time you get home, until you have to go to bed when do you do homework? This can cause many problems. For example, your slip. If this happens then you might class. If you fail you might have to go to summer school, or even worse. Stay. When that happens you're parents will most likely get mad at you, and you your priviledges for the, even if you do. A computers cause many problems because of the cost. Computers cost a lot but then you have the paper and ink. Plus, if you have any teenagers in the house, they will probably want to have their in computer or a . If you get the to use it you @MONTH1 not even it. Some of my friends have a webcam and use it on a website they thought was free, but it actually costs extra money after a certain amount of days. With the way the economy is now, people don't have money to buy computers and all the accesseries that are wanted with them because it is not a necessity. And if you already have a computer then you know how much everything costs, and it can get very expensive very quickly. These are the many reasons why I think that computers have many negative effects. Chatting is very dangerous because you can never know who the person is really like. It can take up too much time and not allow you to do what is important like exercising or even doing homework, and finally, it costs way too much money and with the way the economy is. People losing jobs and not having any money, its no longer a neccessity. You could live without one, so why go through the trouble of getting one, and creating all those risks for yourself.",9
2146,"Computers have advanced a lot over time. They've gone from being the size of a room to practically hand held. But are computers always a good thing? Computers can be very bad and addicting. Books are @CAPS1 as good as computers are to find information. Think about all the computers hackers taht could claw their way into your personal information on the computer. Have computers really made a big positive impact on our world at all? Your mom calls you down for dinner, but you say, ""@CAPS1 a minute! I'm on the computer!"". Computers can be very addictive. There are games and websites on a computer that can suck you in, and you wouldn't even realize it. Spending so much time on the computer takes away from doing other activities, like exercise. Did you know that more than fifty percent of frequent computer-users are overweight or obese? This is because they like their computer's so much, they don't find any time to exercise. Is this a good impact to our society? When you walk into a library lately, you see more people researching on the computer rather than at a table with an encyclopedia or a book. Books hold the same (and sometimes more) amount of information as the internet does. People choose the internet over books because they like the high-tech feelig of the internet, or now they can flip to a new page with the click of a mouse. Books are more practically and you can't copy and paste words right from the back onto your article, so there's a smaller chance of copyright. Books are the better choice over the internet. You have @CAPS1 recieved a call from your banker telling you that all you money has been taking from your account. As you listen in shock, your banker explains that since you use the internet to pay your bills, someone hacked into your account and made a withdrawl. All the money you've been saving for years and years is suddenly gone. All because the internet is an easier and faster way to pay your bill. But the technique of ""hacking"" into a computer grew @CAPS1 as fast as the computer itself did. Ten percent of people who put personal information (such as social security numbers, bank account passwords, etc.) into their computer end up having their money taken away by a hacker. That puts a bad effect on people's lives, society, and computers. Computers do not a big positive impact on society. People become easily addicted, causing many problems for themselves. Using a computer as a research - tool can sometimes be more complicated than @CAPS1 using a book. Paying bills or using a computer to file any personal information can eventually make many financial problems for people later on in life. Computers are not good for our society, or the world.",10
2147,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has come to my attention of more and more people use computers, and less time exercising, enjoying nature, with family and friends. I personally disagree about about this opinion. In addition, not only @CAPS1 will affect of how people are attracted to computers, but @CAPS1 will also affect of how people have to work on there computers. If this opinion was agreed for the people, this will hurt our lives of doing variety things on the computers. My first main reason of why many people use computers but less time doing other things which is because of how people have to work on there computers for there job. There are almost about @PERCENT1 people that I've seen before that there doing different variety things on the computer, in the library and I've seen my father always working on the computer to print & send out fliers & checks his messages (e-mail) on the internet. @CAPS1 always happens to people because there jobs are slow, losing there employers, or etc. The final main reason of why people are using computers but less time doing other things to, is because of how people are attracted to use the computers. For example, there many people especially children and teens like to use the computers is because they can play games on the internet, listen to music, watch videos, write documents, or play games on the @CAPS2-@CAPS3 discs. This has accured for a long time because people or kids don't know what is wrong and what is the right thing to do. If you choose to use the computers for your entire life, ask yourself one or two questions, what would happen if you choose not to use the to help with something? or what will you do in your life?",8
2148,"@DATE1 @CAPS1 @PERSON1, I don't think that there is a single thing wrong with computers. They allow teenagers like me, to talk to family & friends out of state, without bringing up the phone bill. There's nothing you can't find on the computer now-a-days, and not to mention, all the cool stuff you can do with them. Just think about it, not being able to see or talk to you family and your friends. That would be terrible for me, mainly because I have a tight bond with both. Computers allowed me to see and talk to my aunt in @LOCATION1, for seven years with a webcam, how awesome is that?! It's the same exact thing with my friends too! When they leave the state I always talk to them via computer. Technology has and thats definatly @PERCENT1 for the best! Instead of bringing up the phone bill, & talking on the phone, just buy a webcam & instead of just talking to them, you'll be able to see them too! Just try it, look up anything & everything, I'd bet you'll find it. When I have to do projects, I can do them in a flash! All I need is google by my side! Since they made internet available on cell phones & iPods, I have that internet with me everywhere I go. I just find it amazing how much the world changed since my parents were kids! If I wanted to name all the cool stuff on the computers, then I wouldn't be able to fit it on the page, so I wont. But, you could buy your favorite things online, you can play games, and interact with people. Interacting with people is great, because you learn to make a new friend, while your in the process of doing just that! In conclusion, computers do benefit everybody. Theres so much more stuff they can do, I can't even name them all! So, @PERSON1, next time you want to talk to someone out of state on the phone, think about what you could do to save some money in this low economy. I know I said this before, but technology has gone so far, & is improving every step of the way.",8
2149,"Advances in technology would have a positive affect on people. Think about it, computers could help hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and allow people to talk to other people online. Computers would most definetly be a positive affect on people. As mentioned, computers would help hand eye coordination. This is very important when playing a sport. Baseball for instince players need to catch a ball that is trying at them they need to be able to catch it. same when hitting. Computers would teach people to have hand eye coordination and they would want to go outside and play, which also is good exercise. Think about this with computers kids would instead of being home doing nothing be outside playing a sport just because they were on a computer. Dont you think computers are a good idea? Also a computer would help kids get better at typeing. This is not only good now but when they grow up and get used if that job is being a consultant for a company they will have to do alot of typing. If the person is not good at typing then they probably will get tired. If the person had a computer then when they grow up they will be a better typer and not get tired. Do you really want to see someone not get u job just because there were no computers? Computers help people succed in the life and its is all do to computers. Besides, hand eye coordination, computers give people the ability to learn about farway paces and people. The computer gives people the ability to serf the web to find out cool and interesting details about places that they would be able to unless they had a computer, The computer would give the person a whole sheet or more of details about the place or even a person. I remember last year I was wondering what does my country I was born in look like? I looked on the web and sure enough it gave me a whole buntch of pictures and details about my country. I would have never been able to find that with a book. Also the computer helps with school. The teacher might assigned a paper and has have to use a computer to find the information. If has don't have a computer then you just that assignment. The computer helps students get work done in there house and not in a library. Computer help in many ways but if helps learn which is one of the most things. Finally, the computer gives you an opportunity to chat to people online. Some people have friends that they dont know number and so when they go online and chat with them they get the number. Without to computer they would have never gotten the number. Also maybe you havent talked to someone in a longtime and now with online chat you can. In maybe you cant talk about something but you can write in type in the computer can let you with one of your best friends and then you can tell them and feel much better about yourself then it all in, computer is one cool machine and not only will it let you surf the web but it. Will give a chance to chat online with one of your best friends. To sum up, computers are a sofisticated machine but would have a positive affect people. They help people with hand eye coordination, give people to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk to each other online. The computer at first might seem like a bad idea but if young think positive it will turnout positive. The computer would most defitely affect the people in a good way. In any case like this is there? Really a bad side to having a computer?",10
2150,"Now a days everyone has their own computer weather you share it with the family or not. People are spending more time on the computer then they are exercizing or getting outside. Most people dont realize it but they actually take away from family bonding time. I have to say they are helpful when it comes to homework. Since computers keep getting more and more advanced over the years, the games that you can play on them are incredible! But do you really want to stock inside all day on the computers? Instead, on the weekends or even in spare time, get outside and start exercizing. It is so much healthier to atleast go outside and kick the soccer ball around then to be inside with your eyes glued to the computer, playing some shooting game once you have been sitting on a chair all day and only moving your fingers around will only make someone lazier. Therefore they will have no desire or energy to get ou and be active. Do you like spending time with your family? Well, I know I love it once in a while. When people are up in their rooms playing games on their computer, they could be spending quality time wich their familys. Some people I know would rather stay in their rooms/houses or stay to be on their computers, but I know that I would much rather be outside with my family. Doesnt it get so boring to hear your family say how much fun they had and you werent there? I sure would get bored of ir. Next time someone says 'no' to some family bonding time, they should think about how much more fun it would be with them, then in your room. I have to say one thing, computers come in verry handy when it comes to homework. Say someone forgets there @CAPS1 text book at home, you can just log in to a website and there, your looking right at your text book but on the computer. If someone doesnt understand s homework assignment, you can just go right online and ask a friend how to do it, and instead of getting half credit, you will get full credit. I have done this alot of times, when you have to research something to understand it better, you use the computer for that too! There are plenty of ups and downs about computers, but I think that as long as you use your time wisely with computers, they come in verry handy.",8
2151,"Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, I feel that computers are a good thing for our society, they help us answer everyday questions and research faster, they help us communicate with distant people and they make school work easier. These are just a few reasons on why I like computers and you should to. See, computers help us answer anything due tomorro on @PERSON1 but I left my text book at home. All I have to do is log on to google and search his name, More than @NUM1 websites pop up giving me enough information to do my assignment. @PERCENT1 of people agree with me that computers are very helpfull. however, reasearch is not the only thing computers can do for you @CAPS2 you are a member, of a social networking site like myspace or facebook or have a program like oovoo, then you can live message chat with anyone else using the site as well. some even offer video chat so you can have a conversation face to face while your in texas and your friend your video chatting with is in china. Computers bring the world together in an @CAPS1 way. Surprsingly,there is still more these amazing machines can do, @CAPS2 you have programs such as microsoft word than you can easily create essays and add fun pictures edited on your photoshop software and use screening effects and animations to make your project come to life. You can get your school work done faster, and then when you're done just e-mail it to your teacher then you dont have to worry about misplacing your assignment. I hope my information was a help to you, computers are an important part of oue lives the certanly shouldnt control them and constantly keep us away from family and friends, but they help us so much and can make working easier and more fun! thank you.",8
2152,"Can you imagine a world without computers? People would have a hard time contacting one another, for business or pleasure. We would lose acess to music videos, and even games that entertain us. Most importantly, we would not be able to gain the knowledge and information a computer can provide. This is why I believe computers benefit society. As you know, computers allow communication. From email, to instant messaging, and even web cam chats. The computer is one of our key sources of communication. @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 own a computer. @PERCENT2 use their computer to communicate for their job. They send memos, questions documents, and general information using email. Without computers we would have to send these things by mail which is much slower, and costs more. However, computer, can also be used to communicate with friends for fun. Computers provide great ways to connect with others. Computers also provide us with entertainment. With computers we have acess to music, videos, and games. Before computers radio was the easiest way to listen to music. The only problem was you would have to wait for the radio station to play the sing you wanted to hear. But with a computer all you need to do is buy it off of itunes for @MONEY1, and you can listen to it forever. You could even type the song name in on @ORGANIZATION2 and listen to it free from a safe trusted site. If you prefer radio you can listen to live streaming radio from your computer for free! Computers also provide videos for free. You could get on @CAPS1 and watch someone pull of a crazy stunt or watch a new hit music video. Or you could head over to a sports network site and watch the highlights from the big game you missed yesterday. You can even watch episodes of your favorite television shows for free. Computers even allow acess to free online games. One of the best ways computers are used is to find information. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 experts say the internet provides some of the best information available. This includes recipes, facts, maps, stories, and much more. For example, if you wanted to know ""how to change a tire"" all you need to do is search for it on @ORGANIZATION2, and plenty results will appear. Maybe you want to know about the customs of the @ORGANIZATION1. Again, all you need to do is search for it to instantly be provided with more information than you need. Why waste time searching through a book when you could have it instantly. Hopefully the reasons I have provided you have convinced you that computers benefit society. They allow communication, provide entertainment, and give acess to information.",10
2153,"Dear local newspaper, Computers benefit society and have great effects on people for a few reasons. It is easier to type than to write, it increanses typing skills, and strengthens and helps hand and eye coordination in people. First of all, while some people find it easy to write by hand others might find it easier to type. It is more efficient to type on a computer than with a @CAPS1. Also if you use the computer it is faster if typing is a good skill that you might have. Some people don't know where they make a mistakes and @MONTH1 have to go back and. However on a computer, grammar and spelling errors are underlined and there is no erasing. You have to do just a button and your errors are fixed easily. The second reason why typing on a computer is better than writing by hand is it increases typing skills. People that have not used the computer can increase their skills.For example, where their fingers go and how @CAPS2 they can type. being used to writing with a @CAPS1 all the time it could be different using a computers especially if computers were not invented back in the day. It could be a change for People who writing with a than setting on the command using a keyboard to type. The final reason why computer is more efficient than by @CAPS1 is hand and eye coordination. People who have trouble using the computer. It helps your eyes follow the screen and your more across this keyboard. The wrap it up, I personally think that an increase in typing, being easier than writing and hand and eye coordination nuse you have to write something to think your and try using the it really helps.",8
2154,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people. Primarily, @CAPS3 teaches hand-eye coordination. This skill is very useful to every one throughout their life. Also, @CAPS3 allows people to learn about far away places and see what they look like with out paying for the trip. Moreover, @CAPS3 allows everyone to connect with family who live far away. As you can see, computers play a huge role in society today. To begin, computers teach hand-eye coordination. Not only will this skill be needed to use computers but allso durring every day life. Personally, I think that @CAPS3 is great kids start learning how to type at a young age. ""I am only @NUM1 years old and I allready have @CAPS1 typing skills mastered,"" said @CAPS2. That is very impressive because mostly elderly people don't have that ability. The reason for that is they did not have that type of technology. What I find interesting is about @PERCENT1 of people from that generation are just starting to catch on to computers. Actually, @CAPS1 opinion is just begining to understand. For christmas @CAPS1 parents bought her a laptop. Some times when we are visiting her I help to teach her. Pretty soon she will be sending out emails just as fast as kids @CAPS4 now. @CAPS3 is like she missed the train and is trying to. To continue, computers allow acess to the world. part of the day is spent talking and dealing with face to face. By using the computer you can see and talk to relatives and friends that live far away. The ""webcam"" is a great invention because @CAPS3 enables you to actually see the person on the other end. @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS3 is so cool to be able to see @CAPS1 grandparents. We used to only visit once or twice a year because they live in @LOCATION1, but now we see them atleast once a week!"" @CAPS4 you see the benifits to using computers on a daily basis? I agree that the amount of time spent on them should be kept to a mininum, but in @NUM2 minutes a day really going to effect peoples life styles that much? To summarize, computers are an exellent idea. They introduce new skills to children that can be used every day. They can put these skills to use when they are one get jobs. Physically you are preparing palm fox entering the work force. Also, they help us learn new information on just about anything. Research has became a ""snap"" in other words @CAPS3 is quite simple. Finally, they enable us to keep in touch with relatives who live far away. These amazing machines are our future, so why not embrace @CAPS3? Thank you for listening.",9
2155,"Dear Local Newspaper, I have recently heard that you are searching for solid oppinions on the effects @MONEY1 computers. Mainly, oppinions on whether they are good or bad. I know for a fact that the help computers provide has become an essential for most @MONEY1 the people in @LOCATION1. Computers provide entertainment in all catagories, including games, videos and so much more. ""@ORGANIZATION1"" is a search-engine on the internet that has @MONEY1 @MONEY1 links and addresses that bring you where you need to go. The website is like thousands @MONEY1 newspapers, phone books, encyclopedias, and dictionaries combined. Not to mention how much the modern computer helps at even the simplest @MONEY1 jobs. The computer is a neccesary tool for assistance in life. Most people think that computers are making children these days overweight. The computer does just a few more things than the television. The television has videos and movies. It also has the internet and games when a video game console is wired to it. If any case, televisions are doing just as much damage, if not more! I can guess that more than ninety percent @MONEY1 homes in @LOCATION1 have at least one computer or laptop with internet. A computer with internet is a gateway to various kinds @MONEY1 wonderful things. You can talk to friends through social messaging networks or by looking at them via video conference. There are hundreds @MONEY1 popular video game website. Shopping online has become very popular. ""@CAPS1 and @CAPS2"" even allows you to buy grocceries from home on their website. You @CAPS3 is a website where anybody can post videoes about anything! All these different helpful and entertaining tools have been said, but I haven't even talked about the number one! @ORGANIZATION1 is a website where you type in something, for instance, ""video game"", and thousands @MONEY1 results will pop up with websites, advertisements, maps, definitions, videos and other things. You name it and @ORGANIZATION1 has it. @ORGANIZATION1 is the number one most famous website in the world. It make @MONEY1 a year from around the world. @ORGANIZATION1 buys, sells, has videos, pictures, maps, links, advertisments, e-mails, recipies, phone numbers, measurements, translations, definitions, and so much more that if I continued I would have gone about three more lines down. @ORGANIZATION1 is amazing. After reading about my point @MONEY1 view on computer, I hope that you can now see through my eyes. Computers are efficient, helpful, entertaining, and just plain awesome.",10
2156,"Dear ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,"" Some experts believe that computers persuade people to stay indoors, and not go outside to play. I do not agree with this. First of all using computers is the number one way to communicate. Secondly, reading or watching @CAPS3 on line could be more helpful then reading a newspaper. Lastly, games people play on a computer are fun, but they can @CAPS4 help with a persons hand-eye coordination and reflexes. These are three ways that computers have a positive effect on people. When @NUM1 people were surveyed @PERCENT1 of them said they used the computer to communicate with friends, family, and coworizers. One way to communicate online is e-mail. E-mail is used everywhere for sports teams, jobs, school, etc. My mother can't go a day with out checking her e-mail. On her email is @CAPS3 about me and my brothers sports, our school, my family, and my mom's job. Email is mainly used by aduldts. Kids, such as myself, use social networking sights. For example: facebook, twitter, and myspace. I have a facebook and it is so helpful. I'm able to communicate with friends with out having to call them. Some of my friends don't have phones, so facebook is where I get to talk to them. Computers are useful for communication, but @CAPS4 for learning about local, national, and world @CAPS3. Going out to buy newspaper can be a. The cost of them can start to add up, and it @MONTH1 not always give people the information they want. Reading @CAPS3 online is so much simplier. It is extremly easy to go to a website that has @CAPS3 and find a topic you want to read about, @CAPS4, there are vidios and color pictures on a computer that there aren't in a newspaper. Looking at pictures is a great way to get more out of an article. If somebody is reading an article, but can't picture what happened in their heads, photos are helpfull. Vidios are a fun and easyway to learn @CAPS3. There is often more information in a vidio than there is in an article. Reading @CAPS3 on the computer is only one way computers benifit society. The games on computers can be fun and helpful. Experts say that a person who played a game on a computer once a day for a month increased their hand-eye coordination by @PERCENT2. Just imagine if somebody did that for an entire year! I admit, some games don't help people as much as others but the ones that do can be so helpfull. One game that helps a person think is called mind-sweeper. In this game people of all ages are challanged to find the mines hidden in an area. This helps people pay attention and think carefully about what they are clcking. Playing games on a computers can aid someone if they would like to have better hand eye coordination or reflexes. Computers benifit society because they are the number one way people communicate, they are convinient when it comes to reading @CAPS3, and games on a computer can help with hand-eye coordination. I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people.",10
2157,"My opinion about computers is that they help society stay up to date with their surroundings, Computers also allow us to stay in touch with family and friends and stay update with the local and global news. Its not the computers fault people wont go outside. Researchers claim ""computers are one of the main reasons for obesity and other health deffects."" I would like to know how is it the computers fault. It does not breath, I does not sleep, it doesn't eat. I has no organs. So how does the computer control the use? It doesn't. The people who sit at there computer all day cause there own problems by not getting up out of the chair and going outside or going to the gym. A computer is an in animate object therefor it cannot control the user. Even with a computer you can still interact with family and friends. Most people nowadays use emails to stay in touch. Emailing is now alot faster than regular mail. People also use only chats such as @CAPS1 or windows live. My favorite way to chat with friends and family is via skype. Skype is a video chat service that allows you to talk to anyone in the word at any given time or place. Computers do still allow you to interact with others. A some computer programs allow us do work easier. Programs like rosseta stone help learn languages. Search engines such as google, yahoo, or @CAPS2 helps us to find articles or pictures on certain subjects. They also allows us to find maps and get directions to places. Microsoft word, powerpoint, and excel helps us type up projects, create slide shows, and make spread sheets. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids in my class use these programs almost everyday to help with school and just for fun. Do you think we should use computers? Are they bad for us? Do you think they are benificial? In conclusion computers are very benificial to our everyday life. The allow us access to almost whatever we want to learn. Computers keep us in touch with family and friends in many different ways. I say leave the computers alone they are fine.",9
2158,"Nowadays, every generation is becoming more and more obese. I think that a major contributor to this is computers. When you use the computer a lot, you spend less time enjoying nature, lose exersising time, and isolate yourself from your family and friends. Do you want society to progress like this? While you use the computer, you isolate yourself completely from the outside world. A study from the phycology department of @CAPS1 says that people who are addicted to the internet or other computer games are often estranged from the ones they love. It is a fact that visiting with your family can greatly improve your relationship with them. You @MONTH1 think well, I can talk and visit with my friends virtually, but what about when your family goes out to the movies or your friends are at the park. Do you want to isolate yourself in cyberspace? As almost everybody knows our weight situation. In the @ORGANIZATION1 is rapidly detirorating. Every new generation become fatter and fatter, like a farm of pigs. I think this is because of advances in technology, like computers. Now, on the computer you can play baseball, @CAPS2, tennis lacross, soccer, and any variety of sports. Instead of getting outside and playing. Kids are sustituting play on the computer for actual exersise. Sometimes, a kid's exersises cutshort because of the based computer games running their schedule. The more time spent on a computer, the less time spent exersising, playing sports, or doing other various activities in the real world not the virtual one. Another common problem that most everybody knows about is our failng eco-system. The more time spent on a computer, the less outside enjoying nature. If you have your face studs to the moniter, you won't see all of the endangered species trying to survive and soon youll become different to the world. If we are going to save our world, we must get outside and work a lot the type of work you can do on a computer. I personally spend much more time outside, enjoying nature than my friends with their own computers. If a person can't see the cloud of a mog that hangs over and around cities, than how can they do anything to stop it? Now, I know that people in cities don't have much wildlife to enjoy, but we have not progressed to the where every tree every where a high-rise. Even from big cities like new york, it is only a short drive to nature, a short drive to truly living. Now think back. Do you want to be estranged? Do you want your children to be having heart attack age of ? Do you want to suffer directly from the ecosystem that will no longer  earst? If you do, then you should keep your face on the monitor, but I know that we can change starting with computers.",10
2159,"Dear local Newspaper, the effects that computers have on people are crazy. Everyone around the world uses a computer to find something to research. Some of the websites you can actually talk to your friends! When people found out that you were able to communicate with your frends they talked for hours. The computer can also help you buy things off of the internet. But most of all, the computer has a huge effect on peoples jobs. If you are a real a toy you need to find out information on the house so you will be able to sell it to the customer. Jobs are really important. You need information about things to help you with your job. It can really effect your life if you lose your job by not getting information off the computer. Communicating online is also very helpful. If you get really bored one day you can go online and talk to your friends to see if they want to hang out. I have a connection to when I was in my house on the @DATE1 and I was really bored. So I went online and invited a friend over my house. Weather is another main issue. If you were to get stuck inside your house on a very rainy day and you have nothing to do, you can play games online. When it snows you play outside then come in and get warmed up then go on the computer. I think that on my opinion overall that playing on the computer is really popular for people around the world. Some games you can translate words so you can learn new languages! So even at home on the computer you can get a lot smarter by learning new languages from other people.",8
2160,"Dear readers of the local newspaper, I agree that everyone is using computer nowadays, I think we should do something about it. One reason why I think computers are bad people is because you can't really trust the people in the computer. Another reason is computers are bad for your health, and lastly you don't spend time with your family if you're using the computer too much. First, you can't really trust people in the computer you meet them online and they can lie about everything and you won't even know this is bad if you're only @NUM1 and you're chatting with people you don't know. Yes, you want to make new friends over computer but who can you really trust these days? They can put up fake pictures and you won't want to fall into their trap. Second, I think computer are bad for yor health. They can burn your eyesight and can leave you blind @PERCENT1 of teenagerswho have used the computer for over @NUM2 hours now and need to get glasses because they can't see it. However, you can use the computer for an hour, it'll be fine, but if you use it more than @NUM3 to @NUM4 hours you @MONTH1 need to go to the doctors to check your eyesight. The brightness of the computer can also burn your. Lastly, you don't want the computer to affect you and your lifestyle. These are the three reasons why I think computers are bad for people. You can't trust anyone in the computer, it's bad for your health and thirdly it can affect your life. I hope that with this letter you might do something to help at those in need.",8
2161,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of computers is that they have a positive effect on people. The reasons why computers have a positive effect on people is because people learn new things, they can interact with their family and friends on a computer, and lastly because using moving the mouse on a computer is containing lots of muscles. One reason why computers have positive effects on people is because some people learn new facts everytime they go on the computer. It is very possible to learn new things on a computer everytime you go on a computer because computers contain lots of information. Learning new facts everytime you go on a computer is a good thing people always, say ""you learn something new everyday"". Everytime someone learns something new they are adding more information into their brain. When you add more ideas in your brain the more you know, and the more you know the smarter you are. Those are @CAPS1 reasons and details of why computers have positive effects on people. The second reason why computers have positive effects on people is because people can interact with their family and friends on a computer. Their are video cameras on laptops where you can view your family from out of the state and you can interact with them instead of traveling. When you use a video camera on a laptop you don't have to call. You do not have to go through so much with buying passports to see family and friends that are out of state when you can get in contact with them over a computer. That is another reason why computers have good effects on people. And lastly another reason why computers have good effects on people is because it takes lots of muscles to move the mouse all over the screen. When it contains muscles to do things it is considered exercizing to me because anything that a person does contains muscles. That is a good thing because exercising is good for you. So movements to a computer does contain exersize. That was the last reason of why computers have good effects on people. @CAPS1 position was stated wich was computers do have good effects on people. I also listed @NUM1 reasons why.",9
2162,"Computers are an object that have different opinions from different people. Some people think that @CAPS3 is a perfect use of time to go on the computer all day long, while some parents have time limits for their kids telling them how long they can go on the computer (and the x-box, or play station, @CAPS1, etc.) @CAPS2 that way, they won't have to sit there on a bright, sunny afternoon when they could go for a walk in the park. Companies use computers to make their time more useful to store what people bought, sold, with a click of a mouse and when they would need the information for a refund, click!, and there @CAPS3 pops up. The topic is @CAPS2 debateable that people could protest about @CAPS3. Here are some of the benefits from computers: @CAPS3 can have people save time by ordering online and delivering the item to their house, webcams can let people see others in the convience of their own homes, social networking sites and virtual worlds are another way for people to see each other, and more can be done in less time. Some people think that if you sit on the chair and use the computer all of the time, you might be tired, need a break, or just to go outside to get some fresh air. @CAPS3 can also make people obese and can cause them to die. My opinion is that computers are convient, but they should be used sparingly because they can cause problems in your social life, educational life, etc. I also think that people should use the computer for a purpose, and not spread viruses, worms, trojan horses, or anything like that. Computers have benefits like having time savers on @CAPS3 or can be a defect to your normal life. But, I think that computers are good. This concludes my essay.",8
2163,"Dear Newspaper, I think that people should be able to spend as much time on a computer as they went. While they're on the computer they can tak with friends or do school assinments. People can also learn a lot of important facts as well. Being on the computer can keep kids out of trouble. And the computer can be very helpful to all. In this paragraph I'll tell you how being on the computer can be good for people. One way the computer can help is by printing out an important photo like of a family member or freind. Another way the computer can help is by having younger kids play educational games that help with spelling, math, or reading, A third way the computer can help is by letting us chat with friends that live far far away. Next, I'll tell you about how kids might need the computer for doing class asingments. It can print out an essay at last minutes notice. The computer can send the essay to a teachers email. Or maybe the'll need to quickly type something up for something else. The computer can also allow people to email their lapher! and tell them why they coudn't complete an asignment. Finally, I'll tell you about how the computer can keep kids out of troble and how it helps adults as well. Being on the computer can kids out of bad situations like peer presure, smoking, or doing something bad kids can ba safley at home instead. If kids are always at side playing and running around they could get hurt or break a bone, maybe even hurt someone else, The computer can help out adults as well because people can purchase items that they need. Another it can help is because business owners can check stocks or the. Some can compare the price of different stores. This concludes my letter on how computers can be helpful. Rember the the @LOCATION1 can help a bit. The kids out of trouble. Teach a lot of educational things. And do school assinments.",8
2164,"Evrey year inventors come up with new desings of computers. They always improve and atract customers from @NUM1 years old to a grown adults. Computers can be used for alot of needed things, but after the years people have taken advantage of them. Kids all over spend hours siting on the computer. These computers can be very dangerous to these young kids. Also @CAPS1 people just sit around for hours and dont exercise your body it can become very unhealthy. Also it takes peopel away for the more important things in life. For my first reason, I am stateing that it is very dangours for kids to have a opening to evreything there is in the world. Kids are talking to strangers whitch can result to a bad ending. There are so many syber avenders that just wait for a young kid to come around and talk to them. They end up coming them to do things that they shouldn't be doing. There have been so many crimes that have to do with kids and the internet. Kids spend way to much time on the open internet. Kids and adults spend hours on computers. Its ussaly for pointless things. They sit there when they could be outside excirsising or go to a gym. They could be doing somthing as thats good. For their health. Many kids and adults have been oveweight due to the lack of exercis. One of the main reasons why is because of them siting around on a computer for so many hours doing nothing. They get so focused on what they are doing on the computer they never have time to get up and exercis their bodys. My last reason that I think computers have been taken advantage of is because it takes time away for more imporant things. It takes away from things like Family, Friends, @CAPS2 work, and alot more. @CAPS1 people spend all this time on computers they will grow apart from family and friends. Also kids will not have time to do homwork and their grades will drop. Geting into colledges to start a life is way more important then doing pointless activities on the computer. Now you know all my reasons why I think computers have been taken advantage of adults and kids are taken away from the more important things in life. Also for kids very dangourus. Lastley people are beoming overweight due to spending time on computers. Thats why I think computers have been taken advantage",9

2166,"Dear @CAPS1, I know computers might seem helpful but in the hands of a teen, preteen or child they are not in thoose hands children become mindless zombies. They stay away from family don't sleep and you never know what there doing. First off, even though we have all this technology minors abuse @CAPS4. They could do realy nastey things ok. You never know, for all they know they probably talking to some @NUM1 year old pervert! Would you know?

(note never let cildren got'n @LOCATION1 they will be abducted) @CAPS3 reason is children become adicted to the computer they will never come to you. Listen I know a friend the only comes outside once a year because he stays at home playing a computer game! He was @CAPS2 adicted hand to tie him up to go outside @CAPS4 was truly awful how pale and barely he was I puked. @CAPS2 at least try grounding them from @CAPS4 or locking them away from @CAPS4. My third final reason is kids will just truly get hooked and will fall school. They will just cease living normaly they some how feed of of technology. @CAPS4's really glue some never let this happen everthis is your last warning. @CAPS2 nows the time to act don't let this happen curb your children now unless you wait a future of nothingness. Its time to act unless you wanting have your child get taken into that anarchy!",8
2167,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I firmly support advances in technology. I feel that computers have placed a positive effect on us. Imagine a mother sitting at home chatting with distant friends. Suddenly, her daily calendar pops up, reminding her to go to the gym for one hour today. If she didn't have this gentle reminder, she would probably forget to get her daily excersize in printout directions to the gym would be helpful as well how could she get this done? With a click of a button, thanks to technology. New @CAPS1 @CAPS2 magazine states that @PERCENT2 of people living in @LOCATION2 own a computer! communication devices such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS5, and @CAPS8 @CAPS9 class finders have been key tools to today's socialization.

Bringing old friends together through this tool can change your life in so many ways! Maybe you'll find a close friend, or possibly a spouse you would've never even considered @CAPS6 websites like @ORGANIZATION2 and @LOCATION1 have created marraiges that improved individuals lives @PERCENT1. Computers move like lightning! You can go from writing a report on the roman @CAPS7 t the history of @LOCATION3 almost instantaneously!

2168,"Dear lacal newspaper, I wrote this letter to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I think it gives people the ability to talk to their family and friends from far away places. They get a chance to meet new people and hae fun with it. One reason is because you night have your family far away from you and you never get a chance to see them; so your best choice is the computer. I know that some people are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and not enjoying nature. But just think about it some people just like to be in the house and just have time for themselves @CAPS1 reason is because it helps your kids learn more about life and nature, it also helps them learn about faraway places, places they have never sint in life. Enjoying nature can be dangerous. more than @PERCENT1 of the people in this world get hurt exploring new things and places. You can't force somebody to leave the computer benine. If thats what they like being in their house and not trying new things well its up to them it's their life not yours. The third reasone is because there are social skills, leassons and activities kids can try out on a computer. Things they can't do in the real world. Adults have a chance to find friends from their high school years in facebook and get a chane to talk about how are they doing in life today. Remember that you @MONTH1 be concerned about the people spending more time in the computer but some bad things @MONTH1 be good things and good things @MONTH1 come out to be bad things.",8
2169,"Dear @CAPS1 I think computers do keep people from going outside and exercising. People have to much fun playing online, checking their email and listening to music on the web. When they should be out side having fun. Parents should spend time keeping their child outside they can sign them up to a sport, take them to the beach or to the park. As long as their child is not on the computer. Parents im sure you you want you children healthy so get them out side to exercise. Also keep your kid @CAPS2 if they are bored you can buy them a toy to play with outside, keeping them away from the computer. You can also take them on a bike or camping. Computers should not be used all the time. So remember you can sign yor kid up on a sport, take them biking, go to the beach, buy them an outside toy or take them to the park. ",6

About @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 uses computers a day to do what they need to get done. What my point is that the people of @LOCATION1 can't live without computers. Major boltom as well agree with me. He even said,""that hewould be lost without his computer."" Computers just making things easier to do know a days. Today computers are used to do your homework online, buy things without leave your house, and help map quest places you want to go. In fact, studys show that @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 says that computers make work a whole faster to do.

Many kids that are young know more about computers then their parents. This is a positive thing because kids can use the computer for homework help.

There are more important things that you have to do other than and paly computer .

Computers can help alot expecialy with homework @PERCENT1 of teens use the interact whether its for research or homework for science computers have been helping the world for years and many to come. If you didn't know teachers assign online home work instead of handing out thoustands of papers and if you dont have a computer it sucks to be you. Thats why computer have a positive effect.

2173,"Dear editor, I agree with your position about computers being used to much that people dono't wan't to get a chance to go outside. Here are @NUM1 reasons why I agree. The @CAPS1 reason why I agree with this position is not interacting with family and friends I say this because, some of the people that use the computer get more adicted everyday they wont talk with people. Another issue is that the computers can get more enjoyable for the user's. For example, new games, web sites and even job applications. As you can see these sorts of things get very addicting to kids to adults. The second reason why I agreed to this position is exercising I think this because in ways the human body needs an amount of exercising each and everyday. In other words if a user sits on a chair all day and he or she always getsclose to the computers screen that can hurt your body without you even noticing. Another way use'rs should exercise is to motivates them selves to have some strenghth in their life. For example - if user's dond't get much exercise it can cause problems to their body like asthma, dihabites, or cancer and there are more. The third reason why I agree to this position is eating because user's get to concentrated on the computer they sametimes dono't get to eat as offen as they did before.",7
2174,"Dear newspaper, I believe that people spend too much time on the computer. Most people nowadays ""talk"" through e-mail, but instead, they should be face-to-face talking with each other. Also, being outside is much better for you, because your body needs things like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 from the sun. Lastly, there could be bad things on the @CAPS3, like websites that could send viruses to your computer. As you can see, these are all the reasons why I believe that the computer can be dangerous. ""@CAPS4"" with people through the @CAPS3 is not healthy. First of all, it decreases people's ability to make conversations. Statistics clearly show that about @PERCENT1 of people who talk with other people over e-mail have trouble talking and making good conversations with other people in the real world. Second of all, when people talk through e-mail, they're basically having a conversation with their computer rather than with an actual person, and this is not healthy. Lastly, talking with people over email can be addictive, and you might lose track of time and end up staying on the computer for hours. During this time, you should be outside getting fresh air or running around! Being outside is very important. The sun gives your body @CAPS1 @CAPS2, which is a @CAPS1 needed in the process of digesting proteins. Also, being outside gives you fresh air. This is essential because your body needs natural, fresh air to stay healthy. Staying inside all day isn't good for you, because then you're just breathing in stuffy air. Finally, being outside gives you exercise. I know whenever I go out for a run, I feel great because getting vitamins, fresh air, and fantastic exercise. Lastly, people shouldn't go on the computer as much because there could be bad things on the @CAPS3. For example, in certain websites, there could be viruses that the website sends to your computer. I remember one time, our computer was completely locked up, so we couldn't go to the @CAPS3 or @ORGANIZATION1 word or any of our icons, so we had to get a professional to come to our house and fix our computer for us. Also, there could be inappropriate things on the @CAPS3 that young children shouldn't see. Lastly, there could be some websites that cause your computer to respond very slowly or freeze. This is why people shouldn't waste all their time on the computer! So I believe that people should go on the computer less frequently because ""@CAPS4"" with people through e-mail is not the healthy, being outside is much better for you, and the computer could have bad things.

2175,"Dear local Newspaper, Computers are becoming a problem with kids these days and how they are constantly on them kids abuse their privelouses of using their computers. They also usually have too much freedom with their computers using it whenever they want. Seven out of ten kids between the ages ten through sixteen spend at @TIME1 day on their computer. This is a problem that needs to stop so kids can exercise more and be active. sometimes the reason kids are on the computer so much is their parents don't care how long their kids are using electronics instead of getting freshair and enjoying the outdoors. One of my friends is on the computer as soon as he gets off the buss so he can look at things he wants to buy. These kids need to start being outside more. Kids are constantly abusing their privelauges on their computers. An example of this all too common problems when the childs @CAPS1 is at work they go on the computer when they are suppose to be doing something like homework orchores. The kids in this time are too attached to their electronics and the ""can't"" live without them. Most adults let their children use their computer or the family computer whenever they want to without being supervised. now I'm not saying that the child is going to be irresponsible with their freedom but don't you think that that is way too much freedom? with all the time the kids aren't doing homework or something that actually needed to be done on the computer the kids could be spending time with friends, playing sports, or some other fun outdoor activity. As you can see, kids in this day and age abuse their technology way too much. Whether it's how much time they spend on the computer, their privelauges on the computer, or even the freedom the kids have on the computer. The kids need to learn to be more active and healthy, this is why I am against the time kids are using their technology for leisure instead of something they need.",8
2176,"Dear Newspaper, Computers don't hurt people, they help them. They have many benefits. People don't even spend all day on the computer, they help us learn new things, and they help doctors and scientists cure diseases. As you can see computers help the world.

Whenever I go to the beach, it's always packed! However, some people do spend all day on the computer but thats a small part of the population. Computers do benefit the world! If we didn't have computers, now would we talk with family members who live far away? Some people have family and friends who live in different places then they do. They use computers to talk with them. For example, my family and I would not be able to see my @CAPS1 as often as we would like to if we couldn't talk with her on the computer. In other words, I wouldn't be able to see my @CAPS1 if computers wern't around. Another reason computers benefit society is it teaches you things that you otherwise woudn't know! Have you ever heard someone say ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 it""? If we didn't have computers we woudn't be able to look up things or do projects at home. Computers have made people smarter!

If scientists didn't have computers they might not be able to cure some diseases.

Just think about it; without computers, where would we be today? If you have friends or family far away, you probably know what a hassle it is to house phone cards in order to talk to them. They cost money and you have to enter lots of different numbers. With computers, you can talk to them free, online, and you @CAPS2't even have to call them. If something happens to a family member of yours, the fastest way for everyone to find out is to just send an e-mail to them and you @CAPS2't have to each person seporatly.

Grown people have depended on there computer to find everything and the websites have come to there attention so they get attached to the computers. As for students, they also get attached to these websites such as myspace, youtube, facebook, etc. i think its good to use your computer once in a while instead of all the time. Some students end up getting jumped over online talking. Some grown ups just sit around all day interacting with people on the computer and don't interact with there kids. In my opinion, people should go outside more and hang out or go out with there kids. Why sit around all day on the computer and have online coversations with ramdom people when you can go outside and hang out with your friends. it has came to my attention that some paretnts avoid these kids and don't want to listen to what they have to say because there so into the computer. Children also like to start trounble with people online and then kids get hurt over something that was said. I would .like to see more people going out then staying home on a computer.

My first reason is that when your on the computer, it's taking away time to spend with your friends or your family. When your on the computer and your so sucked in your not spending enough time with your friends or family. Instead of comming home from school and going onto the computer, make plans with your friends and go do something. Instead of going on the computer, make plans to do something with your family, like go out for ice-cream or something. Just don't go on the computer. You do nothing when your on the computer, which @MONTH1 have a result of falling asleep or getting yelled at to get off. Another reason I have is that when your on the computer, time flys by so fast, you don't even realize it. Then, you loose track of time. Sometimes, people get so sucked in, that they forget that they have homework or need to study for a test. It @MONTH1 be important to do your homework before you get sucked in, then you want have to about doing it after you loose track of time. Some parents @MONTH1 even get sucked info, and that might be bad to because who's going to make you dinner? My last and final reason is that you need to get out! If you sit, in a chair, in a stuffy room, stairing at a screen, that's just not good. Just picture it, it dosn't look very good. Getting out is a really good thing to do in your life. It's a big part of it. It's one thing that keeps you nice and healthy. When you get out you are doing things that make you happy. Like, hanging out with friends or doing fun things with your family. Sitting inside on a beautiful day, dosn't that make you sad? Wouldn't you want to go outside instead of sitting and playing around on the computer? These were some of the reason why I think that people are spending to much time on the computer. Doing this can cause some seriuos problems like not spending time with family and friends, forgetting about major things, and not getting out enough. These are major issues. I definately think that people are spending way to much time on the computer. Thanks for listening.",10
2181,"Dont you think computers are not a waste of time? Well I mean if you think about it, computers have a very large effect on people. For example, kids and teenagers spend more time on the @CAPS1 thatn doing their homework. Also teens stay uplate at night and chat with their friends or people don't even know! Lasly, computers are not healthy because teens would rather sit in front of a computer than exercising. Well, as we all and most on their thime on the @CAPS1 doing their. For example, kids would go on the computer and tell there parents they don't, do. and kids also on the @CAPS1 watching think what could be spending more time doing their homework. Lastly, most teens and big test that they need to study for. But, what they would rather do is on the @CAPS1. Teenagers just love to their don't on school days we all know teenagers and watch televison and the. If you think about it, late wake up and early the next day. Also, most teens chat with thier friends online. For example, because planty not tot the where their time. Lastly, I must that computers are for teens at all! Many should agree! This is because teenagers used to sit in front of a computer. Rather than ! We also know that a lot of teens @CAPS2. You @CAPS2 sports you hsould spend times on the computer and practice on getting ! Computers are their taking time out from the fresh air and being with your friends at the or even time mall! Yup ! S you I think all agrees. Next computers in a have on teens and. Thier are many ",8
2182,"Dear @CAPS1, I agree that spend more time on a computer than work outor do other things like cleaning his/her home or room. Anther reson is if you are on a computer talk to someone you mite not know who they are or how old they mite be be. @CAPS2 last reson why is more people needs to excercis then its on a computer all day @CAPS2 first reson was he or she how to clean there room or house because if you stay on a computer you will never time to clean you meat someone online and if they come over they mite not want to stay with you because your to clean and @CAPS2 last reson is if you dont have a clean house you can find games or for the computer. @CAPS2 reson was you mite know what are they are who they are because if you ask these because you are talking to online to come over they mite be a killer or a rapist. Plus if you talk to that person everyday you or they mite be come with each other. If you mite be driven crazy for that person and crazy stuff. @CAPS2 last reson for this message is to excercis because if you are on a computer all day you will never have to exercis. Or if you yoo can't be active like playing baseball. So when you do get off ther computer and go play baseball you will be slow or not even want to play at all. Iam in conclusion computers are good to have but not the last thing to do all day because you will not be able to clean your house, you mite talk to all killer or not be to work out and be fit @CAPS3 you for reading.",8
2183,"Dear newspaper, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. They have a positive effect on people because @CAPS1 gives them important information. Also that they can talk to family members or friends. Another thing is that @CAPS1 is really fun and @CAPS1 is a good exercise for their fingers. First of all, the computer gives them important information, @CAPS1 helps them learn about the history of different places that they didn't know about. Also that if kids needed help on their homework they could use the computer to help them. Another thing is that @CAPS1 help people learn about the news and what is happining. Second of all, the computer allows them to talk to family members and friends. They could send pictures to there friends or family members. Another thing that they can do is see each other online. Also @CAPS1 is good way to keep in touch with there family members. Last but not least, the computer is really fun and at the same time a helpful exercise. They could play lots of games such as racing, baseball and many others online. Also that they could put there pictures online. @CAPS1 is also a good exercise because when they type they use the fingers which is a good exercise. In conclusion, computers are a positive effect on people because @CAPS1 gives them important information, they can talk to family members and friends, and its fun and great exercise at the same time.

2184,"Dear @CAPS1 - @CAPS2, @CAPS3 you think the internet is useful and beneficial to the community? Recently, it has been brought to my attention that @LOCATION1 civilians disagree. Without a doubt, I firmly believe that their thoughts are ludacris. The internet allows people to interact with distant friends and family members. The world wide web also helps people relax and is convenient. First of all, the internet allows people to interact with distant friends and family members. Not to long ago, my mother and i joined www.@CAPS4.com. Since our friends and family never pick up the phone, we thought chatting on the internet might be a good idea. When we both signed up, we found out that our entire family is on @CAPS4 and they are glued to it almost all day! Now, instead of having voicemail messages and not talking, we can talk to (or type to) them anytime & place! Secondly, the internet helps people relax. You could hop on the computer and play a game that pulls you into another demension and forget about the stress you endured that day. In recent studies, @PERCENT1 of participants agreed that their body and mind felt renewed and replenished. My mother and father even agree! Combined, my parents work almost twenty hours a day and the computer helps them their troubles. Thirdly, the computer is very convenient. Before people by stop and shop was invented, my family would hate shopping. Now, supermarkets are taking this idea and its become enjoyable to shop. Also, some older folk and handicapped people @MONTH1 not be able to go shopping or out at all. Thanks to the internet and their amazing ideas, life is much easier for them! Computers and the internet are two fabulous inventions. They make it easier to communicate with friends and family, relax, and make things more convenient. If not for the internet, life would be rough harder than it is. Please take my opinion seriously and agree with portion of the population that is for computer usage!",8
2185,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, I think that computers are a waste because nobody likes to go out & exercise anymore for example instead of going outside & playing baseball they stay inside, turn on the computer & play baseball on the internet instead of going out & getting some fresh air. Another example why computers are bad is when you chat online you sometimes dont know who you are talking too. That is how people are getting kidnapped now because they're trusting these online. When people their pictures online they dont know who is looking at them. The internet is a great thing but everything good always comes to a end. The internet is a part of our society but every now & then we have to cut it off cause one know People today think that computers are ways to meet new people & learn new things so dont you read a book or go outside & explore but that is just my opinion I hope you agree to.",6
2186,"Dear @CAPS1 Time I strongly beleave that computers can only help us and can do no wrong. As we all know by now the world around us is changing and changing for the better I think computer are basically the key to the online world with it anything can be done. The computer can help you comunicate with family and freinds from all over the world, it is a faster and easier way to learn and it computers are helping business get to consumers. Family is one of the most important thing to me and I think it is for most people to. Families offen dont live in the same town state or even country as each other. For example my family is from @LOCATION3 and @CAPS2 to @LOCATION1 but one of my uncles live in @LOCATION2 a @NUM1 hour drive from were I live. So as yo can imagine we dont see each other often @MONTH1 be twice a year. So for siblings who have grown of with each other that is no ebough so many of my uncles communicat through @CAPS3. Computers are also a key to education, so why not unlock the door. When soemone has acsese to computers at tjeir home it is live a cortable library. Also it makes things much easiers to do such as going to dictionary, con instead of looking up a word. Their will also be a end to that question I didind understand the homework the internet can provide you with the answers you need. Consider computers and education a advancement in our system of learning. Computers also help buisnesses. Buissnesses have always been triang to get to his consumer. Throug comercials, sighns even walking up to your door and telling you what to buy now computers have a new world of consumers. What well known buisness do you know of that dont have there own website @CAPS1 publick schools even have thers own site, so everyone is steping up. So in conclusion you see that compers are a key to the world after reading this I hope you share my point of view. Computers are help learn communicate and share your ideas.",8

This is why I would like to talk about weather or not computers have a positive effect on @CAPS8. In @CAPS6 opinion I @CAPS7 Computers have a negative effect. On @CAPS8. In @DATE2 The average @CAPS10 was not @CAPS9. But today however More than @PERCENT3 of @CAPS10 are overweight or @CAPS9, @CAPS11 no, schools do not have a positive effect on @CAPS8 because they cause a @CAPS15 of exercise less time enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. The average @CAPS10 between the ages of @NUM1 get less than @CAPS12 hour of exersise a day. I myself usally fal under That statistic myself. on average a spend about @NUM2 hours each day on a computer. @CAPS30 this @CAPS13 is why many experts are blaming computers @CAPS30 The @CAPS14 in obeseity and @CAPS15 of exersise. @CAPS11 twenty years from now what will happen to @CAPS16 @CAPS17 if we don't act now. Next is that computers cause people to spend less time enjoying nature. According to A @CAPS18 statistic The average visit to a national park has droped by @PERCENT4, and the average vist to local park's has droped by @PERCENT5. Me myself is part of that statistic aswell. When @CAPS6 boyScout troop goes on a campout I find myself more to stay home rather then venture out into the woods with @CAPS6 friends. Lastly computers cause people to spend less time with @ORGANIZATION1. A personal @CAPS19 is @CAPS6 cousin @PERSON1. In @CAPS6 opinion he isn't the smartest person @CAPS20 but he's ok.

2188,"Dear Newspaper, I belive that computers have a positive, effect on people. The are a great way to save time as technology continues advancing. Also, they make people happier. they can even help you to expand your knowledge on any given subject. Clearly, computers have a positive effect on people, and help people every day. The first reason why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people is because using them is a great way to save time. Paying taxes used to be a very time consuming thing that people have to do every year. But, now that computers exist to help people pay taxes easily, it takes a lot less time to do so. In fact, it has been proven that people, who use computers to pay their taxes spend only @PERCENT1 of the time that people who don't have computers spend on doing their taxes. Also, computers can help you save time when you type. Whenover you write a document for school or for a job, typing is a much. It has been proven that people who type their papers instend of than finish must. As you effect on people computers have positive effect on people use them make people happier. Computers are very advanced technology and include fun games to play and endless amounts of websites. With computers, you have to many opportunities. You can create your own website by just the click of a button or became an alien in space in your favorite online game. You can even catch up on a television show you might have missed the night before and watch it with no commercials. It is also a know fact that @PERCENT2 of people who own computers are generally more happy than people who do not own computers. Therefore, computers have a positive, effect on people is because they can help you to expand your knowledge. Any fact that you @MONTH1 want to know about anything from ancient @CAPS1 to which athletes are cometing in the next @DATE1 olympics can be found on computer. If you wanted to, you could learn an entire language just from your computer. In fact, @PERSON1, the owner of a very popular computer campany called @ORGANIZATION1 once said:""Computers are a gatewawy to knowledge."" I believe that this statement is true. Also studies show that @PERCENT3 of the average person's knowledge comes from things they learned from a computer. So, computers have a positive effect on people. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on people because they are a great way to save time, they make people happier, and they can help to expand your knowledge on any given subject. Clearly, computers are a huge advantage in life and would be hard to live without. I hope that the editor of your newspaper appriciates my ideas and hopefully agrees with them as well. Thank You!",10
2189,"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on people. They have a lot of information give @CAPS2 quicker and increase peoples social ability. Although most people I know are always on the computer I do not believe it's a waste of time. Having a computer is good when you need to do research or write a paper because it allows you to type your ideas if you have messy handwriting. It also provides a lot of information that's right at home instead of having to go to the library and check out multiple books. computers are a good information sources that help you learn about all different kinds of topics. Computers can do all sorts of things like telling you about up-coming events and the latest @CAPS2. At home I know I can never find the right @CAPS2 channel so i just look it yp on the internet. Its also really easy, you just type in what you want to look for in a search engine like @CAPS1 and it will bring you to a group of websites on your topic. Computers quickly change the information as soon as it comes out, making t fresh @CAPS2. I also think that computers benefit the younger age because it allows them to meet new people and stay in touch with family and friends. Websites like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5 are good I think in moderation. The internet can be a very dangerous place but can also allow silent communication between friends. All my friends are on @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 all the time we can talk to each other all at once, while sharing pictures and videos. It really keeps us occupied and allows us to spend time with people even if they're not really there. In conclusion, I think the computer is a great benefit to everyone by giving us information quick @CAPS2, and by allowing us to stay in touch with friends and family. The computer has modernized so much and will continue to help people out. even if that means spending some time inside or even an hour or so. Over all I think computers are great to have.",9
2190,"Dear local Newspaper, The other day I was reading one of your newspaper and I saw the area were you wrote about people not like to use the computer. Well I agree a little because people have to learn how to tip like me I use the computer and I tip really fast, my mom, dad and two brothers use the computer as well. People use the computer for a lot of things like doing homework or playing game or if they have free time just to look up stuff to learn about. Most people use it to make a liveing. They use it to make there on bissness at home. An yes I agree about what people think about computers like its not a bad thing if you dont like computers, I think its a good ideas for people not to use computers cause it can save a lot of money you can have over @NUM1 by not using computers. People get off your computer go out side play soccer, football do somthing. An dont just stay on the computer if your @NUM2 get a job make money. Hang out withe friends some of you are computer geeks and play some dragon games when you can be out side find new friends, you should only have @NUM3 hours to play on the computer like really do somthing with your life.

2191,"Dear Local newspaper, I think that the computers are bad. @CAPS8 one reason you get not a lot of exersise, two now they have vurtal planting of flowers and other plantes and tree's when you should be planting a real garden. My thrid a final idea is when you are online you are being lazy. Not a lot of exersise because you can play solitar on the computer when it is so you can go swimming or ride a bike or even go play tag with your friends and or your family. @CAPS8 example lets say you have the choice of a new computer and use it @CAPS8 the day or go to the park and run. chase your little brother or sister and or your cusions even, wich one would you chose? @CAPS1 is this virtual planting? I was talking to my aunt and she was watching this five year old and she asked ""@CAPS1 are you doing?"" The five year old was on @CAPS2 on @CAPS3 on her mothers accont. Now when I heard that I said to myself ""This new technology is taking everything to virutral."" I think that if you want to go plant virtural flowers you should go outside and plant some roses, or even a apple tree. When I look outside I do not see as much flowers as when I was younger. Now are you going to plant virtural flowers or reel flowers? When you are online and looking to see @CAPS1 @CAPS5 has, you are bring a lazy person. You want get us take your family or even your friends and say ""@CAPS4 do you want to go to @CAPS5 with me?"" @CAPS6 @CAPS1 you do is sit on your butox and go online. To tell you the truth I do it but when I am done I go to the store to see the clothes and to try them on.I hate it when people say ""@CAPS7 I cant I am online shopping."" @CAPS8 one you are taking someones job away by the virtual register that could be someone lossing their job. In this ecomincy that could be very hard on a person @CAPS6 job @CAPS6 money if they own a house they have to pay the bills and morage so if they do not have the money they just lost these house. Just because you want to go online shopping maybe because it is easier, but still think next time @CAPS1 if you were that person? How would you feel? So now you know my side of this story. @CAPS1 is your side the lazy, virtural planting and online person or the one who will get up and go outside and just go do it?",9
2192,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers help people in many ways such as: helping scientist to gain information that will help mankind live a long life by finding cures for illnesses, allowing people to interact with other people all around the world and help ordinary people like you and I learn new things everyday. Do computers have a positive effect on people? I think they do because they help ordinary everyday people like you and I learn new things every day. If we didn't have computers getting information to every one across the world take a long time, if you mailed it it would take about one to two days if they are in the same country as you, and there is no possible way you could call everyone in the world to tell them you be on the phone for weeks maybe months at a time. Further more computers help scientists find cures and other ways to help mankind live long and prosper. If scientists didn't have computers people would be dying left and right because they didn't have the proper medication or medical attention, we wouldn't have half things we have @DATE1 if we didn't have computers. In conclusion computers make life much easier and getting information people around the the world quicker and more efficient.

2193,"Dear local newspaper, I understand that there is an important debate between the people who support computers and people who believe that too much time is being spent on the internet. I can insure you that the internet is affecting peoples physical health, distracting students from their schoolwork, and causing less time to be spent with family and friends. People are spending too much time on computers and it is affecting their physical health. Studies have shown that the average child spends three to four hours on the computer. This is causing people to lack exercise. For example, my friend @PERSON1 is always on @CAPS1 and playing his computer games. He started this trend last year. Since then, he has gained fourty pounds. He now weights @NUM1 lbs and is @NUM2 lbs overweight. It doesn't surprise me because a recent has shown that the leading cause of childhood obesity is children spending too much time on the computer. Do you want america to stay obeise? Computers are distracting students from completing their schoolwork. My friend @PERSON2, a freshman at @ORGANIZATION1, is a victim of distraction by computer. He enjoys @CAPS1 very much, but is on it all the time. This has distracted him from completing and turning in his science homework. Soon, his @NUM3 or @CAPS3+ average dropped drastically to a @NUM4 or @CAPS4-. Soon after, he decided he'@CAPS6 rather go on @CAPS1 then study for tests and quizes. His final grade for the trimester was soon a @NUM5 or a @CAPS6. Do you want to end up like @PERSON2 and receive a horifically low grade in a class that you are very capable of passing? Well studies has became more technologically advanced, our students average grades have been slowly decreasing. Unless we want this trend to continue, we must limit the time our students spend on the computer. Computers are causing children to lose quality time to spend with family and friends. Children need to spend time with their families. They are the people who support children through hard times and comfort them when they are sad. I have a very close relationship with my parents. They are always there for me whenever I reed them. This allows me to maintain my mental health. For example, when I was six, there was a child named @PERSON3 who would always bully me. Whenever I took mental abuse from him, my parents were always there to comfort me. What I am getting at is that children need a healthy relationship with their parents to maintain peace of mind. Although, if children are always on computers, they are not able to build a healthy relationship with their family. The same goes for friends. They are people you can always talk to, but if you are always on the computing then they cannot be there for you. If children do not stop using computers so frequently they will be risking there mental health. Do you want america to remain the most obeise country in the world? Do you want our children's academic performance to plumet? Do you want students to miss out on quality time with their friends and family? Then we must limit the amount of time people spend on computers before its effects on america are too drastic.",10
2194,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 have been many discussions floating around about the new technology of out society. Most of them, about computors. Some people say it is making our society more connected. Sure, I agree with that statement, but @CAPS1 are serious negative effects on; humanbeings with these computrrs. Addiction is found to be rising everywhere, along with danger with the internet brings. Many people have even lost their health to it! The list goes on and on. So do you think computors are really worth it? First of all, youth andeven adults become addicted to it. The new things such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3 twitter. Once people start up with these things, they can'r stop! Imagine; your mom finally let's you get a @CAPS2. You're so excited, you stated let's say @NUM1.m. you're so into it you ook up at the clock and it says one o'clock in the morning! You've been on for six hours! How did the time fly? Your getting addicted. You realize you're starting to do that every day. Your grades are failing, you haven't done any homework for the past month, and flunked all your tests. You see what computors can do to people? Time to dig a little bit deeper. Then, more trouble comes. Many teens and even some adults have died because of their computor! They go on to a communication website and meet unknown people. They can lie about their age, life and everything. sooner or later they willingly give their mystery person their name and address. Not a terrific idea. Before they know it, a killer could be knocking at their door. I would say @PERCENT1 of people who give strangers their address get into alot of deep trouble. People have died, been assaulted or have been mentally injured. It's not fun being cornered like that. Too many people have gone through this. No more pain should go around. Last but not least, people suffer from loss of health because of it. People never get to go outside or exsersize. All they do is sit infront of their computors and play games and send emails. People can also suffer from obecety. They never do anything but eat and play with their computor. Is that really a life to live? Doing nothing your whole life? Maybe losing all you energy over time, so all you can do is sleep? You could probably die young because of that. Get active and get exersize. I'm no saying ""@CAPS5 ever get on your computor again!"" I'm saying, don't sit like a cuch potatoe! Do you see all the problems computors can cause people to have? They're terrible! loss of health, addiction and even pain and death. Get people to stop spending time on their computor so much. Even just writing about it in the paper can really encourage people! Help stop the addiction; stop the pain!",10
2195,"@CAPS2 I think of a computer I think of a piece of high tech technology with trillions of websites on every subject. But, just because these are made for a good reason doesn't mean the effort they have on people is go. Most people who have computers are helpful"" and @CAPS1 example of ""@NUM1"" century technology"" but are they right? My main question here is are them computer and are these computers for good as the look? Being a teenager I know and a computers can do chatting online, listening to music, watching t.v. shows are all great examples of what sucks you into the internet universe. I spoke to local citizen @PERSON1, @NUM2, and asked her point of view on computers. She says,""@CAPS2 I was a child we never had any technology just sticks and stone. We never had to worry about not getting enough exercise because all we would do is pay outside,""kids today just sit in front of the computer, staring into a screen and moving mouse. That is not my idea of exercise. With computers comes higher obsesity rates. Getting off the computer and playing outside for just @CAPS1 house a day will change your life. Picture this a nice hot @DATE1 day you look outside and see the sun is shining in the sky and theres not a cloud in sight. The sound of birds chirping and bers roaming through your head. And what are you doing? Instead of being out these and enjoying your loosing up pictures of it. Why would you watch a frozen picture @CAPS2 you could watch mother nature in action right before you eyes? Instead of looking at pictures people why dont you take you take some yourself? It's beautiful out there so why don't you experience ot for youself and not have someone else do it for you. Being with my family and friends the most important thing in my life. Some @MONTH1 argue and you can talk to your friend and family on the computer you. Isn't the computer depriving you of something though? For example if a family member is sick with cancer wouldn't you rather be with them every moment you can instead of spending sometime instant messaging them on the computer. Theres one thing the computer can't let you do and thats how much you core someone. As you can see computer hour the pro's and there con's but initially I think the con's win. There so much a computer can do but one thing it cant do is make your desicions. So, are computers as good as they look? that is for you to decide. """,9

And in past years I, myself have bought food from stop and shop online it's quite and efective. All from the comfort of your home.

2197,"Dear reader, @CAPS1 you know that the obesity rate in the @LOCATION1 has grown @PERCENT1 since technology became more advanced? Some say that computers are harmless and have a positive effect on people, where as others say that they have a negative effect on us I for one believe that computers do not benefit anyone. They prevent family time, distract people from other activities, and cause people to get less exercise. To begin, with computers around, families just don't have the same connection they used to. Computers have a large role in most peoples lives, and if there are people in your way of one, such as family members, then a fight breaks out, useally between sbilings. Computers always leave marks on families because not only do they cause fights, but they are unreliable. Information and important papers can get lost easily on a computer and cause you to miss out on the fun things trying to find it. One time I typed an essay on my computer, I saved it, I closed it, and went on my day. The next day I go to print it not its gone I had to type the whole thing again! As you can tell, computers just cause problems and prevent families from having fun. In addition, a computer just prevents people from doing other activities. I have been on the computer inumerable times. When I was supposed to be feeding the animals, cleaning my room paracticing my flute, and each time I end up regreting it. Also, I know many kids that would rather play on the computer thatn go outside and play be cause it is ""too hot"". If kids find any little flow, they will make it an excuse to just play on the computer. Computers are just preventing people from enjoying other activities. To conclude my reasons, computers are just plain unhealthy. If you think about it, computers are like cigarettes, unhealthy and addicting. The prevent people from exercising and staying healthy. @CAPS1 you know that almost @PERCENT2 of the growing obesity in @LOCATION2 is due to playing on the computer? Most people sit home all day, on their computers, only lifting a finger to type or click the mouse. This can be dangerous to people it can cause blood dots and heart attacks. @PERCENT3 of deaths per day are due to obesity. If you can't tell, computers can be hazerdous to people's health. To sum things up, computers are no good to the human race. The cause fights within families, less participation in activities, and contribut to the most dangerous thing, obesity. Computers just make life worse for you and me in the long run. Think, would you rather become overweight and play on the computer liek the people who think it is good for you, or would you rather join me and the others who are healthy?",10
2198,"Dear Newspaper, I think computers have a positive effect on people. I say this because I play on computers all day. One reason is because i now have awesome hand-eye cordination. For example on my computer if im about to die in a game, I just grab the keyboard and dont look. If that that doesnt make sense than me and my friends playgames with food where you put a cheese - it on the table and whoever grabs it. And i always get it. Another reason is that I can talk to my frinds online. This is good because then i don't have to make the phone bill more expensive. Also, I can help them with their homework online without having to be next to them. And the last reason I have to share is you can get maps online so you know how to get to places you dont know. That can help everyone because its a lot easier to get a map with directions then trying to decode an atlas or a map of the state. I know that you can also get pictures of school projects too. That is helpful because it will help you grade go up. These are the reasons that I think you should consider looking at before you say that computers are a waste of time and people spend too much time on them.",7
2199,"Dear Newspaper, Computers are in many ways a positive affect on people. They help people stay connected with friends and family, they allow people to see the news and weather at any point of the day, and they give people easy access to information need to be reasearched. This is why I think computers are positive. Phones help people stay connected through voice, but computers help people actually see and hear each other. @PERCENT1 of people use a progarm called skype which allows them to video chat with friends and family. Sometimes familys don'@CAPS1 own a webcam so instead the can use email to stay connected. You can send pictures through email and chat or just send someone a message to tell them your doing fine and ask how they are doing. Seven out of ten homes have parents leaving earlier than @NUM1. This means that they either dont have enough time to watch the news and weather or they dont want to disturb the other sleeping family members with the @CAPS1.V on. So instead of watching the @ORGANIZATION1 they can go on the computer and see the weather forecast and news. They can also see if there were any car crashes or other problems on the route they would take to work. This also helps when familys are going on trips. They can look at the weather forecast and decide what they need to bring with them. Almost @PERCENT2 of students use the @CAPS2 to do reasearch. They find information needed to do homework and projects. Most of the time school books do not have enough of the information. Needed to do assignments. Therefore, the computer is an excellent source to get more. Also, using @CAPS2 information helps kids be creative using different information than a text book offers also shows diversity in assignments. When students have different information not only does that one student learn but if they present it to the class the whole class learns something new. That is why I think computers are positively effective. They help familys and friends stay connected, they show people news and weather forecasts and they also help students get reasearch for homework assignments. I hope you greatly consider why I think they are a positive affect on people.",9
2200,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION3 has possesion of a computer, says @ORGANIZATION1. Intelligent people know that you need a computer. How could someone run a buisness without a computer, for example when they need to type or create an important logo online. Some people news are all from the interent, I'm sure of people wouldn't of heard about @ORGANIZATION4's earthquake without it. Another example is a lot of people can only communicate through email, or facebook, aim, etc. Maybe when someones out in @LOCATION4, they can't call so they email. Computers should not be banned! It's absolutley rediculous that someone would come up with such a horific idea. I mean a journalist like you should know this is a horrible ideal. How would you be able to finalize your papers to the news paper without a machine to type on? Are you going to hand write it on to the paper? Or how is someone's job to be a book keeper and hand write people's money, how's there job going to turn out? @PERSON1 a @NUM1 year old mom that has one child and a housband in @LOCATION4 hardly have a chance to communicate. Though when they do it's through email. That's it if she didn't have his email she'd never be able to know how he's doing if he's alright, and same with him. How could you possibly ban this. By banning computers you can make these people's lives more depressing and horrible then it already is know @CAPS1 away the internet from people can do extrem damage to buisnesses. Some buisnesses get all these ads from the internet. Sites like @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION3. What do you think will happen to the owners of those sights. Just we find after all the work they put into those sites. About @PERCENT2 of people buy almost half of there item that they give for gifts or clothes right from the inetrrent. So how could you take this away from them? This no computer ban is a bunch of bolonga! So what are you waiting for @CAPS2? Say no to this ban immidiatly. We most certainly should have computers! Intelligent people know that this idea is whacko. I hope you understand what I'm saying from this piece and make the right decision.",8
2201,"Dear, @LOCATION1 hour I am writing to you @DATE1 because I heard that people are writing to you about what they think aboute the effects computers have on people. I understand that computer can have positive and negative effects on people. I think computers have a negative effect on people. I think this because our generation spends way to much time in front of screens. Sure it @MONTH1 in prove hand eye coordination but it also give people an excuse to be lazy, and not get enough excersise which everyone needs. My secong reason is danger because there are all sorts of websites were kids can talk to strangers, they will never know who the person really is. For all they know it could be someone who wants to kidnap you because you believe they are someone they say they are. Sure they seem like a good person no one is really who they say they are and parents can't control what there kids do on there computers. My last reason is some kids might put inapropriete pictures on the internet, they think they can always delete them. But once some think is on the internet it never goes away. So you @MONTH1 think the computers help people, I beg to differ it's an excuse for people to be lazy and get no excersize. So in conclusion please take the time to think about what I have said and agree with me.",7
2202,"Dear The @CAPS1, Technology is the most advance thing in these days such as computers. People who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people, which I think its true. They give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, allow people to talk online with other poeple, and teachs hand-eye coordination. In my opinion, I believe that computers have an good effect on people. Many people would agree and think the same. How would people learn information about people and other places? The computer would help you out alot because it teaches you alot of information about places and people. Thats one reason why computer have on effect on people because they find out a whole lot of information, rather than going to a library and reading books. Also, too find out info. its not going to be that hard. For example the website that will help is @CAPS2.com. Its shows a lot of info about a person a places. Another reason why the computer has a positive effect on people is because it could allow people to talk online with other people. of course people would like to communicate with others online, cause it is better. Its better because you could do great things online such as, make an avatar, if you have myspace create a page and more. People chatting online would intrest other people to go online and start chatting. Computers teach hand-eye coordination which is very helpful in the world. It causes an positive effect on people who works with them and people who works like in offices and other places. Having Hand-eye coordination would help you with your typing and also will give the effects companys have on . Everyone who computer has a little hand-eye coordination. Well wouldn't you think computers has an positive effect on people. It does because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, allow people to talk online with, other people, and teachs hand-eye coordination. I truly believe that computers benefits society in many ways. Also it has an affect on people. So wouldn't you agree with me and other people who thinks computers has a effect on people.",9
2203,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my concern that people are dissag reeing on whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. Well, my opinion is that computers are very useful for people. @CAPS1 gives us a chance to socialize, learn about places, and even have online colleges tutoring! Please let me explain my ideas @CAPS2 you have friends that don't live close to you? Well, @CAPS3 so online chats like @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 chatting can help you reconnect with you friends. You friends don't even have to live faraway to chat with online. @CAPS1 could be a friend from schol that you want to have a discussion with. Online chatting is as great opportunity for people who want to make friends. Imagine, your a at home mom trying to take care of you family. There's no time for an education unline schools can save this problem you can earn a degree online and have to worry about having to go to school everyday. Don't have the money for education? no problems thats is for get unline tutoring are likely to get there great up by isnt @CAPS1 amazing? and, its free! There are so many places in the world with history history book. All you have to @CAPS2 is go on a search engine type in any faraway place and boom! thousands of facts in just the click of a mouse. @CAPS1's amazing isn't @CAPS1 why search through a history book for hours when all you really need to @CAPS2 is type in anthing on google and get instant knowledge. Faster and easier @CAPS1 is. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people in various ways. I hope my opinion have helped you realize that computers only benefit people.",8
2204,"Dear Readers, A gaining concern in @LOCATION1 today is the problem on computer. Do they benefit society you people advantage for doing through like @CAPS1, @CAPS2 games.com, or @LOCATION2..

Besides your family your friends and you outside family we the more important people in your life. with out them its a really lonley life for you.

2205,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there has lately been of controversy as to whether computers are benign of malovelent. I strongly support the position that computers are sabotaging our experience on @LOCATION2. First with computers around we never get enough exercise to with our @CAPS2. Furthermore, nature might never be enjoyed as much as @CAPS1 should be while computers still infest humans with their pestilance. Finally, with computers disease of distraction being encouraged among students, we will never be able to reach our academic potential. The only place where computers belong is the junu yard. In our new era of computers, exercising is slipping away slowly live the in an hour glass. @CAPS1 is an ominous fact that ever since the flood of computers throughout @LOCATION1 our childhood obesity rate has each year. I can still remember the good old days in second grade when I had friends over and the first thing we would do was around our neighborhood, but now a-days the only thing they seem interested in is playing videogames on the computer. Computers not only affect what we do while with friends, but also while we are alone. If someone is home alone and in one room is a set of weights and in the other rom is a computer, statistics show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teenagers would choose to go to the computer. Can't you see how computers are like the devil on our shoulder? Nature was meant to be experienced in person. Not from glance out the window while on the loading screen of a computer. Mostly once quoted that ""Computers are at the human love of nature and eventually there will be nothings left to collode. ""I have observed that every year that there are less and less people making their dog in. Is there really any other excuse for this other than the or computers. While computers are harmful in many ways, the leader or these are how they away at one academic potential. I understand tha the internet has many sources of useful information, but through a thorough survey of @PERSON1, I have found out that less than @PERCENT1 of all students use the computer as a source of information. If computers continue to vacate time that should be used for studying, than @LOCATION1's @ORGANIZATION2 will steadily descend down a path of darkness, and our future generations. In a study of @NUM3 students who studied and @NUM3 students who played on the computer, all or the students who studied scored higher than those who played on the computer, even though they studied math while the test was on science. Computers will continue to be the of our lives unless we put a wall in its path immediately.",10
2206,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know studies show @PERCENT1 of population doesn't get enough exercise? Also, that same @PERCENT1 wastes most of their time and money? The colprate for this are computers. Computers are a complete waste, not only are they unnecesary costs, they give out too much information. The even prevent users from getting exercise by doing something useful. I firmly believe computers have a bad and terrible effect on people. Computers are allways asking and giving out too much information. They ask for names, ages, and even street adresses. Believe it or not, most people will even give the computers this information. By doing this it is very unsafe and something you wouldn't want a computer to have. Out of all the deaths in our coutry, @PERCENT2on them are from murderers stalking computer users and hunting them down. This is not something I would want to happen to me or close friends. Als, people can easily lie. @NUM1 year old men can lie and say they are @NUM2 year old girls. They could trick you into being their friend this way too. So, why bother with a computer when it could be this dangerous? Some people think actually help you with things like hand-eye cordination. but, do you actually think computers can help? The whole time, you are just sitting and starring at a screen as it changes when you click your hand. this is not what you want to be doing. Obeasity is a very large issue for @CAPS2 and computers are not adding to resolve the issue. A local nutritionist told me,"" if everyone would not use computers and @NUM3 of this country would be obeas."" @CAPS3 of being lazy on the computer you could go on outside feeling the fresh air. Not only sit preventing exercise, it wastes alot of time. Websites on the computer try to be addicting so they can get alot of views, in fact there call addicting @LOCATION1. Whily your being glued to @CAPS4 websites your wasting lots of time that could be use for oppertunities like family game night or even homework. You can probly realize computers will obviously not help you. Computors have a fairly expensive lost that comes with it. They are not a cheap item and after you buy one you also have to pay for the electricty needed to run it. Just to add on you'll have to spend money on virus protection and office applications. People shouldn't waste so much money on a electronic that will waste your time, exspeciallyin such the many crisis we are all in today. A survey proved @NUM4 to or @NUM5 workers will work to save up computers. That money could be used for family vacations or sport programs, something worth it. unnecassary payments for a computer is not a good decision. Paying loads of money to look at a glowing screen is one of the worst things. I have heard of these computers will waste your time and prevent you from physical activity. Knowing it could potentially lead a murderer to you and give out your private information, now who would want thats I am fully against computors and the effect they have on people and so should you.",10
2207,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 would life be like with out computers? They are very important to @CAPS7 society. People use computers and other electronics everyday for their business, communication, or simply inst for leasure. @CAPS3 should be advances in computers because they teach people hand and eye coordination, are people the ability to learn about faraway places using the internet, and even talk on line with people miles away. To begin with, computers can help us develope hand and eye coordination. @CAPS2 is simply done when we type and look at the screen while we are writing a paper for class, responding to an e-mail, or even searching a word on @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON3, biologist that specializes in animal's hand and eye coordination says ""Hand and eye coordination is four in many and is important to the survival.

2208,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do computers really effect people as a whole? It has been brought to my attention that some people believe, the computer has negative effects on our society. I believe that these pieces of technology have a positive outcome on us. They give us the ability to learn about other places around the globe, it allows us to talk to friends and family and they also provide a source of entertainment. Don't you ever wonder what's outside the borders of our country? Well many @CAPS3 do now and then, With computers, we have the oppurtunity to learn about life styles different than our own. Just by surfing the web we can find all sorts of different information that we all crave. For instance, you can find out what types of food are eaten in @LOCATION1 with no hassle. With just click of a button, many different sources appear for easy arress. Wouldn't you like to discover what's out there with a click of a button? Aren't there any relatives of friends that live far away that you wish to speak too? Well, technology has given you an easy way to communicate called the computer. While online, you and just about everyone else can go in a chat room or e-mail/@CAPS4 session, which allows us to talk to one another. Family members can catch up on the latest news, while old friends can share favorite Even I use the computer to keep up with my family because they all live out or state.

They allow us to learn about other places around the globe you can use them to keep up with family and friends, and they can entertain us when we need it. Please take my arguements into consideration when choosing your side of this arguement.",9
2209,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a lot of effects on people. They could keep people from getting outside and enjoying the weather, which is a bad thing. Computers maybe good for interacting with people, such as family and friends, but they also maybe bad for our health. Computers have a big effect on people because they keep you from getting up and moving around. They keep you from excersing which could be a health problem. It's worse for children my age and older because all the social networking is keeping us from doing other things that we normally never do. Another effect that computers have on people is interacting with people you don't know or family members by using a webcam. It might be fun to talk to people you don't have a clue about, but you have to be careful because you don't know what's going on to happen after you finish talking to him/her. The lost effect that computers people is doing research. A lot of children have to do research on the computer. Whether it being for a project or for regular homework. This is a big effect because there are a lot of websites on the internet, and it's most likely that you're not going to find all the information that you need, because most of those websites talk about things that don't involve in the subject you're trying to search up. This is also a big affect because you could be sitting at your computer for hours and end up not finding anything. These are all the effects that I think computers have on people and maybe someday we could change them.",8

2211,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, ""Computers have become great advances in technology. However the way humans are being affected isn't in the most positive manner. It is nessesary for people to limit computer time."" according to world renown psychologist, @PERSON1. The question then is do computers affect humans in a positive or negative way. I firmly believe that this advance in technology isn't the best. Now adays with computers people aren't keeping to a diet and exercising. All they do is sit in front of the computer screen. By not getting the exercise every person needs people become overweight and obese which could also lead to other health problems. Could you picture yourself over the years slowing gaining pounds because you made the mistake of not exercising, but dillydallying on the computer? Then computers have also made people lazy. For example one might just send an e-card instead of a birthday card because they didn't ""feel up to"" getting out of the house. If people were training for a particular sport intensly and all of a sudden stopped due to the ""pull"" of their computer all of their previous hard work would be for nothing. The water is rushing by you as one arm goes in and the other out. Your feet are kicking, but slowly your hours of training seem to be disappearing and being replaced by computer time. Due to the effect of computers people aren't even able to enjoy nature. The beautiful trees are growing and the rose bushes are blooming magnificent flowers, however almost no one notices them anymore. Everything outside is lovely but people don't experience it because of this technology. People today aren't even receiving fresh air fromstaying inside all cooped up. According to the @ORGANIZATION1 in every @NUM1 people who have @ORGANIZATION1 will have a more severe case if they don't get the recommended amount of fresh air needed. Since people don't even enjoy nature anymore because they are on computers all day they care for it less as well. I have observed that whenered people are outside they just dispose of their garbage in a horrible manner, and don't pay attention to where it might end up. I can understand the point of view that you can meet and make new friends online, however this in a sense causes one to lessen interaction with friends and family. Smart and well informed people will not spend large somes of time on the computer to stop interaction with others. Some other people though seem to be caught in their own little world on the computer. It is extremly easy for people to lose friendships because of the computer. I know this from personal experience since I too used to spend to much time on it. I had been spending so much time on the computer that one of my friends became fed up with me and wouldn't really talk to me after it. Then also one's family might feel abandoned by a person from the excessive time spent on this technology. There it is time to realize that computers have a bad effect on people. Almost no one receives their daily exercise to keep them healthy. People then also forget about nature and how to enjoy it. Most of all though it clearly affects the relationships between friends and family. Therefore it is time to take action.",11
2212,"There have been many advances in technology over the last hundred years, one of which, being the computer. Though, this invention has benefitted humanity greatly, it has also had many negetive effects as well. Three of these neagtive effects are people are spending to much time online and less time execising, interacting with friends and family, and last but not the least, cyber bullying. Recently, many kids, student, and adults of all ages have spent much more time with computers and videogames when they could be spending that time on other outdoor activities such as sports, biking, hiking, etc. Through studies have shown that computers can teach hand-eye coordination, @CAPS1 sure that you could learn that much better by doing some other physical activity. Also, with the of exercise due to technology like computers, many more people have become overweight and the problem can only get worse. Now-a-days people commonly rely on computers for simple things such as news and communication. Since almost everything is available online these days, many people dont find the need to leave there own home anymore. As computers become slowly more entertaining to a individuall, they dont find the need of interactions of friends and family anymore for entertainment. Would you like to have a anti-social son or daughter because I know it wouldn't. This is just another reason that shows how computers have had a negative affect on us.",8
2213,"Dear local newspaper, I don't think that computers effect people instead I think it makes them smarter. One example that can support my opinion is that when you researh online you get to understand more stuff. Another example that can support my opinion is that you can chat with people from other contrys. My last example is that you can surch about your absesters if you dont know nothing about them. These examples shows how computers can make you smater. When you reserch online you get to understand. more stuff. For example if you need help with your school work and you dont have no one to help you, you could use the computer and it will help you understand what you need to understand. Maybe you need more information on a topic if you research about it the computer will help you. This is important because computer can make you understand topics you dont know about. My second example is that you can chat with people from other contrys and learn about their habitat. For example while your chating with them they could tell you stuff you dont know about their contry. This is important because you could learn stuff about other contrys. My last examples that you can surch about yoor ansesters if you dont know nothing about them. For example you could find out stuff you did not know about them. This is important because you get to know about you. Tradition more. Like from where they come from how many generations are in your family and more stuff.

You can get in trouble too, if you tell some one you age, name, or even you adress, stranger can come to you house. And if you like you computer alot and you like to download alot of softeare you can get alot of virusis much leads to mesing up you computer. And there is a thing call spyhore wore some one can hack or you computer is already hacked some on might be hocking what you are doing on the computer and it is not good because you can use it is not good because you can use it for bad thing like hocking things, like computers, sites, sometimes, and much more. And it is a must of money because it can set messed up and just for one computer is like. But it is usefull for life beacuse you can get stuff and order stuff you can buy thing on the internet like household apliences, and thing you can have fun with for example a toy, if you are looking for a car toy and no one has it that lives around you, you can just go on the computer and look it up.",8

I am working on a project in history class about @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6, The I chase was @PERSON1, or great secretary of stud and military leader, there aren't many books in our library about him so I go straight to the computer. The computer always have information on any topic or object last week I look a survey, and over @PERCENT1 of all the students in my school use the computer and internet for either there homework or projects. That is one reason how computers have a positive affect on people and children. Using the computer can also help you interact with friends, family or even people you don't knew and would like to meet. Almost @PERCENT2 of all adults over the age of @NUM1 have @CAPS7 or @CAPS8. On those webistes you are able, in meet new people and talk to your friends. I have a @CAPS8 account and it is good people meet new people and become more with their lives. I have more provids on my account and I can talk to them all the them. The by if for example that are still while we in the @LOCATION1. My mother keeps with our relatives in @LOCATION2 by @CAPS8 on its tiny are still with us. That is my secon computer people everyday. Computers are for buy in the . Using this you are not money because you can as much time and the object. Last your for my birthday I on that as in @CAPS9 car and I got over @NUM2 million hits. I reasearched the cars and round the one the suited me and was not less expensive. I believe that researching objects can save you time and many. For example, if you go to a store and the store does not have the item then you just lost aproxiounetely @NUM3 hours. You @MONTH1 also waste money becasue if you just search the object you want, then you are able to see where the lowest price is. The computer can save a tirp to a store by just ordering your item right from the internet. My mother always busy my shoes and her paper online because she does not have the time to go shop for one. That is my last reason why computers really do have a positive affect on people. Now you how why computers have a positive affect on peoples lives everyday. Computers help students leanr about topics for school, they help people interact with other people and save you time and money while shopping for items. I strongly suggest that you agree with my arguement, computers affect and help everyone with their lives. P.S. strongly recomend you agree with my argument.",11
2216,"I strongly support advances in technology. Computers make tasks very simple. You can talk to your family the internet, play a game, do school work and hundreds of other tasks that you wouldn't be able to do as well as you @CAPS5 with a computer. My entire immediate family lives in @LOCATION1. All of them. Every aunt, uncle, grand parent and cousins don't live near me at all. It costs an insane amount of worry to make international calls to them, so I don't. I connect with my family through instant message, e-mail and @CAPS1. (A social networking site) I can post pictures to @CAPS1 as can my relatives, and I can cousins grow up. All @NUM1 of them. My cousin @PERSON1 and I talk almost every day through the computer. We're tighter than spandex on a guy and yet, we live hundreds of miles apart. that allow my family to connect. my essays have you type up? do you recieve via e-mail, @PERSON2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4? I'm you rely on computers to get information, just as much as you need to create spreadsheets and This was certainly The itself @CAPS5 you imagine if you had to draw each these up? Four something for every greater take give you some idea as to how important computers are to society. I know that some people would say that @ORGANIZATION1's aren't important ( agree) but, to you, they must be very important you administer This might you by surprise. My eh? Or maybe a bunch of people do I can see how one would become obese from spending every free moment on the computer. I haven't met one overweight person who isn't aware that they are overweight. Some choose to do something about it, such as myself. Some people are ditching their social for @CAPS6. (@CAPS7 @CAPS8 Online @CAPS9 @CAPS10) @CAPS11? not really, @CAPS12? Definitely. People usually know when they aren't exercising or not having a social life. They just choose to not do anything about it, and this is not society's fault, so why are we being blaimed for it? You don't know? Neither do I. In conclusion, computers are wonderful tools for those who utalize them appropriately.",8
2217,"I strong it hurt people are using computers to they are not enjoying nature. Some people like my brother, he first the day the computer soccer he doesn’t want to go. I think they stop making computers to tried to make people the nature. See if the stop ussing the computer. People go to the computer to talk to other people look at the web to see if they a new computer to buy. Finally, I now i that they should stop making computer to people to explor the nature with there fimaly.",4
2218,"Dear Newspaper, I don't think that we spend to much time on them because we go to school work we go outside and we and not everbody has them. This is why I think that we don't spend that much time on the computers. Everybody mostly gos to school or work witch means less time on the computer and as they drive to school or work they will be able to look at the nature. And also most kids and adualts go to school or work for at least eaght hours a day. witch keeps them of the computer for quight a while. Also from my exsperence what I do and most my friends do is go on the computer when we get home checck our facebook, myspace, youtube, and aim acconts the get off and go hangout after we hang out I will go on the computor for like @NUM1 hours a day thats all. That is one reson why I think that we don't use computers that much. Most people go outside once a day or more @CAPS1 that I go outside everday to bmx or go to an @CAPS2 skatepark. Also many people cannat afrod computers there for they never go on computer. So they go outside and sit on the streets and do nothing also many people love to go outside and just have fun out there and not be on the computer @NUM2, and also many people would probly get bored of sitting on the computer all day I no I would be very bored @CAPS3 I was on the computer all day. So I would go outside. That is my second reason why I think we don't use computers that much. Lastly not everbody has one. The reson not everbody has them is because not everbody got the money to be a computers even @CAPS3 they by a computer they might not be able to pay the internet bill witch means this will keep them of the computer because its no fun without the internet. Also some people don't have them because they don't want one. someoder people do not want the new technolgy because there use to having what they had when the were a kid growing up also @CAPS4 might be to complecated for some of the old people to use a computer. That is my thrid reson I think we do not use computers that much. To wrap @CAPS4 all up I think we don't use computers that much because of school and work being outside and lastly not everbody has them to be used. That is why we are not using computers to much.",9
2219,"Dear: Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that people are using computers for positive effects. The technology of the computer gives people the ability to learn, talk to friends, and also look online for other important reasons. The technology of a computer helps people with hand-eye coordination. I think computers are a positive effect to benefit society. People all around the world use computers for different reason @CAPS1 is a great thing that we have technology like computers now in days. My first reason is about using the computer for the ability to learn. Sometimes students need a computer to help them in a sertend subjet for example: a kid needs help with math there websites that he or she can go on to help them get better with math. Theres website's teachers might give you or also there's websites you can go on like @CAPS2 brain, master math, and other cool, fun, but still educational website for kids to learn. I think computers can be very helpful for student, kids that need a little more help then others. So that was my first reason so lets go to the next reason. My next reason is that teenagers have the ability to talk to friends the internet. I think thats better then having you kids out doing drugs and drink and get them in trouble. Its a great idea to have a computer because then your kids can have fun talking to there friends online teens can run up there phone bills. And teen dont only have to talk to friends online they can talk to family members that dont live near by. Teens these day love using computers so parent should say no to hanging out with bad people and say yes to talking ever the computer. My third reason is that kids, teens, grown ups can go online for other importants reasons. For example familys might want to go on trips and they want to go online to see were they want to go and stay at. Also familys might be looking for fansie restaurants to eat for a special ocation. So keep in mind computers always come in handy. For prepases like kids need to get better in a subject teens want to talk with friends online, or family vacations. Well thats all I had to say I just want to say one more thing keep this in mind!",9
2220,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I believe people shouldn't spend their time on computers all the time. Most people that spend all day on the @CAPS4 develope poor social skills, and health problems. Some supporters that like that computers help develope hand-eye coordination, and help people learn about the people and places around the world. Social skills are a necessity to life. People need to know how to interact with others so they can function in susiety. When gamers or computer addicts don't socially involve themselves they become afraid or shy. to be able to have many different kind of jobs its crutial to know how to do buisness with people by talking and being social. Lazy people that just want to stay inside all day and video chat or playing video games online can develope health problems from not being physically active. A friend of mine became diabetic because he would eat lots of junk and not go outsided to burn off all the bad sugars in his body. People @MONTH1 develope diseases were they are dependent on people to take cure of them because they are too afraid of people outside their games world. People can lose contact with the outside world. They might forget where they are or if something happened right down the street they wouldn't know. Computers can have many up-sides to the like learning and hand-eye coordination but there are more down-sides to them than up. If people are on the computer all the time learning about distant places they would spend all their time going online to see it insted of acctually going. I support my idea's of computers harming people if they spend all day @NUM1 on the because of social problems later on in life. Health risks from not being active, and loss to the outside world. These are my reason's why I stand firmly about my opinion.",8
2221,"Dear Local Newspaper, Some people think that using computers benefit the society and some don't. My position on this matter is that it doesn't benefit the society. Mt theories are they use the computer a lot and they don't get out their houses and don't exersice and they don't know how good it feels to go outside just to enjoy it and they also don't know how their family and friend are doing because they haven't talk to them them in a because are computer. Some people don't and exercise because of computers. People are stock on the computer just won't have to exercise just recently my weight and be spent all told him that and so he now had free time and be started to work out and he got fit. But for his birthday she bought him a laptop now he doesn't go to the @CAPS1 to workout he goes to on his laptop and now he's getting big again. You see when he had a somputer he was they took it away he lost weight but when he got back in the all back, and it all because of the computer. Being outside good its in the @DATE1 you can camp or swim in pools in which you can but you have a computer. You stay on your laptops and don't get time to go out because you've wasted time on the computer. You can do the but you don't don't get the some you do when you do go outside. The computers you affect your go on the computer to talk or family and friends but it doesn't feel the same as seeing them in person. According to student studies @PERCENT1 of people who spend most time on computer than seeing family are like to have postamatic stress. What is that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are stress out from not talking or seeing family and friends due to spend too much time on computers. Yes we know @CAPS2 and playing are fun but it costs out time you could be spending with friends and family or @CAPS2 outside and exercising to be healthy and fit. So what are you @CAPS2 to do sit there on the computer or go and enjoy life!?",8
2222,"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 kids looking down on their hand just to see what they are doing. @CAPS1 curious people wanting to know about faraway place but can’t. @CAPS1 relatives not being able to talk to their nieces, nephews or grandchildren. Computer fix that by improving hand-eye coordination, educational purposes and allow a degree of communication. I believe computer are a huge technical advancement in our time. First, computers help with hand-eye coordination. Sports @CAPS2 said that kids do well in sports due to fast reflexes from hand-eye coordination. Also, parents noticed their kids are multi-tasking more easily. Experts also say that kids are writting faster thanks to hand-eye coordination. Next, computers are a huge part of education. There are many courses that people can take online. Dr. @DR1, a social studies @CAPS3, says that its easier to teach class with online activities. Also, in @CAPS3’s magazine, a poll shows that that out of @NUM1 students @NUM2 would rather study online than from a book. Computers can really make school more interesting. Finally, computers have a degree of communication. Kids can also contact their relative from around the world. Also, advertisements are posted on the web. Buisness men say that @PERCENT1 of their advertisments is online. Phycologys say that kids can build their communication skills online. Now @CAPS1 kids using effective ways to study,playing sports, and talk to their relatives whenever they want. Computers improve hand-eye coordination, help educate, and improve communications. So @PERSON1 post my artical to explain how useful computers can be!",8
2223,"Computers are a fairly new invention. Years ago, computers were so big it took a whole room to store one, but now, with advances in tecnology, laptops centimeters than, and touch screen @CAPS1 have become regular sights in homes all across @LOCATION1, but is this a good thing? Computers can help people learn new things, teach hand-eye coordination, and can introduce to a bunch of great new people. Therefore, I would say, yes computers are a good thing, and every citizen should have one. Years' ago, if a student needed to look up facts for a project, he/she would have had to go all the way to library to get that information, and the back they need could already be checked at! Now what? Because of @ORGANIZATION1, another search engines, info is available with the click of a button, therefore this problem would never have come up. Futhermore, @ORGANIZATION1 also has pictures that are free an easily asseside. But that's not all, all the latest news and celebrity gossip is available as well! You can quickly, easily, and conviently find out about important events like the earthquake in @LOCATION2 and you could donate money to help the cause as well. More information can only be a good thing, and that's not all a computer Have you ever wanted to be good at sports like tennis, or baseball, but never had enough hand eye coordination? Well studys show that @PERCENT1 of people who played online games for at least an hour a week got better hand-eye coordination in @NUM1 weeks! Games like @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and similar precludes challenge the mind and body to work together and make the body stronger, faster and more which would help to do everyday like driving cars. Furthermore, most people don't play sports because they good of them, but with better reflexes and a quick mind, they could improve at these sports, and help to solve @LOCATION1's obesity problem. This could only be a good thing. Computer's are the key to the char of wellness, all @LOCATION1 must do is provide a hand to learn this key. One of the main concerns for computer critics is that people will spend too much time on the computer, and not enough time interacting with family and friends, however, on the contrary, I feel that computers @CAPS4 the bands between people say someone had a reletive or friend who lived very far away from then, so they never got to see then. Well with a computer, this person could email, I. My or even video chat this person anytime they wanted! Aus, computers allow people to not only talk to known friends, computers also allow users to meet new people and possibly make new friends! Furthermore, computers can help to boost the confidence and self-esteam of shy people. I know that before I started using a computer I was quiet and always scared of what other people would think but taking online helped to boost my confidence, and I'm taking more and making new friends outside of the computer as well as inside. More confident, friends and social people are what say country would want for citizens. Therefore, computers ant the awful burden to society that critics have made then out to be, in bet, computers are great for many things, including learning new things, better hand-eye coordination, and meeting new people, therefore we should encourage everyone to buy a computer today!",10
2224,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 some people @MONTH1 be concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer, many experts can argue that computers are a wonderful things. Did you know that more than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 own a computer? That is because computers help you gain skills that are used multiple times throughout your life. Also, with a computer, people can gain instant access to anything they need. One last reason is that many people use computers to keep in touch with friends or relatives, perhaps those who live far away. It @MONTH1 seem that a computer plays a big role in one's life, and truth is, they @CAPS6 continue helping people build foundations for future careers and goals. Many times, when you look for a job, you have to fill out a resume. A resume shows the business owner @CAPS5 skills you have and @CAPS5 skills you're willing to put forward to help the company. Nowadays, more and more companies have started using computers and knowing how to use one is a basic necessity. ""I'm on a computer every day at work filing claims, doing paperwork, and helping customers,"" says @PERSON1, an insurance under writer in @LOCATION1. If she did not have good typing skills, great hand-eye coordination, and excellent word processing skills, she wouldn't have been hired for the job. The young generation is getting an early start on building that foundation that they @CAPS6 use throughout their futures it @CAPS6 sure come in handy someday. Say you're a reporter for channel @NUM1 @ORGANIZATION1. There's a breaking story that your audience needs to hear as soon as possible. You log onto your computer to find instant information on the story. Your twitter feed is exploding with the exciting @ORGANIZATION1 and now you have material to report on for your @ORGANIZATION1 report. The moral is, with a computer people gain instant access to @ORGANIZATION1, whereas, they might have to wait hours for the local @ORGANIZATION1 report, or in this case, they are the reporter looking for. Resident of @LOCATION3, @PERSON2 says ""The @CAPS3 homepage is one of my daily fixes. I check it multiple times a day!"" overall, that goes to show that people all over the world can be aware of the latest happenings on their planet. The last, and possibly most important reason for computers is to keep in touch with people. You can easily sign onto @CAPS4 and talk with your cousin who lives all the way in @LOCATION2. Or the friend that you miss who only lives an hour away. One knows that social networking is a daily stop, and it's an awesome way to keep in contact. @PERCENT2 of the people in the world have some type of instant messenger all their, a recent study showed you just have plans with your friend and can't remember @CAPS5 time to meet. A quick virtual message saying ""@CAPS5 time do you want to go?"" @CAPS6 solve your problem. That is instant communication at its' finest. I hope that you're convinced that computers are after all a great thing. People build everyday life skills, they have fast access to the latest @ORGANIZATION1, and you can keep in touch with people that you don't normally get to talk to. Now, which one of the @PERCENT3 of @CAPS2 who don't own a computer are going out to buy one? In conclusion, computers help people through daily life, and I would sure hope you consider purchasing one.",9
2225,"Hortford @CAPS1, I believe that the effects of computers are negative. There are mainly @NUM1 ideas why I think they are negitive. First reason is @CAPS2. The computer effects your @CAPS2 because your sitting on a choir. Stairing at the bright computer screen for @NUM2 to @NUM3 hrs. While you could be outside exercising. Runnig around having a great time with friends and family. Second reason is @CAPS3. The computer effects your @CAPS3 because you sit at your computer playing games or on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 but your not learning anything. You should be doing homework or you could write on essay. You should be writing or reading everyday. Last reason is recycle. While your on the computer you probly printed @NUM1 or @NUM2 papers and thats a waist of paper. You just killed a tree. Trees and flowers are what give us air and were killing tress for computer paper. Now do you see why the effects of the computer are bad and I hope you agree.",6
2226,"Computers are one of the most important forms of technology in society today. There are so many different ways to use them, and they are a major tool for success in @CAPS1, education and engineering. They teach hand-eye coordination, allow people to learn about most anything and can be used for communication between people who live far away. I think computers are a great tool and that they should be more positively recognized for all the good they help people do every day. Computers teach us many things. We learn hand-eye coordination from moving the mouse with our hands and seeing the cursor on the screen move too. Babies can also learn special software about colors and sounds. Interactive games help children of all ages learn and undersatand the things around them. My cousin loved looking at the computer screen when she was a baby. It really helped her to learn about colors and sounds, as it does for many babies. Computers are a very good early learning tool. Without computers, I don't see how I would be able to know so much about places I have been to. Sure books help, but I bet a lot of information found in books was originally on the internet or atleast double checked using the internet. The computer also has more visuals and pictures of what distant places look like. I @MONTH1 never really see the great wall of @LOCATION2, but I can atleast get an idea of what it looks like from photos taken a postedl to a website. The computer can be used for finding nearly any type of information and really helps people understand too! A few years ago, my best friend moved away to a differrent state. I was really sad to see her go, but I felt better that I could email her and send her pictures of what was going on here in @LOCATION1. Through the computer, we have stayed friends and are now able to instant message every night to keep in touch. Friends are not the only people who do this, however, @CAPS1 corperations talk to other corperations over a webcam. A person who couldn't attend a meeting can log on and see what their co-workers are saying, almost as if they were really there. Online communication is a really great tool to use in @CAPS1 and normal life alike. So, computers @MONTH1 have a few miner drawbacks but overall they are a great advancemant in technology and a huge part of our society. They teach important skills, give information about almost anything and provide a quick, easy form of communication to just about anywhere in the world. Overall, computers are a great resource and can help people today in so many ways. I believe that computers have a very positive affect on people in our world today.",9
2227,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know, the @NUM1 century is often referred to @CAPS1 the @CAPS2 of Technology due to the fact that many technological advances have been achieved. One of these such advantages is the computer. These have been disputes over whether the computer benefits society, or damages it. @CAPS1 helpful @CAPS1 the computer @MONTH1 be, it ultimately does not benefit society in the long run. Exessive use of the computer causes health problem, prevents people from enjoying nature and does not promote actual @CAPS3 to @CAPS3 inteaction with others. Many health problems today have been associated with the excessive use of electronics and computers. High blood pressure, obesity and strain on the eyes and hands can somehow be connected to computer. These are problems that @MONTH1 impact ones ability to work and could pose severe health hazards. Obesity and high blood pressre coupled together greatly hightens the risk of heart disease while eye and hand problems @MONTH1 greatly reduce the ability to function in and outside of a home environment. In fact, a recent study shows that @NUM2 out of every @NUM3 excessive computer users suffers some kind of health problem. In conjuction, Computers also prevent many people from going outside and interacting with nature, whether it be playing outside or simply taking a walk. Studies taken by @ORGANIZATION1 show that these simlpe interactions help reduce stress and work wonders for our own health. However, a vast majority of people do not experience this due to the fact that they are constantly distracted by the lure of the computer. In another study, it shows that these inteactions also help improve happiness levels and would result in a much happier person. But, like so many of us we do not go outside to enjoy the simply joys in life. Last, computers do not promote @CAPS3 to @CAPS3 contact. Although many would that computers help people across the globe interact with one another, it does not promote the actual to the human psyche. Studies conducted by varrous laboratories around the world all agree that the human mind craves for person to person contact. The computer cannot provide this contact, therefore the mind of a crucial past of our lifestyle. Due to these computers, society and our own bodies are slowly but surely being damaged in a way that could be irreversable.",10
2228,Dear the @ORGANIZATION1 I think that computers are positive to people. I say that because people could use a computer for there colledge work. Also we can use it to find out more about things like @CAPS1. The computer will give us more details about it. The computer can help us with writing if are hands are hurting or your arm is broken you can use it to type. Plus the computer can help us print out pictures because if we don't know how to draw a picture than all we have to do is go on the computer to print out things. We can also use the computer for directions like if we can't afford a gps we can use the computer to print out directions. We can also use the computer to buy things like a car if we can not find the dealership we can go on the computer and buy one and have shiped off to us. So that is why computers are positive to people.,6
2229,"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently read from my next door neighbor that the @ORGANIZATION1 wants to know peoples opinion on the advantages of computers. Mark the science specealist says that @PERCENT1 of people think that computers are bad. The other @PERCENT2 think computers are awsome. In my opinion computers are great. First of all, computers help people learn their hand-eye coordination. Computers are future. By typing on the computer all the time you barn that your fingers have a mind of their own, @PERCENT3 of my second grade english class learned how to type. The other @PERCENT4 learned after. My mother learned how to type when she was @NUM1. She is now @NUM2 and just getting hand-eye coordination. By the children learning how to type they will have hand-ey coordinaiton by their teen years. Secondyl, when you go on vacation you can still be at school. By having computers no one any exusests miss school. My friend @PERSON1 lives in @LOCATION1 and come over to she was on the computer for @TIME1. When she went back to school her teacher didn't have to go out of her way to teach her. By having computers people can go anywhere. @PERSON1 traveled across the world and did it! So having computers is a huge advantage when it comes to vacation or even being sick. Lastly, computers have a posative advantage/ outcome on people. By people not having to deal with having writer's cramp because you could type. have you ever gotten a writing cramp? If you have you know that it is very uncomfortible. Doctors have prmen that people will put more on paper when they type, also that getting writer's cramp can cause arthritous in your hand. Everybody gets writer's cramp even pre-k children. The little kids are always coloring. In conclusion, I think that having computers is a very good advantage. By helping with handeye coordination hey help people when they go away on vacations, and computers have a posotive outcome on people. So you see computers aare very helpful. You should like computers too.",9
2230,"Dear newspaper, I would like to let you know that, I think computers are a great product to use. People are able to do all thngs with computers. Including checking email or chat with friends. We also are able to see ehat the weather will be like instead of waiting for the @CAPS1 to come on learning about places out of state or in another country, can be activated with the touch of a mouse. Without checking email everyday my mom would be lost and would not know what to do. She makes sure sports and appointments are not cancelled. IF she were not to have email, we would drive all the way to the places and just have to go back. Email saves so much time for everyone. Online chatting is another good way to see your friends, and talk about things. The only bad thing is that your not getting some fresh or at the same time. You can meet so many new people and expand your friendship. Weather needs to be checked all the time by people to make sure the roads wont be bad or to wonder about a baseball game. My dad makes me also get on the computer and go to weatherchannel.com. This is because he us learning for work the next day and does not want it to snow. The good thing about getting the weather online is that if is so quick, when you would have to wait for the @CAPS1 to come on and tell you. It could waste a lot of time. And if the computer is bad, isn't the couch bad too? How about the video tour? yes, the computer will give you one of those for your favorite place. You are now able to go places without the plane. You can go on the computer now research the place you want. This helps on projects, because they are able to get everything they need to know and put it onto a paper. This could also help people decide where to go for a trip. If you want to go to @LOCATION1, then you search it and could find out how much it would cost, or what places to visit while there. The effects that computers have on us, are not bad, you just want to use it more. Yes go on when they get home, but at school they have recess and gym. People don't get fat if they sit on the computer, they get fat depending on what they eat. You should really be tring to fight eating adiction not computer adiction.",9
2231,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, The effects computers can have on people can be good, and bad. I happen to think computers are a good help to the society. Having a computer is like having your own little reference to anything. Would you rather go out and by a ton of books, and talk to a lot of people, or just sit at home and find what you need immediately? Everybody now just wants it to be quick and simple. Next, just like before, there are kids with homework. When people have research to do for homework, they go on the computer. So, having a computer isn't such a waste of time. Although kids and people can get distracted, but hopefully they will spend their time wisely. A computer is what this century uses, and needs. Sometimes, a computer can have the wrong information, but these is more than one sights. If you compare a computer to a book, your information is more limited with the. Have you ever mised the news on television and was eager to learn ? Well the computer is neede them too. The computer teaches you, and informs you what is going on in day life. If you think about it, the television will the news, but the computer can probably inform you. The television is. If there are certain places you need to go of learn about, the fastest way is the computer. Are you understanding my point, @CAPS2, the computer is an easier way of communication. These are many instant messaging sites, or a friendly environment, for ex. facebook. Being able to talk to people on lie computer is less complicated, you killing to a at people. The different variety at people that use the computer to talk probably get rid at their phone and the bill because no one uses it. You can also connect with people in different countries or. If you have a family, you can learn each others traits, and see the difference in religion. The more you know and learn, the more knowledgable and comfortable you'll be if you visit. That is a great experience to rope for. In conclusion, a computer isn't just a waste of time. The computer is just a piece of material that is filled with information and ways to conect with people @CAPS3 is bad about it, unless someone uses it the wrong way, or is distracted. Try to understand, that there is everything you can possibly need to know on the computer!",9
2232,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has been a very interesting question going around lately. Do computers do more positive or negative acts for people? My guess is that they cause much harm for the human race computers are causing many teens and young adults to be unhealthy. Computers are also very expensive, and seem to take away the hand in family. Computer are not enhancing our physical or mental environment. Computers are keeping teens and adults cooped up inside rather than enjoying the natural outdoors. It is important that they get outside or go to the gym in order to stay healthy. Computers seem to be holding them back. A @CAPS2 named @PERSON1 did some research and in a survey of fifty teens only eight of them would rather be outside or exercising rather than going on facebook all day. Computers are bringing down our rate of health. Because of computers people would rather surf the web and order their groceries rather than go to the store and walk around the aisles. Local gym owner @PERSON2 @CAPS3 that since computers have been the cool treend his gym members have been cancelling memberships because they don't have time to get to the gym. they don't have time because they are too busy walking on computer games. Gym have gone down about @PERCENT1 , yet hte computers keep . Computers and the take their toll on people . It is to a point when people are planning schedules around their computer life. Locak bakery @PERSON4 @CAPS3 taht people make and are late to them up because they were busy world and got caufht up in happy . Computers are to yet invesive in peoples lives, and it is . the through, "" you @MONTH1 look any way you want on the had you will always be your real self, so stop living virtually! ""@CAPS3 of country cuts"" in @LOCATION1 @CAPS4. Computers can be helpful, but to a certain extent. Take my advise and change your life style. Computers are quite expensive especially when everyone is tight on money these days. People are paying extra for games, internet, and even everyday softwear! People are so addicted to computers and they will pay any price for that little satisfactor of going on a pointless website. Computers are having a large impact on us and on our packets. We have been spending too much on computers. Best @CAPS5 cahser @PERSON3 @CAPS3 I never thought people would go out of their way to pay this much crazy"" which goes to prove that the human race will give up their money for computers rather the things family vacations. America needs to smarten ups and stad forgetting computers because they are only going to hurt us.",9
2233,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 respect my opinion. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. There are three major reasons why I think that. They are: they help people with hand-eye coordination, the ability to learn about faraway places and people increases, and to talk online with others. @CAPS2 respect my opinion; I will defend it throughout the rest of my paper. My first reason defending my opinion is that it helps with hand-eye coordination. This will help you in all sports. Mostly, all sports involve hand-eye coordination . By using it with typing and the computer; it can increase your sport skills. For example, baseball is a sport that needs alot of hand-eye coordination. Typing on the computer and looking up at the screen, at the same time can help you in baseball. It can help you by seeing when the ball is coming and then you swing. That is coming and then you swing. That is my first reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. My second reason why I think computers have a positive result on people is because they allow you to learn about faraway places and people. For example, if you have a project to do on @LOCATION1 you can search it online and get all of the information you need. A lot of new things have been invented for the computer including languages. So, if you need to learn a language and you don't have time to go to a class; you can learn online the same way. That is my second reason why I think computers have a positive outcome on people. My third reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people is because they get to talk online to people, either through a network, video or audio. For example, if part of your family lives in @LOCATION2, then you can talk to them without the money. You can use networks like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, or by e-mail. For video messages you can use ooVoo, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS5, etc. You can also use those networks for audio. By interacting over the internet. It is bringing you closer to your family - not farther. That is my third reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, I think that more than half of the effects computers have on people are positive. My three reasons are: hand-eye coordination, learning about faraway places and people, and to talk online. @CAPS2 respect my opinions.",9
2234,"Dear @CAPS1 @NUM1 eye witness news, I have been putting my attention torwds the use of computers. I have noticed that more and more fellow @CAPS2 are indeed addicted to the technology. My concern is that they don't get enough exersize. The other thing I'm worried about is the lack of comunication in families. But my final consern is the safty of your children @CAPS3 a daily exersize rotine is important in every ones life. Well for example, you don't have to struggle watching your weight because you'll be set. In other words your staying fit and focas. But more importantly your keeping yourself healthly. I think that the technology is keeping us from being able to succeed in our health life. I believe that is their wasn't as much internet accees that wouldn't be a problem with the obesity conserns. Communication in any healthy relationship is goal. It's good to talk as a family. I feel that the computer use is keeping us from doing so. Teen agers are hooked on ""@CAPS4 on @CAPS5, twitter, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1!, @ORGANIZATION2"" ect. These websites keep teenagers away from the outside world and family communication. Our society is being brain washed with these new cyber space onlien cummuinities. Your childerns safty is at risk! These online cummunities are putting your child in some serious trouble. These are millions of kids signed on to ""@CAPS7, @CAPS5, twitter, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1!, @ORGANIZATION2"". But as many kids there are there will be more sex-offenders, @CAPS10, and harmful people. Letting your child log on to these is pretty much exposing them into the arms of those people. Remenber its never safe to put any type of information that can harm you or your loved ones. So, I believe that the computer use is just a way to keep you from doing a great life. We all know that we don't want to get hurt so I think that we should limit our computer use. But if your child has one of the websites that were mention please watch out for them.",8
2235,"Imagine having the whole world in a screen in front of you. With the @CAPS1 you can socialize more. You can also learn more, quicker and get insperation for things to do away from the computer. I believe that the computer benefits the society. There are so many things on the computer to make socializing more efficient. Rather than sending letters in the mail, which wastes paper, you can send emails to your friends email address. If you want to have a conversation, instead of calling someone far away and get long distance fees, you can talk to them with a webcam. To get in touch with old or new friends you can use social networking sites which are becoming more and more popular. The computer makes socializing easier. If you wanted to learn about a new topic without a computer you would have to drive to the library search for a book then come back to the library to return it. This might discourage some kids from learning. If they used a computer they would quickly be able to find the information they needed on the @CAPS1 without any of the hassel. With this time saver they might have time to learn more about different topics. The computer makes it a lot easier to learn. There are a lot of sites that might inspire people to go out and have fun. For example, if you are learning about animals you would quickly be able to find the nearest zoo and how much it costs. There are even sites with cupons to save money while you are out having fun. There are even sites to tell you where it is fun to go as a family. The computer can inspire fun trips with your friends or family. Overall, the computer has a lot of benefits. It makes socializing and gaining knowledge easier. It can also inspire you to go out and have fun. The computer benefits society.",8
2236,"Computer are good to have in society. They teach people about far away places, helps me socailize and lets the person relax. Computers teach people about far away places. You see I have trouble learning about @LOCATION1 when I was there because I can'@CAPS2 understand what they so the internet it in @CAPS1, plus certain places I want to learn about I can'@CAPS2 go to since it is dangerous. Since I am @NUM1 I can'@CAPS2 use a plane to travel because I'm young. My parents don'@CAPS2 have the money to travel so the computer helps me learn about these places. The computer helps me socailize on a regular basis. I can talk to my family in @LOCATION1 since I can'@CAPS2 go there. I can talk to ,my friends which is nice since I can'@CAPS2 see them often. Sometimes y I can send emails which doesn'@CAPS2 cost me a penny oppered to writing a letter which costs money. A comuter also allows you to make your e-mails neat, opposed to messy writing. Computers @MONTH1 help some people relax. You could pay alot of games. Some are even multi player so more than one person can play. You can play music from the internet and then download it. On top of that you can even watch some shows that you missed or @CAPS2.V. so you won'@CAPS2 miss out. Finally you can get your own virtual form. Computers aren'@CAPS2 always bad for the society. There are some good qualities like socailizing, relaxing, and learning about faraway places. So the computer isn'@CAPS2 that bad.",7
2237,"Dear local Newspaper, I agree with the experts. I think it is a bad idea to spend all free time on computers. It is always good to go outside and get some fresh air. Also going out and doing activities with friends or family is good too. And the more time you spend on computers, the more likely it is you will become fat! Thats why america is one of the oberstest @ORGANIZATION1 is because we spend more time playing games than exercising or doing activities. Don't you enjoy the feel of the moist air of a spring mornig? I do. Do you think if you stay up all night playing the computer you will be able to witness it? Of course not and you know it. So take a break from @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @NUM1 and go outside. The fresh air is good for you! So put down the mouse and keyboard and maybe even the head-set and get out and go do something. Who wouldn't ant to go to the fresh or on a snowboarding trip with a friend? I know I definitely would. I love being in the water or @CAPS3 down the @CAPS4 dodging trees! Also hanging out with friends is way matter than being isolated playing @CAPS5.O.@CAPS5 (world of warcraft) for your week with a tower of learning pizza bakers like that guy @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. That isn't good. Because if you stop going out your not going to go out anymore! Then your not going to have all the friends you to and once you realize that your going to be upset and your going friends and family. And who couldn't use a good muscle tone? I know I could. Thats why I started playing less computer games and up the basketball and have been playing a ton more of that. For instance me and my team won the @CAPS6 small division league @CAPS7!!! (I'm # @NUM2) we won because our coach made us wors herd, and we got exercise that made our bodies stronger. Thanks to our coach we got the exercise we needed and because of basketball it focused our minds on something else other than computer games. So please get out and get some fresh air. Go out and enjoy nature with friends and family. And don't forget to exercise here and there its good for you.",8
2238,"Dear Local newspaper, In my opinion there are god and bad effects with technology ussage, but the bad effects i think, are worse. Manly because children and people of all ages aren't getting enough exercise, and enjoying the world. Also, with being on the computer all the time, they aren't talking, or spending time with friends. One of the main problems in our society is people getting stolen, and you could meet someone bad and tell them personal things if you begin to trust them. So as you can see, computers and technology do have some problems. With being on the computer all the time, kids don't get out, and enjoy the freshair. Clearly if you are on your butt all day, everyday, you are gonna get big, or even worse, obese. If the child is young and is on the computer all the time, he could become afraid of being out side, or just never wanting to. If you are staring at a computer screen a lot you eyes get dry, and make you tired, so you will probably just sleep half the day, and then be on the computer. So you obviously need to be outside everyonce in a while. No-one in the world can live a happy life without someone to talk to and thats whats happening to people cause, they are busy on the computer all the time. So clearly if you don't talk to your friends or ever see them you are gonna lose them. If you lose many friends you could become lonely and depressed, and start hiding from everyone. So you will lose all contact with family too, and then start thinking about suicidale, and other bad things, that's always bad. Everything like myspace and facebook is always gnna have bad people on it. If your child starts talking to this person, and gives out personal information he or she could get stolen from you. Who knows what this person is thinking of doing to this child! She or he could get raped, or even murdered! No parent is gonna wanna have that happen to their child. So as you can all see. Computers can be really bad. But, as long as you get out some, hang out with friends, and stay safe you should be alright!",8
2239,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS3 I'm sure you know there I talk about the effect of computers on people. The amount of inquiry about computers is large. I am there to tell you that these claims are inexplicably one hundred percent incorrect. @CAPS3 there are bad claims being made the good claims rise out of the ashes. Did you know that computers cant be good for our society and believing that computers are bad are tearing down society there is nothing wrong with computers. In fact we use it all the time we talk to friends, learn about far away place we @MONTH1 never visit in our lifetime, the computers teach hand-eye cordination to help better type on keyboards, finnaly they offer you the satisfaction of being able to do things on those rainy days that leave you locked in the house with nothing to do. When we are home alone with nobody to talk to hoe well we keep a social life. Well the answer is this socalled ""problem"" that people speak of known @CAPS3 computers. wouldn;t you like the confort of kicking back realxing and talking to your friends on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. You can really get to know people and connect to family members on the other side of the globe if you wanted to. You know most people have moved from a state or country should you really find it fitting to take away the fastes way to communicate without bringing your phone will every month long distance, no! You know i'm one fiftenth mongollian and i've never been to mongollia. I'm als jewish but i've never been to @LOCATION1 either, doie that mean I'll never learn about them? of course I will, I can get all the information I need about them on my computer. I can find out long , even the such @CAPS3 the biggest mountains or @MONTH1 be the smallest of lakes. Obviously the information I can is rare then I could without a computer to aid me and answer my @CAPS3 well it can teach me about hand eye coordination this will make my typing faster and life easier. Finnaly, on the rainy day in the will you go sleep, eat, watch @CAPS4, or just play around. Well you have to you can go yout computer which offers you more than all of those things. @CAPS3 I've said earlier you can talk to friends, play on line long, or just watch videos on @CAPS5, and all this things and more are offered to you. In conclusion Computers are not a ""problem"" or ""menace to society"" but a key component to our everyday lives and without this in our society would'nt function has it does today it was lack our modern technology and we would live very differently. We use computers to talk to friends, to learn about faraway places, teach handeye coordination, and provides something to do or bad . @CAPS3 you can see computers are okay!",10
2240,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that people use computers to benefits society. I totally agree with this statement. I think this because the computer allows people to talk online with others, give the ability to learn about far away places, teach hand-eye coordinations and positive effect on people. Read on and im sure I will support my reasons with my opinion. The computer allows people to talk online with others. I agree with this policy because, if they don't have a house phone or cell phone they can talk to you online instead a paying the phone bill. Talking online is easier than a monthly phone bill. If their was no computer then we would have to pay the phone bill. More and more people should continue talking online a phone does not have a keyboard like the computer does. This is why I believe people should talk online to friends. The computer gives people the ability to learn more about far away places, and people. If the computer was not invented then we would not have to learn more about far away places, and people. The computer gives people facts and other resoures that we need.",6
2241,"Dear @PERSON1, I think that people spend two much time on the computer.

The should at least go on for lyke @NUM1 to @NUM2 mins tops I only go @NUM3 about ten mins I dont lyke the computers. If you go on the internet you can talk to anyone in the world. If you just call your friend there wont be problems. You should always have time for your family you should get fresh air dont be inside all the time if you stay on the computers you can start to gane weight from being in one price at a time. Computers are bad for your brain growth and you need to do other things than staying on the internet.",6
2242,"I do not support advances in technology. I feel that people that use too much technology they won't be as healthy, their social skills will decrease, and more businesses will close. A healthy body is important to every human. But healthiness @MONTH1 be a problem with more technology. If you are on the computer all day, where are you going to find time to excercise? When you eat it needs to be balanced by doing something rather than sitting in a chair. A screen on your computer seems harmless, but really the bright flashes it gives off can really damage your eyes. Being social is a very big part of your life. It's how you make friends and form bonds. Technology, like cell phones, are a disadvantages to a social life. While texting you can't tell if someone is joking, serious, or happy. The texting language used could be a misunderstanding and hurt feelings. It is better to go and talk to the friend in person. Also, if you stay in the house all day, every day, on the computer or playing video games, you might lose some social skills. Then, talking to new people will be harder. Going shopping with your mom might not be too fun, but you have to get food and clothes. If technology grows this activity won't be available. Buying supplies online will be easier and faster. As a result, car companies will go out of business. Our economy isn't doing too good right now, so why do more harm to it? In conclusion, technology will take away our health, social skills, and businesses. Do we want this? No, advances in technology are harmful to the human race and the world.",8
2243,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 we like it or not, our society is transforming into a life revolving around technology. This change is inevitable, and, in my opinion, is a positive. By having computers, we as a world are able to advance and recch our highest potential. Therefore, because computers teach hand-eye coordination supply us with research information and allow is to communicate. I believe that computers are a positive contribution to society. To start I believe computers are a positive contribution to society because they teach hand-eye coordination. By developing the skill, individuals can move on to other activities that involve hand-eye coordination such as tennis. Also, the skill of han-eye coordination can also be used in the workforce and @MONTH1 be essential to mantaining a steady job. Either way it is safe to say that by developing hand-eye coordination by using computers, it can end up being a great skill to have as you proceed through life. Another positive contribution given to society by computers is the ability to have information on nearly everything in a matter of seconds. This is beneficial on aspects of learning such as research projects where the desired information is scorcely found in books. By having a computer for research though, the needed information can be found with the click of a button. The computer can also help when you are planning to make an investment but would like to research it prior. You are able to acess customer reviews on the product, or the best price between multiple stores. Lastly, a culture or group of people can be researched and with a firm understanding, their is a chance that they @MONTH1 to be more resacked int the future. Lastly, computers allow those from all around the globe to communicate easily, quickly, and effectively in many ways. To start, computers can help us alert other nations of approaching natural disasters, or they can do the same for us such as what occur of between click and. With a simple computer, thousands of lives could be spared from injury, (or worse). Computers also allow us to send information back from outer space with the pressing issue of overpopulation predicted in the future it is vital that we are looking for alternative ""homes"" in outer space. Thus, the information we gather and transfer back to earth through computers is essential to our societies well being computers can also allow people to stay in touch with their family and friends. Regardless of their locations, computers allow people to solitify their bond through instant message, emails, or face to face video chats. As I previously stated, our world is beginning to revolve around technology, and we can't bring this trend to a hault. Instead of looking at computers as a negetive, we need to view them as the positive tool that develops hand-eye coordination and assist in research and communication and embrace them to the fullest.",10

How could something with so many negatives benifit mankind? One of the most severe problems with computers and internet use is addiction.

2247,What is your opinion about computers. Mine opinion about computers is yes I do think to much people sprend more time on computers. Some people don'@CAPS1 get there chorces done because they always on the computer then when there parents come home they get on punisment. I think thats why students don'@CAPS1 do there homework because the be playing video games on the computer. Once you get on its like you can'@CAPS1 log off its like watching @CAPS1.V but you on the computer. However people have chorces to do when they come home from school they say well well mine parents an'@CAPS1 home I could do what ever I want to do then when there parents do comes home they wonder why they get on punishment because they didn'@CAPS1 do what there parents said. Its good being a parent to teach there child from right to wrong. Certainly when the teacher ask us for our homework most students say oh I don'@CAPS1 know I didn'@CAPS1 feel like doing my homework and the teacher ask why? because I was either hanging out with my friends or on the computer or playing video games all day. That why students get the grades they get because they not focus on school. It's best to used the computer fo school projects too not just video games. The only good time that its good to go on the computer is when you ask your parents to go on and you did everything that you were suppose to do. Its best to go on lot a on the weekeneds because many people be on thats more of your friends you could talk to. When you get on it's hard to log off because you get amazed by all the things you can look at on the computer. Its like watching @CAPS1.V you be focus more. I want the local newspaper to agree with my prompt because my reasons are good reasons. You don'@CAPS1 do your chorces you get in trouble. Most people don'@CAPS1 do there homework they focus on video games. Ask before you go on the computer and then everything will be fine.,8
2248,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that there is a debate whether the advancement in computer technology is a good or bad thing. Some experts believe that people don't excercise, spend time with their famalies, or enjoy nature due to computers. However, I believe that the advances in computer sciences are very much needed. I believe there are three reasons why we should support advances in computers, the first reason is simple in the buisnesses they always need better technology. The second reason is that computers are slowly replacing a lot of things. The last reason is we need to keep up with the other countries. I believe that the businesses will always need the next new program at application. A perfect example of this would be the @ORGANIZATION3 telecommunications systems this applications helps businesses that are global, talk to their different branches without sending a representative to all the branches around the world. Another key program that is always going to be needed is power point, I'm sure @CAPS2 would quite embarrasing to use @ORGANIZATION2 windows @NUM1 to pitch your ideas to a corporate sponsor, who has had an upgrade for quite some time. I think that computers are also beginning to replace many popular recreational tools of the past for example, look at television you can now go to websites that display your favorite television show sometimes commercial free. I know also that the trend of buying @CAPS3's is slowly starting to decline, with the @DATE1 invention of @ORGANIZATION4's @CAPS4 on @NUM2 player with the ability to hold more than @NUM3 songs! The @CAPS4 surely beat @CAPS3 players, along with the @CAPS4 came @CAPS5 an application where you can buy and dowload songs, movies and games, with prices ranging from @MONEY2 - @MONEY1. My last reason of why the advancement of computers is positive is because the government needs to keep up with the other countries. If the @LOCATION1 were to not have the technology that could comprehend enemy intel, then our counter @ORGANIZATION1 would not make enough important progress to keep our nation safe. Another reason is that without certain robotics many people would have to live with fake arms, and or other body parts. I conclude this letter by saying to consider the major buisnesses who can't afford to send a represenitive, or how you can watch tv programs on the internet for free, and the updates needed to keep a.",11
2249,"I think that kill are on the computer too much and exersizing to lee. When you do this your muscles will tighten, you will get out of shape, nad your @CAPS3 will grow weak. If these things happen you must likly will feel horrible. You will get out of shape because you will not be moving at all. Also you are just setting in room next to a computer. Finally when you do actually do move if will hurt because you have no muscle flex. Just sitting in the room all day you muscles will tighten from not moving at all. Also you will have no exersize for the muscle to get. The muscle will weaken from no muscle flex. ""muscleflex is one on the most important uses of the "" says @ORGANIZATION1. Finally your @CAPS3 will grow weak with no exercise for the body. also no cardio is bad for the cardiovascular . Letting your @CAPS3 growweak is a very bad habbit ad grow into at a young age. Statistics show that @NUM1 of kids in the @LOCATION1 dont have enough exersize. This letters to this paper @LOCATION1 that too much do time is bad because you get out of shape your muscle will tighten and your @CAPS3 will grow weak. Would you want your @CAPS1/@CAPS2's @CAPS3 to weaken?",6
2250,"To the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1: I think that computers have a positive effect on people and it is an advance in technology. The computer is a new technology that can be very useful for education purposes. Computers can also be used to connect with family and friends, and the computer can have useful games that can help us. The computer definitely has positive effects on people. for school and any other educational purposes, the computer can be very useful for @CAPS2. Computers can help @CAPS2 with their homework or projects with a click of a button. They can research about any topic online and use that information if they don't have time to go to the library. The computer also has @ORGANIZATION2, a program that is often used at home, offices, and even in school. With this program, @CAPS2 can type up their paper and just print to have a neat copy that they can turn in. Teachers also think that the computer can be very useful when it comes in education. In a survey, @PERCENT1 of teachers use the @CAPS1 or any other program on the computer to try and learn a lesson. More and more teachers are discovering educational websites and programs that can help @CAPS2 learn a subject. @CAPS2 also take a liking to that subject when they find that they can interact with the subject online. It can make the subject more enjoyable for the @CAPS2 to learn, and for the teachers to teach. Computers will always be on the aide of education. People can also use the computer to interact with friends and family online. Family you don't see for years can be reconnected with you through video chatting or instant messaging. You can also reconnect with people who live far away. Through websites like @CAPS3 and @ORGANIZATION3, people can talk to their friends and family more easily. @PERCENT2 of teenagers would rather talk to their friends through the computer than talking to their friends through the telephone. It is more enjoyable to see your friend while talking to them if you are videochatting. That is what you can use the webcam for. many people have the webcam and they use it for connecting with friends and family. It is a great way to be social and branch out to your peers. You can also use the @CAPS1 to meet new people and learn about others who you have never met before. Computers are a great way to connect with friends and family and be social. Computers can also be very useful for @CAPS4, groups, and committees that are trying to reach out to the other people. As the @ORGANIZATION1, a widely known newspaper I'm sure you have a website that readers can log onto and learn more about your newspaper @CAPS4 use the @CAPS1 to create websites that can inform buyers, partners, or other people who want to find out more about their business. And through the @CAPS1, they can also advertise their business if they wish. It is very useful and can earn you a lot of money by attracting customers to buy your products. Groups like the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 can use the @CAPS1 to inform citizens of what they are trying to get people to support and to acknowledge the awareness of the importance of that group. They can use the @CAPS1 to gather supporters and expand their group. @CAPS4, groups and committees will use the computer to lure in customers and supporters which will earn them much money. The computer can be useful for many different reasons and it will always be advancing our new technology of the day. Whether used for educational purposes, social purposes, or business purposes, the computer has a positive effect on people.",11
2251,"Dear @CAPS1, Are computer a good thing for out society? Is'nt it possible that this is @CAPS5 dangerous people can be. Child pornography, fake people using some one elses name. Also, it's a lack of exersise, obesity is increasing alot in the @ORGANIZATION1 due to this technology. What about the other important things in life like your family, your friends. Wont you eventually lost them forever? First, children communicate on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 but do they really know is it's their friends or a sick man playin a joke. I was reading an article about a @NUM1 year old girl who commited suicide, because aof a boy she met on @CAPS3 left her. Her parents in the end found out this was a hoax from their neighbors to see it she was talking about her to other students. Also the internet is full of child pornography because girls want to send it to their boyfriend yet it gets posted every where or landed in to the wrong hands. In this case it's a serious matter so that a negative benift computers have on us human? Next, @CAPS5 many hours do you think a teenagers are addicted to the computer? Do you think they ever exersise? Each year obesity is increasing tremendously. It's not only junk food we eat but since we never exersise due to lack of good nuitrtion or for always being on the computer. I see people who are always on @CAPS3 who have trouble breathing for walking a bright of stars. That is very upsetting! Another reason, when was the last time you had a heart to heart conversation with your child. Is he/she to busy conversating with their friends. I learned this from experince my mother and I aren't as close as we used to be because I'm alway on the internet. Now that I try to talk to her she has aswell became too adicted. The last time we had a family dinner was most likely a year a go. It's really said to see others family do the same. What about your friends who don not have a @CAPS3 or @CAPS2 you end up using contact with them even though they never did anything wrong. In conclusion, @CAPS9 not saying technology is bad but it has it's negative parts. The technology isn't safe anymore. It has become a dangerous place for us teens or adults. The lack of exersise because you are to addicted to the computer hastly losing touch with your family not spending times with them. What about your friends are you going to abbandon them when they don't deserve it. think about that.",9
2252,"Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON2, @CAPS2 a world over run by people who cannot drive, walk, talk or do simple tasks like that all because of bad hand-eye coordination. Computers improve hand-eye coordination, allow people to learn about far away people and places, and give people the opportunity to interact with others. We should have computers. First, computers improve peoples hand-eye coordination. @PERSON1 a leading brain doctor, says that computers cut rehabilitation rates of people who suffered from stroke and spinal injuries in half. Also, when children were exposed to computers at an early age they learned to read, write, walk, and talk faster than children who were not exposed to them. In addition, those skills lasted throut their lives, allowing them to learn to drive, and eventually get better jobs. The @ORGANIZATION2 was quoted saying, “ @CAPS3 skills should be the #@NUM1 priority for a good education.” @CAPS4, people that use computers can learn about far away people and places without actually being there. In a recent study, children ages @NUM2 scored @PERCENT1 more on average when using computer compared with traditional learning methods. Not all people have access to books and need computers to get a good education. It also improves when they used computer, and it’s a fact that kids got into better coledges with the help of computers. Don’t you want people to be smarter @PERSON2. Last, @CAPS5 people in remote areas only way of communications is through computers. In a poll done by the @ORGANIZATION1 it proved that people in desolat places communicated through computers. In adition, you do not need to be with that person to talk to them so it is a major advantage for long distance relationships. I know that without computers, I would never be able to stay in touch with my best friend that moved to @LOCATION1. Picture a world where there is never any car accidents, your children can walk at the age of @NUM3 months old, and everybody is never tripping over their own feet. Computers improve hand-eye coordination, allow people to learn about things that they normally cant, and create @ORGANIZATION2 path ways for communication. So get out there, @CAPS1 @PERSON2, and tell the world to keep computers.",9
2253,"I think that computers have positve effects on people. My first reason is because it lets you communicate with other people. It helps you do your schoolwork and understand things better. You can also do cool projects and fun stuff. My first reason is because it lets you communicate with other people. If your absent at school and you don't know what the work was you can ask your friends or even your teacher. If you have a friend and he or she moved to another country you can still talk to them with websites like aim or facebook. For example I used to lived in @ORGANIZATION1 and I moved to the @LOCATION1, but I can still talk to my old friends. You can also communicate with your friends if you want to go outside and play soccer or basketball. My second reason is it helps you do your homework and understand things better. If your teacher told you to find the definition for genre and you don't know what it means you can always websites like google or dictionary. And sometime you need the computer to do your homework, my teacher told me to make a blog about a book after I finished it. Sometimes when your watching a show on television and you don't know what something means you can always look it up. Like one time I was watching @CAPS1 and this kid said ""carly you will rue this day"" I looked up rue and understood what he meant. My third reason is because you can do cool projects and fun stuff. When you are bored you can play games. For example on time it was raining so i couldn't go outside and i went to addicting games.com and played puzzle games all day. When my mom was doing a garage sale she told me to make some adds telling people when and where is the garage sale, so I went in the computer and made the paper more interesting by putting pictures of baseballs, soccerballs and other stuff in it. And you can also lean more stuff with a computer, like how to write a perfect essay, but everything doesn't have to be about school, it can also help you in your future like how to design clothes or houses, or even ride an airplane. So parents @MONTH1 think ""my kids don't want to go outside anymore because their too busy in the computer"". But maybe is the parents fail for that encourage them to go outside and join a sport team. But I think computers have positive effects on kids because it lets them communicate with people that are in other countries. It helps you do your schoolwork and understand things better. And you can do cool projects and fun stuff.",9
2254,"Dear local newspaper, I believe and strongly suggest that people should use computers, computers have a good effect on people by giving people the ability to learn online and take college courses, allow people to talk online using social networking sites, and gives you the chance to find the local news if you don't have cable. One reason I think computers have a good effect on people is that you can learn a lot on the computer and even take college courses! Online can go onto a search engine and type in something you want to research. And in seconds whatever you typed in, links will pop-up bringing you to what you want to learn about. You can learn about @LOCATION1 and about their history or you can look up about Online, you can take college courses and get a degree even. You can be relaxing at home and can get college credits! Another reason that computers have a good effect on people is that people can talk online, On a social networking site, @CAPS1 facebook, you can look up old friends from high school and reconnect, @CAPS1 if they live in @LOCATION2 and you live an @STATE1 you can chat online and stuff. Its also great if you want to talk to family that live far away. You can have a webcam and then you can actually see them and talk and they can see you! The last reason is that if you heard about something and didn't really know but you can find out that stuff online. Online you can look up local or worldwide news online. If you go on the computer and type in your newspaper and they have a website you can read all about whats happening in your town. So I believe and strongly suggest that people should use computers and that they have a good effect on people. So if you want college credits or learn about places you don't know get a computer and it will have a good effect on you, also.",8
2255,"Dear Local Newspaper, More and more people use computers, but not everyone carees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I strongly disagree. Some people are concerned that people spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends. Please continue to discover my disagreeing opinions. @PERSON1, professional singer @LOCATION1 ""Spending too much time on the computers is not all that great for you. Why? Well, because computers take more time, and less time exercising and staying healthy. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids in the @LOCATION1 get obese from computer attention. You wouldn't want green eyes, and regular size weight gaining more and? I bet you wouldn't want that. Has it ever occured to you, how beautiful nature can be? Imagine nobody outside enjoying the beautiful. Seeing every single kid, even adults. Imagine that! wouldn't you love to have a relaxing day of nature having those laughing having a time outdoors and your child getting exercise at the same time! Not only that but having computers is a waste of time! @PERCENT1 of families across the nation have family issues only because of computers! I remember one time when my brother got this new computer game called @CAPS1.O.@CAPS1 (@CAPS2 of @CAPS3) it was a popular computer game. My mom told him to turn it off and do some exercise, they started bicker alot. Things like this can ruin relationship and interaction with your family members. As you can see, computers can cause a bunch of horrible things like the ones I have mentioned in this essay. Wouldn't you want a healthy life for your child? If so, computers do the opposite. If you had to write an essay about computers, would you agree or disagree?",9
2256,"What effect do you believe computers have? My opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe this because, first our government runs on computers. Next, we can search the web when ever we need to find new about stuff. Finally, kids can study and do projects online. To begin, I think computers have a positive effect on people because our whole goverment runs on them. Without computers our state could be a disaster! Our government uses them to keep tracks of their files. They use computers to keep important data. Whether its for money, meetings or anything else. We can always count on computers to keep us on tract and organized. Next, computers can help us a lot in this world. Another reason why they are a positive thing is because we can always go online to see important news we need to know. Most people are way to busy to watch t.v., others just watch the news but when you turn on the t.v. Its too late! Well the first thought that comes to peoples minds is the computer. Many parents use them to check for delays on snowy days or other news that @MONTH1 concern them. I know this because it a personal experience! Lastly, computers are a good thing because kids can do projects, study or homework. Without computers kids wouldn't be so advance as they are now. In the internet kids can learn by playing educational games. They can use the computer to find biographies of a person's life far a project or homework. Not only kids can use. It, but also @CAPS1. If a parent wants to finish school they could take online classes. Most people think computers have negative effects on people but there way more positive effect because it more educational and helpful than people think. In conclusion, I think computers are a positve effect on people because of the reasons I listed before. First, our goverment runs on computers. Next, we search the web to find important news. Lastly, kids can use it for educational purposes. For the most part I think computers are very important in this world. Now the question is. Do you think computers are a negative or positive effect on people?",9
2257,"What do you think about computers? Computers are the name of a new age and everyone is all about the online activities that allow you to have an updated mind. The computer is twice as fast than a book, it tells you. X ammount of facts on what your searching on. The computer isn't just for research, there is other ways to use it like online chatting, gaming, and gaves you the option to meet new people and make new friends. Computers can be used for just about anything! To help your vocabulary to communitcating and making your learning abilities better. The computer is the center of our universe. The computer is twice as fast than the average book. In books, you have a whole five extra steps to finding what you want. Take looking in an dictionary for example. The index tells you what page, it is what your trying to find item. Sometimes you struggle to find it, once you have found it, it @MONTH1 not be what your looking for. Or, you @MONTH1 not understand. The computer is a one step process, and ahead of the game. It immedietly takes you to your designated question. If one response isn't the right one, then theres @NUM1 more that sure enough, is what your trying fo find, and the more specific you get an your search, the & faster your answer will find you! Books @MONTH1 have been in the @LOCATION1 ages, and the information isn't always up to date. Computers have the power to update and make better explanations, or web pages on your finding. Books are printed once and millions of copies are made, all the information stays the same. In the world we live in now, new stories and news comes up every minute of our life. You would never find a out of the blue in a news update that happened yesterday. Computers are million of people every day are informed by the internet in a matter of seconds. This is just the various are better than the book. Computers have the power to enhance your abilities, your vocabulary and communication skills, just like a book would. But yet again the computer is faster, updated and everyone is on it. As much as books help with learning new words or communication skills, the computer can do the same thing but explain twice as good and there are a lot of different ways to learn what your trying to find than in a book. The computer also allows you to meet other people. It gives you the chance to make a new friend or maybe start a new life. The computer isn't just for learning, and this is why everyone loves it. Now I understanding there are people out there who hack these computers and stalk you, but there's also the option to upload @CAPS1-virus servers to block them from getting at you! If youre smart enough, bad things wont happen to you! What do you think about computers? The average person is in love with this wonderful creation. Computers are the center of our universe and the name to a new age. The computer is like god! Always there for you, it never let's you down and is always a good thing to have. This is why I think computers are better than the average book.",10
2258,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, I have heard talk going around about computers. People are saying they are bad because they take away @CAPS1 much of our lives. I say that isn't true. We do spend a lot of time on computers but that doesn't necacerally mean we are wasting our time. Computers provide us with infinente knoledge. They allow us to talk to our friends and family across the world, and they have allowed human society to take massive leaps in everyday things. First, they provide infinete amounts of knowlegde. Today, you can find just about any thing you want on a computer. An expieriment was conducted last year by a @ORGANIZATION1 proffesor, who @ORGANIZATION1 people and society. Professor @PERSON1 took a pole to see what people did when faced with difficult, everyday questions. He went house to house and risked average people. Over <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of them went straight to their computers or laptops to look it up. Another <@PERCENT1@NUM2> took out thier cell phones, went on the internet and looked it up. The last @PERCENT1 said ""I don't know"" and walked away. This adds up to a total of <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of people who use their computers or internet. Is that a large number of people or what? This reminds me about a good friend of mine from a while ago. He got onto the gameshow ""@CAPS1 you wanna be a @CAPS2?"" and was doing pretty well. We went to his @ORGANIZATION3 house to watch it with her. She is a very intelegent woman, but doesn't know every thing. @CAPS4 friend ended up winning @MONEY1 because of a computer. He get stuck on a question and used phone a friend. When he did this, the phone in his @ORGANIZATION3 house started ringing. I hadn't even celized it but she was already up and at the computer  it up. She found it in less than @NUM4 seconds, gave him the answer, and won him @MONEY2. What would've happened if she didn't have that computer? They would've gotten nothing. You see, publishing if it weren't for that computer, even for that one website, he would have sot. This website is called, ""@CAPS3"". @CAPS3 is the #@NUM5 most used website. I provides countless websites and information for just about anything. Isn't that helpful? @CAPS4 second reason involves family and friends. Websites susch as yahoo and facebook, allow you to instant messages from across the world. Others like @ORGANIZATION4 allow you to web chat with someone, you can see them on the computer monitor and hear them too. For example, @CAPS4 mon works for a company called ganz. She is constatnly traveling places. Even now, as im writing this, she is on a plane flying to @LOCATION6, @LOCATION1. She also goes to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3,  places in @LOCATION4, and to @LOCATION5 as well. Most of these trips last only a week or @CAPS1, except for @LOCATION5. She goes to @LOCATION5 @NUM6 out of @NUM7 months every year. She misses @DATE2, and @DATE1. @DATE1 is the worst for me. Not only does she miss halloween, but she misses @CAPS4 birthday. I am @NUM8 right now and the last time @CAPS4 mother was home for @CAPS4 birthday was when I was @NUM9. I can't take it but on @CAPS4 birthday she sets aside two times to talk to me on @ORGANIZATION4. @ORGANIZATION2, if you take away computers you take away the only chance for me to talk to @CAPS4 mother for weeks at a time. @CAPS4 last reason is about computers and the advances they help us make.",10
2259,"Dear local newspaper, Have you ever been playing a game to the point where you want to hurt other people? Or even to the point your family thinks your out of the country? Many people depend on the computer too much either for entertainment or to get their feelings out. But the more you spend on the computer the more you are forgeting about your family and that you need to stay calm around other people. Not only to you become more independent and agressive and the lack of exercising adds weight to your body. When people use the computer it is because they have nothing to do. So instead going for a walk they just sit there talking or playing with other people online. This makes the person more agressive towards other people. Also this time of time with your mother or father. This time spend with your family could help you with self extreme, social skills, and politeness. People all around the world are fat because of poor diet and no exercising. When you are on the computer this makes you want food fast. Most people would eat a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for a fast meal which adds more than enough calories to that persons diet. On the computer you dont know who would want to talk to some miles and miles away. That person could be a who out of prison. You dont know if they know who you are and where you live. So if they you, you dont know what to do call the police. Also many people can hack your computer and steal your personal files and pictures. This can show the person were you live or even what your doing on the computer.

The computer is definitly an excellent way to be informed about lots. Secondly, the internet is a great way for socializing. If you could not talk to relitives in another country on a telephone, you could chat with them lots of teenagers that are trying to make plans go on the internet to chat with close friends. Isually go on facebook when I need to talk with someone that dosn't hve a cell phone either. It is so easy. Lastly, the computer is an amazing way to do on projects for or even work.

2261,"I believe that computers do come in many at times but people should spend less time on them for many reasons such as being fit and healthy being secure and safe and exploring the beautiful world we live in. The reason why I believe that computers have a negative affect an being fit and healthy is because one of my mathers friends pretty much spent three years wasting her time on the internet and gained over @NUM1 pounds. Another reason is because when your on the computer, you soon to get hungry of course so what do you do., snack on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The reason why I beleive the internet isn't always safe is because I went an a chatroom called ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" and when I logged in I @CAPS6 in the main chat that people were hooking up and trying to find where one and another live, but thats not even the worst part, one of @MONTH1 friends went on a chatroom and my friend talked to this guy who was @NUM2 and she was @NUM3, anyways she talked to him about every other day far about a year and she finally decided to trust him and give him some of her private information such as where she lives and what not. He found out pretty much everything about her and the next time they talked he called her inapropiate names and told her he was going to kill her, plus, he doesn't live very far, he lives in @LOCATION1. Lastbut not least the reason why it's important to explore the outdoors is because nobody wants a lonely life and if you sit down at the computer all day it's bound to happen. Also you need to explore this world because you only have one life and your wasting it on flash games, @CAPS7, @CAPS8 or some other websites. Alright you guys, you could go on the computer just not for long, that keyboard and monitor are on addiction!

2262,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I had to support on people using ccmputers to people going out and getting the exercise. It would be people getting the exercise in this prompt im going to be explaning why I agree on people getting out instead of people going on the computer. One is that computers are making the postal services go bankrupt more and more people are getting obese and lastly kids are going on the wrong websites and meeting up with people. More and more people are getting computers and using them daily to pay bills, shop online, ect and this is making the postal services go bankrupt. The postal services arnt getting any mail to sent out so there not getting payed. Also when you buy things online it goes to fedex or ups so the postal sevices dosnt get any mail or packages to send or it. I think people are getting to lazy and doing everything on computers and thats not good for buisneses. More and more family are getting obese. Computers are ruinning and messing up familys lives without them noticing. Computers are throwing off a steady exercise plan for the family like going for a walk going to the park and many other things. Familys nutrition is getting ruined and messed up lik instead of having breakfast lunch and dinner they grab a hag of chips and fast off that. Teenagers are getting hurt, raped, and sexually nelested. I think some teenagers boy or girl dont no how powerful the internet is. When a teenager gets a message and they dont no who it is they look at the picture to see @CAPS3 its a cute girl or a cute boy they start talking to them. What some teenagers dont no is that they can put a fake picture on there facebook or myspace and tell them to met up at some location so that they can kidnap you and rape and kill you.

It gets me aggrevated when I see little kids overfat because stil they do is sit around and use a @CAPS3. I think parents shouldnt let their childs use a @CAPS3 a whole day.

Just @CAPS6 a schol does. or any other business does. and that why I think people should atless exercise @NUM1 days a week, so that their bodies will stay healthy and strong.",7

First I will provide facts on how you need to hang out with you friend instead of being on the computer because a computer does not tell anything about your friend. Also you don't see your friend. You can't tell your friend about your own problems because you can get hacked. Second you need exersize because your body need to be healthy. You could also suffer health problems if you are always on the computer like develope bad eyesite or become obese and can't workout. Third is that your pet needs attion to you just can't buy one and then leave it alone for the rest of his life. Your pet need as much loveing as much time you spend on your computer. If you do not spend as much time with your pet as you do with your computer then the pet will abanden you.,6
2265,"Dear newspaper, I think that computers do benefit the society. They are very educational. Its another way to communicate with people and make new friends. They also help with exercising and enjoying nature. Computers benefit society in different many ways. To start, computers are educational. There are websites you can go to to look up history or how to do a science experiment. Also, if your mom or dad is at work and can't take you to a tutor there is online tutoring for all ages. Not to mention it teaches you hand and eye coordination. It also helps you learn about the world around you faster for instance, if a building were to fall or something it would be online almost right after it happened. These are reasons why computers are educational. Also, computers are another way to communicate with people and make new friends. For example, e-mail, if you're trying to reach someone and they'renot anwsering their phone or their text messages or their pager e-mail is another and resource. As soon as you send it, it's there, you don't need bars or signals if you've got internet you can send an e-mail to anyone in less than @NUM1 minutes! If you have a website, you can post things on your website, that helps you communicate with anyone who sees that website. Speaking of websites, there are websites like ""facebook"" where you can make new friends and meet new people. Therefore computers are good communication for people everywhere. Computers help you with activities and enjoying nature. For instance, if you want to go on a hike you can look & what type on or . This helps you stay safe on a hike or if you're camping if you're looking for a gym so you can exercise a computer is a great resource for that as well. Or if you're looking for directions to a certain park or a certain soccer feild a computer can most defenitely help you with that this way you're not late for a soccer game or meeting your friend for a pic-nic in the park. A computer is a big help when it comes to nature, exercising or doing fun activities. In conclusion, computers are a great benefit to society. They are very educational. They're another way to communicate and make friends. Plus they help you enjoy nature and exercise saftely and more effecient. These are big effects that computers have on people.",9
2266,"Dear Local Newspaper. I am writing you this letter to inform you of reasons that computers have a positive effect on people. From kids in school using them to collage students, people use them everyday; for work to just learning in everyday life computers are giving off a positive effect on people. When you pick up your kinder gardener or @NUM1 grader from school you ask them what did you do/learn today. and on most days @NUM2 out of @NUM3 kids say the did something relating to a computer. Some of them say they played a game about adding or subtracting or maybe they are starting to learn how to type. Your @NUM4 and @NUM5 graders said they are typing an essay about @NUM6 or the @CAPS1 on notes they took off of google. But, the big fact is that kids in elementary school all the way to middle school are learning how to use the computer. When they reach high school they have the option to take a class on how to use the computer all the time. Today when you are looking for a job, companies/business usually look for computers background because most jobs require some sort of a computer. If you are a bank teller you use the computer to look up people who need to pay bills or are withdrawing/depositing money into their account. Even a construction worker uses a computer to order supplies or contact a worker. The truth is today @NUM7 out of @NUM8 families use a computer daily. Even when you call @NUM9 they use a computer to find on a map where the accident/emergency is to get there faster. When a mother is at home while the kids are at school and the husband is at work she is usually on the computer. Checking the news, e-mailing her buff's, or her husband at work. Maybe she searching to find the perfect shelter to adopt a dog at in @LOCATION2. When her @NUM10 year old daughter gets home she @CAPS2's her boyfriend on vacation in @LOCATION3. Then she searches on her report about an indian tribe in the @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1. Their wide family uses the computer daily. So, could you please take this letter into consideration. All ages use the computer for school & work so they would see on your webpage if you respond to my letter. Thank you for reading about how everyone uses computers, for school, jobs, and everyday life!!! Thank you",9
2267,"Dear Local @CAPS1, Computers is a big divice used to look up different things. You can look up animals, cars, diffrent appliences. A computer gives you anything that you can't find in the stores but most of the time you order and the supplies what your looking for get, sent to you. Also if you don't have a @CAPS2 and you want to see the @CAPS1 your computer gives you a lot of information. Some of the new computers gives you a lot of information. Some of the new computers is a lot of money like , @NUM1, @MONEY1. The things you can do without going on the computer every five minutes. Computers can cause blindness, brain damage, head akes, if your at work on the computer at the hospital checking patcients in or playing games. the lighting on the computer, the words makes your brain or eyes go blury or constintly looking. Also you can catch cramps in your hands by clicking.",6
2268,"My standing postion on this cause is that computers are good for are technolgy today but if you think that your son or daughter is using today then you can put and block on how long they are on, also it can get comunacation from all arouind the world, and it has the speed of light so you can research stuff and do everythin gyou need to do faster. My first reason is that you can put a block on how long you or your children are on the computer. So if you are one of those pepiole who think that your son or daughter is on the computer to long then you can just put a block on it so they are not on it for more then you want them to be. Also if you think they are on sites they shouldt be then you can put a filter on the intrernet so they cant go on certain things. Also if they are on to long then you can just tell them they cant go on the computer for the rest of the night or sometning like that it is not there fault that pepole lose track of time and what if it is something that needs to be done by tonight and it is a really long thing they have to do or it is for there jobs. Also another one of my reason why computers are more helpful then not is they can let you talk to pepole from all around the world. One is they have chatting sites where you can blog and find new pepole to meet althought there are pepole who do make stuff for the rong purposes nowadays they have moniutours that matchi this things and do reasearch about them once they make a account so if they have done something then they will be closely watched by addminostratiors. Also what if you know someone who moved away and you still want to talk to them you can because of your computer and pepole always say use the phone what if you dont like to talk on the phone or you do like to talk on the phone but at your house you dont get cellphone service there and you cant talk to them because it is staticy so you can use your computer or laptop to chat with them over the web. Or maybe you want to talk to your cousins that moved away and you liked to talk to them a lot but you cant anymore. That is my seconde reason why computers are a good thing. My third reason is that you can search stuff a lot faster threew the computer then you can go threw a book cause a book you have to look for the right book then you have to find a good section of it but on the internet you can just go on a search enginge and you can search right what you need and most of the sites have a description of the site ritght under the web addres so you can see if it what you are looking for. Also what if you ned to have a job paper in tomrrow and you just got it and needs to be about something you dont know about at all you can ask someone over the web to help you and tell you what it is about so you can get it done and keep your job. Maybe in school you need to do a paper for a class and it is a new topic that you have never heard of and you need help witht eht work there are some sites that ave homework help on the wep that you can ask aosmone a question adnt ehy can help you answer it in a short answer or a long one if you need it and they will responde to you either in a little while or right away amnd it is ussaualy right away or in a couple minutes so they can help somone else. Also if you dont belive your computer is runing fast anymore you can just go onto some sites that will inhance your computer speed for no money at all unlike those downloading disk that take forever it is a statistic that for every one disk that someone buy there are @NUM1 pepole who use they intrernet to inhance the speed of your computer so it is 1/@NUM1 of the people who use the internet to inance your internet in minutes instead of those long periods to download instal on the computer that slow disk. That is my third reason why I hitnk that computers are a lot more helpfull then they are'nt.",12
2269,"@CAPS3 I think about Computers in Society is that, it has great positive effects on People. People can learn things about things in and out of this world. And allows to talk to other people when they need to. Computers could be the best thing that ever happened to us. One @CAPS1 why Computers can be good because its technology can teach people that want to learn about the @CAPS2. Or More, they want to learn about space and planets. Or Learn @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of species are out there. And learn new places for visiting. Another good @CAPS1 is @CAPS5 with other people. Can be d best @CAPS6 you want to talk to.

There are @CAPS11 good @CAPS12 you can @CAPS14 on the @ORGANIZATION2. Like I stated above Computers can be used to learn things in life. Can be used to chat with @CAPS6 and other people.

2270,"Dear local @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I feel that computers do benifit our society now I know you @MONTH1 not feel or share the same opinion as I do but I want to show and explain to you how computers have a good effect on the people of our society. Computers help people find jobs and even find better prices on thing that you would find in a store. Computers also help shy people who won't as socialy active as others have someone to talk to. And lastly computers teach you a lot about things you never even liner about. Computers are a really good way to find jobs. The reason I say this is I remember when my dad didn't have a job for a while and didn't have any luck with the local stores. So one day hes on the computer any happen to stubble upon this really helping website called craigslist.com when he saw how many jobs there were he was a stonished. The next day he went and applied for the job and ended up getting it. Another reason why I say computers benifit our society is online dating. For alot of people it is hard for them to find that special someone. Who know they @MONTH1 be lacking in self confidence of what ever else computers are a good way to look people up they can chat in online chat rooms or even @CAPS3 they want use a web cam. Lastly computers teach you a lot about thing you would never even knew existed for example I remember when I was looking at this animal, and insects site and found out that the daddy long legs is the most deadly spider but they cant bite people only small animals that just amazed me because I hould have never thought that. In conclusion I hope you get why computers benifits our society they can help you @CAPS3 you have problems finding a job. They can also help you @CAPS3 your of lacking in self confidence but still have a companion and lastly they can teach you about thing you never knew about so please see why I believe computers better and benifits our society.",8
2271,"Having a computer can cause you to go on everyday. But computers are very helpful @CAPS2 people can @CAPS1 work on them. People who have computers usually @CAPS1 work on them for their job or use them to keep in touch with family and friends. They can use them to look things up like look up times for a fight they can check the weather easily. The people that spend most of their time on their computer have been missing out on whats going on in the real world and they are probably not used to runing and get tired easily and they need to exercise and go outside more to get fresh air. Sometimes you have to put away the computer and go @CAPS1 something thats not virtual and have fun.

2273,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a positive effect of people. I think this because it can help relieve stress socialize, and help eye-cordination. The first reason I think computers have a positive effect on computers is then can help relieve stress. For example after a long day of work at a stressful place you wan't to go home and go on the computer. You can then play games which will relax your mind. The second reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people is that they help socialize. For example say I @NUM1 grade you met someone really special and then you had to move. Well on the internet there are social sites to meet friends you haven't seen in a while. The last reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people is that they can your hand-eye cordination skills. This skill can be very useful later in life with many jobs & tasks. Computers help for example by letting you play games that you need to follow and move past. I hope that the writers of this local newspaper use my letter in an article because it has good points that show computers do have a positive effect on people.",7
2274,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern: @CAPS1 you enjoy going on the computer? I believe that being on the computer is very useful. First, being on the computer helps teach people hand-eye coordination. Second, the people can learn about different places and people. Lastly, anyone on the computer can talk to friends and family. Please read on to learn more. First and for most, being on the computer helps teach the people learn hand-eye coordination. By typing you need to know where your hands need to go so you well with the computer. This helps in life because if your trying to go and @CAPS1 a sport you need to knw wher your hands and/or feet have to go. Also, when your typing you should know where the keys are. This helps you because when your typing something for your boss or teacher it won't take forever to type it out. Next, you can learn about other places and people. If you were going on a trip you @MONTH1 a little bit about that place. Then you find places you want to visit country. Also, you can one person become famous. You couls use this info to write a work article. Further more talk to your friends and family. Sometimes people can't find specific phone numbers in the phonebook. Instead they could go on facebook, myspace, ect. And talk to them on the website that them to chat. Finally, some people can't hear so they can't talk on the phone. Instead they would be able to send emails back and forth. Can't you see the computer is useful? I teaches us hand-eye coordination. We can learn more about different places and people. Finally, we can keep in contact with friends and family. So it's now or never, should agree or disagree that computers are beneficial?",8
2275,"Computers today have taken a toll on society. Using technology advancement has changed the world. Two out of four people are using a computer more then a hour a day. Which seems to be changing how we are evolving @CAPS1 a being. Some people are obsessed others just forget about nessary needs the body has. Computers should be taken down a knoch until we realize how to live with them without computers becomming our life. Young children, teens, and adults have seen effects of technology on love ones or just close friends. The century we are living in has become a new aera for technology advances. We have gotten hooked on not needing to think or use our brains, why would we when we have everything, all the answers two clicks away on google. Individuals don't see theirselves becomming obsessed, always wanting to be chating away on facebook or serching away for answers to homework. @NUM1 years ago they didnt have a easy way to get answers in life or communakate. people that become obsessed cant picture their life without computer games or facebook seights. Men and women turned out fine without computers. They worked hard and become full of knowledge that wasnt just given to them. Computure addiction has gone to such @CAPS1 high level that people forget about nessarities, like @CAPS2 and eating right. Being on twenty four seven notifies the mind to only think about what you want, and thats searching your life away. Computers dont move so the ocupier or the chair wont either you miss out on playing with your dog or jogging on the beach. Spending more and more time on the internet means less time outside and burning caliories that you consume until typing away @CAPS1 you become bigger and bigger the less you care about @CAPS2 and eating the correct way. Computers and deffinetly linked too obisity problems in the @LOCATION1. We all need a reality check on what our main priorities are. The effects of computers are going to demolish the @LOCATION1. Human beings are too dependent on what they believe computers can do for them. people cant have a normal conversation without bringing up computers or sieghts they have visited before. Dont you find it rude when your trying to talk to a friend and they are typing away at their phone that just got internet? I surely do. You cant ask somebody a question without a hold on... What did you just say. Internet is comming everywhere phones portiable laptops. We forget how to act when we talk because of computure slang and just being on. We even have on line dating services that bring people together because they dont meet people, because their on computers all day. We should change how we are evoling before its too late and people don't know how to talk to each other without using slang or having sunglasses with internet screens in side them. Changing our obsession could bring teen and child school grades up, more athlets in the world to compeat in the olimpic and chances for every being to become a better person.

2276,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I belive that computers are a help to our society and give us the upper hand on other countries, @CAPS4 example most countries around the world do not have a computer in eviry home our countrie has @NUM1 to @NUM2. Our countrie has a computer in @PERCENT1 of our homes that means we have a well educated populace, computers give insight to far away places that makes people want to travle and that can help our economy. When a middle aged man is on the computer bored, and sees a place like @CAPS5 he plans a trip with a computer, buys tickets with a computer, and then books a hotel with a computer. Those things cost money and the spending boost our economy. We do infact have a problem with obesety in our country but computers can help fix that. The computer game wil is montion inter active making the person dance, jump, play base ball, run a marathon, and many other sports you could also advertise gym memberships on the internet causing people to work out and lose weight.

2277,"Dear @CAPS1 newpaper, @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS2 hve a computer in their houshold. What would it be like if all of them are as it and not with the outside world? Well, studys show that this is one of the main reasons that @CAPS3 are becoming unhealthy. People are concerned that we are spending to much time on the computer and less tme exercise, enjoying with family and friends. Computers are not needed and serve as a tords as @CAPS2. Less time exercising is a problem even without computers. There are so @MONTH1 now adays that a computer is just maky it worse. Likemore, this is a reason why @CAPS2 are going weight. Studies show that @CAPS6 are not exercising becuse @NUM1 mainly web games and computers. Therefore, Computers are something the we can what. Nature is an of the beautis of the world and computers are that away from us. For example: People think that the computer gives them information about nature but really they not for their selves. Make us somethg that not be seen in prison not an a computer. Family and friends is another problem with computers. People get addicted to and as a result, my dad interest with . Also, computers hav eveythg from games to e-mail that could be the for.

2278,"Computers have evolved so much in the past twenty years. However, is that a good thing for the average @CAPS1? People using computers twenty four seven is a problem. They: rather use a computer then go outside they start relaying on them too much and people can easly get addicted. This can really have a affect on society when the computer goes sour. In @LOCATION1, the @DATE1 is such a great time. People start going outside more, the weather warms up which means that it is a great time to go outside. However, if people go on the computer constantly, now do you expect for them to be able to enjoy this great @DATE1 weather. The computer caused problems since when someone is about to go outside the computer drogs them in wanting them to use it more. That is when the inosent is droged by the computer, and when they rather use it then go outside. Now a days, so many things can be done on the computer just to avoid the store, as the bills. Computers are used to buy items at stores, pay bills, or even to get those tax refunes in. However, don't you believe that people are relaying on computer too much? How would the owner react if one day they were on the computer and it were to shut down. The person would loose it and not know what to do. They would now know how to take care of the problem. A lot of people use computers no only because they have to, but also for there enjoyment. There enjoyment however, can lead to on addiction which means never leaving the computer. An example is when a student comes home from school and decides to on the computer. Before you know it, the time has gone by and it is nightime with the student sill playing on the computer with homework to be completed. We @MONTH1 take advantage of computers sometimes, however they can cause problems. People would rather use them more they can have people relay on them more, and also people become addicted. These are the affects computers have on people.",8
2279,"Dear Local @CAPS1, I think that computers do not benefits society. I think people be exercising more. They should also try interacting more with their family and friends, then with their computer. They could also be enjoying nature or helping their environment. So there are a lot of things you could be doing then playing on your computer. My first reason why i think computers do not benefit society is because people spend all their time on the computer that they do get out of the house and exercise. People have more fan on the computer that all they do is sit and eat. They don't do anything else. Then they do usally get unhealthy and gain weight. However, when they exercise they can get healthy. There are a lot of stuff you can do at the gym to get fit. For example, swimming or running. Sometimes in the gym when you do stuff like swimming or running they will have a tv in there. So you could watch tv or listen to your favorite music instead of being a lazy bum and playing on the computer all day long. If you dont like working out alone then you could bring your friend. You guys could play in the pool or play inside tennis. Or if you don't wanna go the gym just go out for a walk. Or go out jogging. There are a bunch of ways to get healthy and have fun, so your not on the computer all day long. Who knows you might just have more fun. So thats why i think exercising is better for you then playing on the computer all day long. My second reason is people could be interacting more with their family and friends then their computer. Somepeople spend so much time on the computer they forget whats going on in real life. For example, what their kids grades are. They could stop playing on the computer and go to the park with their family and friends. Just spending time with eachother would help their relationship with their family. They could learn alot about them. So just spending with you family and friends would be better then they computer. My third reason is instead of being on the computer they could start enjoying natore or help their environment. The environment could use all the help they could get. Animals are dieing because of us. We should stop cutting down their homes. We should rebuild them so stop going on the computers and actually try to help the environment? You could get your friends and family to help you. It would be great bonding but mostly good for the environment. Or you could go for a nice walk in the park and listen to the birds. Eiether way is good for you. So you should just try it. So those are my reasons why people should spend less time on the computers. You could be having more fun exercising. Or maybe you might have more fun interacting with family and friends. You could also try enjoying and repearing nature. There are a bunch of things you could be doing instead of being on the computer.",10
2280,"Dear news editor, @CAPS1 you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 spend at least @NUM1 hours a day on there computer. I belive that computers are taking to much time in our daily lifes when we can be out doing sports, studing for school, or even spending time with our families. Sports are very important to everyone but not everybody do sports, thats what computers are doing. Computers make it hard for some people to go outside and get some fresh air. In the university of @CAPS3 they @CAPS1 a test conducting teenagers and how they spend there day. Its a fact that @PERCENT2 of students would rather go on the computer and chat with there friends instead of going outside a play a sport. This is very hard for teenagers to get out of something they really enjoy doing but sports also make you very fit and healthy. In one day of going outside you burn more calories then sitting at your computer going on facebook or twitter. Lastly sports get you united with other friends, peopld who play more sports usually tend to be more popular then a person that goes online all day. Sports are important for many different reasons like time wise, healthiness and friends but also the computer takes away your study time. Studing for school is very important when you are in your teenager years, school is the thing that gets you a job when your older, or lets you be whatever you want to be when you grow up. In the univirsity of @CAPS4 they conducted an expiriment that going on the computer for more then @NUM1 hours will decrease your grade average by @PERCENT3. Studing is what gets you through highschool then collage. Also when you are on the computer for so long you tend to forget the asignments that you were asighned for schoo. After all that you wont know what your learning about and fail most of your tests. Lastly, when your all done with highschool and you look at your grades and say ""wow, how @CAPS1 i get this"" You will know that all your computer chatting and playing computer games @CAPS1 this to you. What collage would want an @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7 students in there univirsity. I wouldn't, studing is very important but one of the most important things in life is your family and spending time with them. Families are the things that unite kids to there parent, causing to there uncles. It makes the whole world happy, you dont want to get ride of that just because you want to go online and chat with your friends. Some kids get seperated from there families and never get to see them again and they would give anything to have there parents in there arms. And there are the people who have parents but don't appericate what they do for them. Do you want to turn out like those people just because of a computer? Computers take the ability of people to do what they want to because of there adicting games and online chats, but there are better things to do like sports, studing or spending time with your family. You can make a change.",10
2281,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2, I am very concerned about the effects which computers have on society. Computers have been very useful to us since the day it was invented. They have provided accurate and useful information throughout our daily lives. Computers helps us to view things we never knew existed. They help us to learn about cultures and different places, but just as computers serve a good use, they can also be a burden. Computers prevent people from socializing face to face. They prevent peole from getting their work done. Computers also cause an addiction to small children. These reasons account for the problem, that computers have a negative effect on a majority of people. Computers have a negative effect on a majority of people because it prevents them from socializing face to face. Teenagers especially tend to use the computer more than a cell phone or talking to someone face to face. This is because, on the phone they have a limit for how long they can talk or how many people they can talk to. Talking on the phone all night also raises their phone bill so they get in trouble with their parents. So they use the computer which they can use to talk to more than one person, they dont have a limit and they can stay up all night which is not good for their health. So it reinforces my statement saying computer have a negative affect on a majority of people. Computers have a negative affect on a majority of people because it prevents them from getting their work done. Some adults feel as if they do not have to go to the office to work. They can do the work at home on the computer. So eventually they get fired. Teenagers are busy on the computers talking or playing games, that they do not get their work done. The work is not done so they fail school. When they are older they donot have a good job because instead of doing their work, the spent their time on the computer. Computers are useful but they have a negative affect on a majority of people. Computer have a negative affect on a majority of people because it causes addiction. Many people do not pay attention at school because they were thinking about an awsome game they played or the conversation they had. Computers mostly cause an addiction to small children. Children easily get addicted because, while their brain is in a growing process, it implants the idea of going on the computer to play games on a daily basis. They get too use to using the computer that they do not know when to stop. So computers have a negative affect on a majority of people. In conclusion many adults should really think about the examples I have stated, especially parent. Children have to think about the future instead of wasting life on a computer. I am not saying children should not use computers, I am just saying there should be a limit. Don't you agree?",10

I would much rather use a phone to talk but since everyone always uses the internet and don't bother with a phone it seems to make more sence. Comuters are also very helpful for businesses because they store all their messages about private work and things that need to be worked on like graphs and other important business like problems. Using e-mail is a good way to get news and other fun games and youtube videos. A lot of people pay taxes online now and if you take internet acess away they lose a lot of important information. They might pay their taxes late because of that and if people are used to paying taxes online and all of a sudden they can't and they start doing it with physical paper in front of them, who knows they @MONTH1 have trouble and get very confused. I used the internet for e-mail, @CAPS3, occasionally games, and study @LOCATION1. I think study @LOCATION1 is important for becoming better at certain subjects or lessons. I had to do every study @LOCATION1 in the math section and I did not like it at all doing twenty four tests, but it helped me out with my grade and I'm glad I did it. Also for @ORGANIZATION1 if students have a project clue that involves colorful pictures a computer and colored printer would be very helpful. Also if students have an essay due typing it on microsoft word is a good way for it to be kneet and easily able to read. These were just a few resonds of why computers are good to have and how you can benefit from them.",8
2283,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 is technology all aroud people every day, wether its a work, home, or out on your phones. About @PERCENT1 of people use computers daily. I believe this could have good, and bad effects on people, but mostly good. Effects, education and money run into each other on this subject and computers in my opinion are great! Moreover, I will begin with @CAPS2 effects. For example, my some really great things could happen on the computer with you and your friends while your on an online website, like facebook. People have the opportunity to meet people from all around the world, the only bad part is you have to absolutly know the person. Most of the time it will be one of your friends. On computers you have a great chance to talk to friends, or family. @CAPS1 are so many ways! Secondly, education is a great topic for this subject sometimes teachers ask students to go online to their website, to eather do homework or to do something online. Other times is to get pictures on @ORGANIZATION1, for kids projects. Like people say, ""everything happens for a reason."" @CAPS1 are many websites on the internet for everyone of all ages to get on to learn something. Some accually have wonderful information that everyone should know. Lastly, food is my last reason why computers are good for us. Well, first of all, everyones heard of weight loss programs on the internet and some really work. Others cost money, and others don't. Thus, talking about adults for this situation internet will be needed greatly sometimes. Another fantastic reason is razors. Some can be online also. And this is an awesome way to get bread, candy, ect. What would you do without the internet doing all these creative things? How about not helping with your work? or what are student and kids going to do when they need to know something? my opinion on the effects computers have on people are important facts to know and think about. Lets pay attention and realize that computers are good for us!",9
2284,"Dear local Newspaper, I have been informed that you would like people to write letters of the effects of computers. I think computers have very good effects on people for the most part. In a recent study, @PERCENT1 of kids and adults had a good effect on computers. I think they allow us to learn new things, teach hand-eye coordination and allow us to connect with others. my first reason why I think computers have good efforts is because they allow us to learn new things. Theres so many sites that are appropriate and give valuable information. The older you get the more projects for school you have to do and without a computer it can be very difficult to learn about that certain project. Computers have so many sites and groups that give imformation and just sites that have learning games. My second reason is because they come with another good reason, when your doing all that typing your practicing hand eye coordination. You keep looking back and forth and your actually learning a skill that is very useful to life. Also when your typing your exercising your hands and working your muscles. learning hand eye coordination is good especially for sports; like baseball, tenis, softball, so learning it early can help you become a better sports player. Finally, my last reason is connection on computers. Over the years many of my closest friends have moved, but recently, I have been able to stay in touch with one because of resorting to the computer, now that we can talk we can share pictures and chat. Computers are very useful in that you can stay in touch with friends and family. If you use the sites appriatly you can connect and talk to friends, they allow you to involve yourself in friends lifes. Now adays they have many sites you can use and chat with others. Computers are very useful in that they have many advantages, they have many learning sites, to read and learn new things, they teach hand, eye coordination by typing and looking on the computer, and they allow you to chat or keep in touch with old friends, new ones and family. Its now or never, computers have way more pro's than con's, I think computers have many effects and are a very good invention and are great in everyday lives.",9
2285,"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers do benefits society because if helps people to learn about places all over the world. People also became more sociable, there is classes online and if you have friends or family members that live for, far away from you, you can keep in contact coith them in many ways! My first reason why computers benefit our society is because it helps people to learn about places all over the word. If you go online you reasearch a name of a place and learn history all about it, this kind of websites also include photos. This information might help you for school work and even for publicity. One time I had a @CAPS1 studies project on china the internet helped me find information about history, religion, holldays, places to tour and spend vacation at. Because of the computer I had all the information I needed and got an A on my project. My second reason why computers beefits our society is because it help people become more so dable, for example if you have friends and family members that live on the other side of the world well guess what? you chat and sometimes spend time with them. When I say spend time with them I mean by webcam. Webcam is a device you connect to your computer and it's like a video camara, you just sit in front of if and watchers what you do. If you want to do this with a person the other person must have a webcam too. You can also chat online with people and send pictures to others through email. I have family members in @CAPS2-@CAPS3 that have computers too and I always communicate online with them and look at pictures of my family though they are not near me. It is really fun and you can't do this without an computer. My third reason why computers benefit our society is because some people don't have enough time to drive back and forth to colleges so, @CAPS4 take online classes. Online classes are just like school and you also pay for education just like any other college. I know this because my cousin graduated from high school but is working very hard to have enough money to buy a car that she can drive back and forth to college. She does not want to waste her fine looking and at home doing anything so she goes on her computer and take online college classes. If it wasn't for a computer she would not be learning and taking her education seriously. So, there you have it. Those are some reasons why I think computers benefit our society. with computers people are more sociable, You get education, You can keep in contact with friends and family members all over the world, no matter where they're at. Computers are very useful!",10
2286,"@CAPS1 I just stay up for a couple more hours? I'm really busy and have a lot of homework! @CAPS2 all of the children around the world addicted to the computer. @CAPS5 these days spend about @NUM1 hours on the computer a day! Even though parents hear excuses that their children are working on homework, did you ever think what happens when you walk away? They minimize their essay, research and other homework and start chatting with their friend on @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and all of the other hundreds of websites that connect with your friends. As being the local newspaper it is your job to put an end to this computer addiction! It is shown by experts that @CAPS5 need more @CAPS6, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. First off, computersdefinitely do not benefit society because of the time it has taken away from peoples lives. Citizens of the world should be outside on the beautiful @DATE1 day, or the first snow of the winter, instead cooped inside their homes @CAPS6 has been locking all around the world and it is coused by our laziness. About @PERCENT1 of the world is overwheight which is @NUM1 out of every @NUM3 people. It is also one of the main reasons of death. Just by turning off the computer, people @CAPS1 enjoy the outdoors, run around with their neighbors, friends, and siblings and actually enjoy it. Why should people waste their time chatting with friends, when you could invite them over and play outside? That means, you are excercising, enjoying nature and having fun all at once! Secondly, computers have a lot of effects towards people because it takes time away from family and friends. In my experience, I would much rather want to go to the park with my family than play games on the computer. It also gives @CAPS5 a chance to interact more with their families which gives them more support. I have had a friend who started failing classes because problems with parents. If she spent less time on the computer and more time with family and friends, things would have been different. Lastly, having @CAPS5 spend less time on the computer, would bring those bills way down, and would a lot of energy. Also, if you really have to speak with your friends that lise far away, there's an invention called a telephone instead of talking for an hour on the computer, pick up the phone and call them. This way, your mom and dad @CAPS1 go on and pay bills or do work! The other reason why computers are unhealthy for society because of pressure in school. Teachers expect you to type essays, look up research. but how come we @CAPS1't hand write it? This way you will save energy and money, and you could always type it at school. For research, you @CAPS1 get a book such as an atlas or an encyclopedia. In conclusion, computers do not need to be in our lives anymore. Being the local newspaper, it is easy to spend the world around to abandoned using computers. This way, people will get more exercise, enjoy nature, spend time with family and friend and save money. As experts say computers @CAPS1 take away a whole year in an average lifetime! Just image...what could you do with an extra year?",10
2287,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 much would our daily lives be affected if we didn't use computers? I feel that the use of computers greatly benefits our daily lives. Computers help us in many ways, including keeping in touch with far away friends. They also help alert people of up to the minute news. @CAPS7 you can see, Computers have many positive effects on our society. Have you ever had a friend move far away? Sure you could visit them every once in a while but computers help people keep in touch with one another. I know from experience @CAPS2 easy it is to keep in touch with someone. Using computers, one of my friends moved away last year and I am still constantly talking to her. Because of computers, we can email each other when get the chance and we still remain close friends, Other thing that are helpful computer are social networking sites. These @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 help people to stay in touch with each other. for example, some of my friends still communicate with camp friends through those sites. They even helped them become closer friends. @CAPS7 you can see, Computers make it much easier to communicate with friends that live farther away. This aspect is one of the great benefits of computers on modern society. Another great impact computers have made on society is bringing news to people very quickly. Instead of having to wait for the weather report to come on television in the @TIME1. I just check the computer; @CAPS6 weather reports, computers also have reports or to news stories. @CAPS2 many have you been the news, waiting for and then you over twenty minutes, or wasting your time because the hasn't come on and it is time for you to go? I know that happened frequently to my mother. The problem was solved when I told her to look on the computer. Now, she doesnt waste her time waiting for the story to come on the @LOCATION1, computers also helped us find out about school delays or @CAPS7 you can see computers help people with things they do daily such @CAPS7 checking weather, finding out about top news stories, or hearing about @CAPS8 computers help people They can help to find out about weather or news; to keep in touch with an old friend. I understand the arguments that online communication can never sometimes it is very hard to get to see people in @CAPS9 @CAPS1 would agree that computers have greatly benefit our day to day lives our lives would be much without the use of computers, @CAPS7 you can see computers better our lives on a @CAPS10 of ways.",10
2288,"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The computer is perhaps, on of the most enterprising inventions. They broaden horizons for children eager to learn and make communication much more sufficient. Furthermore, computers encourage the development in had eye coordination for people of all ages. Withought adoubt, computers are not only a major attribute to the successes of people all around the world, they are the solution, and they will and should forever be part of our growing culture. It is important to note that computers provide a learning environment, for children and adults, teenagers and grandparents. Before the invention of computers, to write a paper, one would need to goto the library. Now, right in your own home, you can access trillions of website for more information than a library could every provide. Additionally, computers enable people to learn and understand culture goverments and people around the world. Whether you want to learn about religion, or the rules of soccer, the internet is your gate to new discoveries. It is also important to note, by having access to computer people will be able to learn about you, and perhaps be introduced to your product. People can now read books on line and they can learn different languages. The possibilities are endless. As I mentioned, computers even allow people to talk online with other people. Facebook, twitter, instant message, and email are allways to communicate with friends co-workers or family. More recently, computers now are capable of showing alive feed from person to person . This enables people to not only talk but virtually be with that person. Also, computers are home to many software programs in which you can meet perhaps the love of your life. Onsight such as eharmony, you can communicate with people who share similar intrests as you make a bond to last a lifetime. Equally as important, computers encourage the development of fine motorskills. Obviously, typing is a challenging process for many that requires practice, building up hand eye cooordination. By typing you strengthen your fingers and increase your endurance. On the otherhand , some educational computer games also build up hand eye coordination for people of all ages. Although some critics say that computers take the place of interacting with family and friends, it is evident that computers incourage communication with relatives and people around the world, via eharmony or facebook. As a whole, computers are positive to our growing and enterprising culture. the time has come to tell the world really how vital they are to everyone. They provide an adequete place for learning for people of all ages and enable people to communicate with others more quickly and easily. The development of computers also help to build the strength of fingers, and also hand eye-coordination, Are you going to surpass this chance we have for great success? Everyone knows that computers @MONTH1 be a distraction but the are what best for our future. They play a big role in the development and success of our society.",11

Maybe people are using computers too much and are not getting the only exercise they need but really, computers are a very reliable resource to learn from. Computers help many people in many different ways. You can explore different parts of the world in a computer you can also learn a new language on a computer Computers are so high and these days that you can practically learn anything you want off of a computer. Having computers in school makes it even easier to learn because they are musch faster than turning pages through a five hundred paged text book. Technology these days can truly change peoples lives there love, having computers is a good thing. If you ever need to tell your friend something but they are on the other side of the world, you can send them an e-mail. This helps many people reach others much faster.

Computers can change people lives forever, computers can help you meet new people and also make you wait to create a computer of your own. Overall, computers can change peoples lives and make people much more aware of what is going on in the world. Although computers are quite amazing things, unfortunately they do take away a lot of time from your normal life. Parents often put a limit on computer use if you are on the computer too often or if you can't seem to get off with the technology these days, you can't seem to get off at the electronics. Computers are very fun to use daily but try not to get lost in the world of computers. The main time computers take away from a persons life is exercise time. If you do not play a sport, then it is even harder to get off of the chair and go exercise for at least thirty minutes. This is one of the things that are causing people to be more overweight than usual. Although computers are great, they are adictive and can change your life for the worse. In the end, computers are an advanced technology that make peoples lives much easier. But, they can change your lives for the worse.

2290,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 out of ten people use computers every day. That’s why I strongly agree with this satement: That people are spending to much time on the computer. One, people aren't interacting with family and friends, people are obessed about computer and people getting overweight. On many laptops and computer there are @CAPS2 (you can buy them in the stores too.) @CAPS2 are fun loot, however instead of walking to your friends house you just type with them. Interacting with family and friends face to face not with a computer in between is better. For example, @PERSON2 has a webcam on her computer and she talks with @PERSON1. Who @PERSON2 could just walk down the street to talk too. Do you notice your kids not interacting with you, newspaper readers? When you walk by your kids computer do you see them switching the. The page that they don't let you see is, @CAPS3 or myspace. People are getting @CAPS3 or land myspace accounts when they are as young as @NUM1 years old. For example, when @PERSON2 got a @CAPS3 I would see her on. Therefore she is addicted to the computer. When I was over her house, readers, she would always be on the computer. Now I never go over her house because thats all she would do. People are getting addicted to social networking on the computers. Have you, local newspaper, notice after you made an account on the computer you gained some weight? I have notice my friend @PERSON2 has. When you came home from work or school you find you selve getting chips and the computer? I even sometimes do that but not everyday. Moreover people rather go on the computer than go for a sun. No wonder why they call @CAPS6 one of the fatest countries. As you can see, Readers, computers are taking over our lifes. People aren't being socail without a computer, adults and kids cure getting obessed with computers. Moreover, people are getting over weight and not exercising. Americans, we need to a stop to these.",9
2291,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think the amount of time people spend using the computer is just fine. I think this because even though people do use the computer, it is a great way to learn about faraway places and their cultures. It also teaches hand-eye coordination and allows people to talk online with each other. In this every, I will explain the benefits of using computers. The first benefits, as I about is that the computer will allow people to learn about faraway places and other cultures. @CAPS1 example, if I wanted to learn about @LOCATION1, I could just type up the word @LOCATION1 on google, and link to at things. Which opposes to having to find a book or even going to the library just to find one book on it. And did you know that @PERCENT1 of all computer technicians @CAPS2 that it is quicker to look things up on the internet then look things up in a book? that is @CAPS3 first reason. @CAPS3 second reason is hand-eye coordination. This would help in sports, @CAPS1 example, if you are playing football, you would be able to track where are ball is going and catch it than someone who doesn't use the computer as much. Hand -eye coordination also helps because in you get into you are able to throw and block punches quicker. Keep reading on to see @CAPS3 third and find argument. @CAPS3 third and final reason is that you are able to talk with people all across the world. @CAPS1 example, @CAPS2 you have an who has to go to @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 a year. You would be able to talk to her using @ORGANIZATION1 or video chat. That way you can keep in touch with loved ones even they are away. So @CAPS3 there reason why computers are good is because you are able to learn about far away places and cultures, @CAPS3 second reason is that using a computers can hand-eye coordination. And @CAPS3 third and final reason is that you are able to talk to loved ones even though they @MONTH1 be far away. So I think computers should be to be used as much as they do today.",8
2292,"Dear Local Newspaper, I want to explain how computers affects people lives, one is that it can give your important information, two you can out an more important things in life, and three you can learn about different culture and languages. My first reason why I want to explain how computer affects people. You can learn important information for instins you can look up a biography for a writing test or thing you just want to be aware of, you are intrest in. My second reason is you can out on more important things in life like family and communicating with them & having fun go outside for some fresh air once in a while and stop playing video games on the computer. My third reason why computers can affect a person life is that you can learn different cultures and language like getting information on your ancestors and how they live their lifes and what are their traditions, languages because if you want a specific job that requires a certain language you can search website that can teach you. I choose the three reasons because their are times when you can look information up and other times when you spend quality time with family and friends, and last look up your past lives like your ancestors.",7
2293,"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 you know over @NUM1 million people use a computer? The reason why people use computers is for a few reasons. Weather it is their @CAPS4, hobby, or their buisness. The computer is a fascinating piece of technology. But Other people believe computers can ruin lifes. Or make people @CAPS5-@CAPS6. So the question everyone is asking is @CAPS7 computers be used as much as they are. Almost every one in @LOCATION1 has a computer. But many people who love new gaddets and technology somtimes forget that health comes first. @CAPS3 you know that @LOCATION1 is one of the least healthy countries on the earth? @ORGANIZATION1 says that computers are an active contributer to americas bad health. Computers were originaly made to make everyday tasks easier. But in my opinion it makes it harder because people are always glued to their computer. What are computers really used for today? The first thing people think of when they hear the word computer is internet. The internet is the main reason people are so glued to their computer. This is because people can always find some kind of new website. Their are billions of websites now its not even funny. The internet is probably the main cause of kids wanting to stay inside instead of exploring and having fun outside. If you are a parent do you want the best for your child? If so you @CAPS7 tell them all the basic necesities that a human needs in order to survive. For example tell them they need exersize, healthy foods, clean water, and shelter. Also tell them about when you were a child and might not have had a computer. This could be a huge step toward in our countries/world health. Not only for the world but also for all your friends and family. So now its time to decide the fate of @LOCATION1. @CAPS7 we be idolized or be shuned upon. I think the decision is clear. So if you really want to start making people of all ages become better people what you can do. If you go to your friends/family and tell them they are on the computer to much they will listen to you if they care about you. If every one in the world does this we might just fix all bud things having to do with this generation.",9
2294,"Dear @CAPS1 post, I think computers have a good effect on people and thier safty. Computers are a wounderful technology to have, espechaly with a wed cam. Computers are also easyer for school projects. Last but not least, computers are used in our military to keep us safe. Putting a web cam on a computer is an exanlant idea. A douter and son can see his or her dad thats been away on a busisness trip for mounthys or maybe evan years. An example in my life that a web cam came in handy was when my friend had a forien exchanged student from @LOCATION1 come to his house for a year. He was able to talk to his parents anytime he wanted to. He also got to introduce his parents to the people he was living with. Computers are a easy to look up information for school. For example, I forgot to read a book and do a project on, but I forgot to read the book and the project was do in @NUM1 days. What do I do? You can google a summary of the book and all you need to know is right thier. Computers are also good for making your work neeter, and you can print pictures and use that for your work. Computer make the military more safe. Insted of putting solders on the frount line you can have them controll a @ORGANIZATION1 preditor. A @ORGANIZATION1 preditor is a computer controlled plane shoots a computer controlled missilels were our enemys are hiding. Computers lets us know if there is an enemy country trying to invade our country, and about @PERCENT1 of our military and army are made up of computers. Computers are a big important technology in our country. Ya maybe kids are playing computer games then getting exsersize. Computer games slow up the computer anyway, and parent have to put a limmit to the games to. So my three reasons; talking to family, school work, and military and army benifits. State why I think computers are good not bad for our country in the @LOCATION2 And I hope you think the same way.",8
2295,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you were around the age of @NUM1 did you have a computer? Or did you have to go to the library to use the computer? Computers have an effect on people both in a positive and negative. Personally, I think computers help with learning and interacting with people. But, there are people that disagree, with me, and think computers can cause health problems. The issue is, are computers good or bad for people. Read on to see why think computers have a good effect on people. School is one of those places where in can be fun but also can be boring. Learning has to do a lot with our future. Computers make it very easy for us. My school books are very heavy, and big. Sometimes if I have a lot of homework I don't take them home. Instead, I will go on the computer and research my topic. Now and days we rely on computers a lot. ""@CAPS1 teachers need worksheets they will go on the computer and print something out."" @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1. So you see it is not only me that thinks computers help with school. We also do projects on them. Growing up did you have a lot of friends or were you the person in the corner. Today, there are so many chatrooms. For example, @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @LOCATION1, etc. You can go on these and interact with other people. Facebook and @CAPS4 let you and friends. You can talk to them and @CAPS1 you go to school you will have something to talk to them about. The computer lets you join chat rooms in which you will meet new people. You can talk to someone across the world too. My cousin has a computer pal. A computer pal is @CAPS1 you are a type of older brother or sister to somebody. This person is across the world from you.. You don't see them in person. The computer can teach you how not to be shy and helps you interact with new people. You've heard the up side of computers but now its time for you to hear the down side. Many people belive computers can cause health problems. Computers also lets you play games. Which can cause lazziness. I was watching @CAPS5. They were talking about kids that use the computer for @NUM2 hours playing games. Now they play proffinal computer games. Those people @CAPS3 they have depression so games make them feel better. All the people on the show wear glass. Most of the people were fat. They stop exercising because they don't want to stop playing their game. Would you want your kids to damage their health. The time has come. It's now or never. What is your opinion? What time of effect to computers have. Personally, I think computers have a positive effect. Computers are a good way to interact with people. Studies show over @PERCENT1 say it helps with learning. Or are you against my opinion? Computers can cause lazziness and serious health problems. Your child can become overweight by not getting exercise.",10
2296,"Did you think the computers are necessary for us? Many people think the is not necessary have a computer in the house, but other people think the is necessary have a computer in the house. Three reasons, first some kids have home work to do they need to find information or pictures. Second the people need to do work like type a information for the work. Last if we don't have computers we can communicate with - they family of other contry. Sometimes the teachers give homework to find information for a home work. The teachers say the somtimes we need the information for class work if they don't finish they can find the information agen so the kids need a computer. Sometimes the kids whant to have a picture for paint or draw. In a fabric need informetion for how many the workers are mead of fabric. They need to type the informetion for too know how many they need to pay to the workers. They need to type a letter for others persons. Persons like us have familys in other countries. Sometime they whant to talk but they don't have cellphone or a phone. They use the webcam to talk for the webcam can see aech others. The conclushion is the people need a computer for a good no bad. I think this speech work in something to you. Thanks you.",8
2297,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 I think, this whole idea with us people being on the computer too much is kind of dumb. Being on the computer way too long can blind you. If, you choose to start to spend more time with the computer more than you spend time with your family and friends they'll probably start noticing it. lastly, that also can make you gain weight. Being on the computer can make you loose your eyesight because, basicly its like your looking at a light for atleast three or more hours and usually when your looking at a light or something bright you start to loose your eyesight. It doesn't help you at all. Especially, if you already wear glasses and have horrible eyesight. Another thing is that a lot of others start to use the computer more than they spend time with there loved ones. I think thats pretty bad if your starting to forget about your own family and friends. the people that care about you, because that can turn into something really bad. They start to think that your trying to avoid one another. That's not to good for anyone. Also, when you sit on the computer for a long time and eat and play or read whatever's on the screen. That's basicly gaining weight. Your eating and not even working it off. That's real bad for your health too! I, rather us eat then exercise. I, hope you took my opinions into consideration, and you use them in a positive way! Thank you for listening.",8

Also, without research people wouldn't live as easily and possibly less healthier if they use the internet to consult online health experts regarding their health. Some people @MONTH1 over-use their computers and ignore socializing which is not good nor is it healthy.

Another reason is that going blind could waste a lot of money for glasses and there about @NUM1! Many family can't afford glasses that make their children can't see! Another way computer has bad effect on people is that their body isn't right. Most people who uses computer everyday and don't excersie are fat. This is bad for your health. For example, I have a grandma who stays on bed and watch @CAPS1 every day. This is like usingthe computer. It turn out that her blood pressure was high since she don't move. It causes her to have stroke and now she in a nursing home. As we can see this could happen to people who uses computer everytime of their lives. Another way it bad for your body is because will spend less time with family number. Spending less time with family will make relationship of one another just break apart. For example, I have a dad who always go to friend house and newer spend time with me and my sis. So my dad and I don't really get along. So that why using computer bad for your health. Therefore, computer is bad for everyone. Next computer effect one bad for little kids. There bad because now website has ad that show someone naked or something not appropriate. As the parents can see this is bad for children who don't know anything nad start talking aobut it in school. Also sometimes computer show bad word and soon those kids who see it will learn the word and start to swear. A memory I had is that one day I was on the ocmputer and saw bad word and ever a lady in a bikini. As you can see I was very affonded by sseeing that. I was confused, another reason computer effect kids i because lots of the website give flase information aobut website a child went on to search sometimes it should give a child a incorrect information. One day I wnent on wikipedia and search panda. It said that the panda was blue. And we know it not right but the children don't know that. There, computer have a bad effect on children. Last but not least, computer effect is ad for people health. For example, I have a friend who eat junk food, while on the ocmputer doing something everyday. this was bad for her health. It turn out she had to go to the doctor for eating to much junk, see!! The computer mader has not exercise reusing her to be in a unhealthy situation. Also, most people would sit and look at the computer. This is bad for everyone blood pressure. Expecially when we eating and sitting. This could cause all of have high colesteo. another reason istant no one will excercise making you body fat and won't decrease fat cell. As we can see it bad for everyone health. Therefore, computer is bad for you. In conclusion, computer effect are bad for people and should be step. Since, it not good for everybody by not talking to family. Also computer effect is bad for little kid, since the bad ad. And last it always bad for your health. Thus, people should only use computer if needed.",11
2300,"Dear, Newspaper I think that computers are a good thing because you can talk to friends and family online. Also, I think Computers are a good thing because you can look up homework on it. Last, I think computers are a good thing because your hand-eye coordination will increase. Let's explore why I think it's good to talk to family and friends over the computer. First, because you can chat on aim and have a conversation. Also, you talk on facebook to see what your friends interested in and what they look like. Last, I think it's a good thing because you can also video chat to see how much older a family member is getting and just to make it feel like your talking to them right there if they far apart. Let's @CAPS1 why I think its good looking up homework. First, I think it's good for looking up home work because you can go on google or another site to look up something you don't understand or cause that's the only place to get the answer. Also, I think the computer is good for homework because if you left it in school you can get it off edline a school website that teachers post homework on. Last, I think that the computer is good for homework because for say math homework you don't have a calculator you can use the one on your desktop and if your computer dosen't have it you can type the math question in on google and it will give you the answer. Let's find out why I think that it will increase you hand-eye coordinaton skills. First, I think this because you typing will increase because you will wanna type quicker and you will start to know were all the keys are. Also, I think it would increase because if you play a sport your using hand-eye coordination. Last, it would increase because if you sit there typing and typing you will just get better. Now that's why I think computers are good and not bad for you. So I hope you take my ideas into consideration.",8
2301,"Dear @CAPS1-in-@CAPS2, More and more people today are using computers. They are making our lives better and easier, giving us a lifestyle that our ancestors couldn't of dreamed of. Computers make our world a better place. The society of mankind has always been social one. We @CAPS4 human beings have the need to be around and know about our friends and family. With computers, this has become drastically simpler and easier. Facebook, founded by @NUM1 years old @PERSON2 for the students of @ORGANIZATION1, is a site that allows not only communications, but true connection. A recent article in the @ORGANIZATION2 stated that @PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION2 had a facebook account. This is an incredible amount of people and because of this, not only kids but adults can connect with old friends that they don't know about. You never know, that third grade friend of your's might be the newest billionare. Let's say you did connect with an old friend on facebook, how would you communicate? With another invention that has changed our world forever, @CAPS3. Why send that message via ""snail mail"" when you easily have it sent and recieved in minutes. @PERSON1, a small buisness owner, recently stated, ""@CAPS3 allows met to connect with my customers, I can talk to them and get feed back on my products."" @CAPS4 you can see, @CAPS3 has helped @PERSON3 tremendously, @CAPS4 it does the rest of the world, even kids. But if your young, you might want something even better and faster than @CAPS3. What is this, you ask? Kids today can connect with each other over instant messaging, more commonly known @CAPS4 @CAPS5. @PERCENT2 of kids between the ages of @NUM2 and @NUM1 talk to each other over istant messaging. This allows them to chat and communicate, a proven thing to help kids develop socially, according to the medical examiner through all those advances computers help us to ""get connected"". For a moment, lets forget social networking, and get to something a touch more serious, buisness. The world revolves around money and buisness, just look around you. Most buisness run on computers, all of their records and information is all in computers. Remember those days when you would ""punch in"" a time card, well not anymore. These days you would swipe your key card through a scanner. Not only small buisnesses, but the biggest buisnes in the world is run by computers. The stock market is managed and dictated through computers. In fact, @PERCENT3 of investors buy their stocks online, on sites such @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION3. And where do people get this money? It all comes from the banks. Online, people can manage their accounts or see if they can afford that @ORGANIZATION2 car. If you look at it mathmatically. According to the transition property. If computers run buisnesses in the world, the computers in the world. Through all of this, people need to know things. And the easiest way to do that is online. You can even get your daily news online, almost @PERCENT4 of news companies have websites, so you can check out the weather in @LOCATION3, or what just happened in the olympics. It is possible to go to @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION2.com and check out what is going on the world. Its not only news thats online, it's everything. Through search engine such @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION4, one can find anything and everyone. Rose of the hospital for special surgery stated, ""I was about to perform surgery on a young man. I noticed a small if the bone marrow, so I googled it and saw it was a prelude to cancer"" This @ORGANIZATION4 result @MONTH1 men's life! We can also look back in history, @PERCENT5 of history is online, and anyone can access it. Through these advances, we have made human smarter. Computers have changed our world, we a the technology age an ages I am happy to be a part of. Computers make a world a better place.",12
2302,"Dear our local Newspaper, I support the advances in technology in our town. Having the modern computers around are easily a benefit to society. The computer allows everyone to communicate with family, friends, or people from your business. They can be used for local news, weather, and/or sports scores from a big game you didn't get to watch. Last, they can be used to research anything anyone would ever want to know. Computers and modern advances in technology, can allow our community to talk and write to people all over the world. Wether it is to talk with a friend to ask about a homework question, to talk about a business, or if you have a relative that, for example, went to the war and doesnt have a cell phone, you can find plenty of ways to communicate over the internet. Today there are plenty of different sources to talk to people with. There are @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1 and lots of others.

2303,"Dear @CAPS1. Do you thin that computers are good to the society. Fist a computer is a faster way of doing reaserch. Second the computers reach hand-eye cordination. It alows people to contact each other. A computer is a faster way or doing reaserch. I has a science project, and with one website I had the hole info. I also use my computer to type my homework and email it to the teachers. I also have microseft word , wich is a easier way to stady from my slife show. As you can see a computer can make my life easier. Second, computers reach hand-eye cordination. I know because I contact the mause with my hand but I dont look at it. I have a @NUM1 and I was asking my self how do I. Use a control with out looking at it. hand-eye is like multy task. Some times I say to my self if we learned to hand eye imagine in the future. Third it alows us to contact others. My laptop has a webcam so every @DATE1 we see my my sister. The webcam is an easy way to talk and see others. You can also see other people with skype or @ORGANIZATION1. As a result it turns out to be good. As you can see these are my reasons. Faster way or reaserch. It teaches hand-eye cordinations. It alows you to contact anione on the planet. As you can see a computer is a must have.",7

2305,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 society with active fit neighbors who don’t sit at home and play on the computer for hours. Taking away computers in our society will help the health and saftey of out people. I demand you to make this choose. Its important for our health. We shouldn't be staring at a computer for too long like most of us. We should be going for a jog or to the gym not sitting staring at a screen. My cousin @PERSON2 from @LOCATION3 was obese. She use to spend @NUM1 hours on the computer each day. Soon she realized she was @NUM2 pounds. She stop playing the computer and started to join a gym. Now, she is @NUM3 pounds and didn't go on her computer since then. Therefore, computers do affect your weight. Also, computers affect you vision. @PERSON2, eye doctor from @LOCATION2, says more people are going blind because they use the computer to much. @PERCENT1 of her patients have contacts or glasses. Don't forget! Even a simple move of a mouse is a health risk. I took a survey of @NUM4 different doctors. They all said many people are getting carbol tunnel from the motion of moving a mouse. Computers are a health hazard to @NUM5's of people. Computers affect the saftey of many people. You never know who is on the other computer. My friend @PERSON4 from @LOCATION4 was on the computer talking to her best friends @PERSON3. @PERSON3 said he didn't want to be friends any more. She asked him in school the next day if it was true and @PERSON3 was confused and didn't know what she was talking about. Their are hackers in the world. @NUM6 out of @NUM5 people get hacked or cond each day. If you don't want to listen to me then listen to @PERSON1, police officer from @LOCATION1, says their are more computer crimes then any other crime in are whole state. Computers aren't the safest way to communicate. Its suprising we haven't got rid off computers already. I does affect the health and saftey of the people in our town. I implore you to take away for these reasons.",9
2306,"Crunch! That is the sound of another kid eating chips while on the computer. More and more kids are becoming overweight because of techknoledgy. Especially computers. People are spending time inside, not exercising. They will stay in their room and become loners too. The last and perhaps most important problem with computers is that they take away our chances to learn. We need to stop this virus of computers now before we are all taken over! Don't you just love to go for a nice run or jog? I do, but now, kids would rather stay inside and play computer games. The number of overweight people in @LOCATION1 have increased a lot since we all had computers. I can remember when I used to spend almost my whole life on the computer it broke down and i had nothing to do, so I started to work out. I lost @NUM1 pounds in one month! Do you see how much better our lives would be without computers. The deaths from sickness do to weight would plummit to almost none. We need to stop using computers so many teens just look themselves away in their room. They stay on the computers and just forget the world around them. They will throw away their whole social life, just to talk to random people on the computer. There are many child abductions in the world to the computer. They meet some stranger online in a chatroom and then they decide to meet in person the next thing you know, the mom is crying and her son/daughter is nowhere to be found. Do you really want this to happen to your child? And this is just one of many problems with computers. When a teacher assigns a book report no one actually does it. They just go on the computer and print one off. This is not going to help us learn. It does the exact opposite of that instead of students actually reading, they just find a quick summary of the book online. If parents want their kids to do well in life, then throw out their computer. Let your kids do work for themselves. I know that from what you just read you can tell that computers have negative effects on people they make us unhealthy, and drive us away from other, we have an easy life because of computers but is it a better one? Computers are bad for us, and now you can see that.",9
2307,"Dear local newspaper, I have heard some peoples opinion’s about computers some say that when people spend time on the computers they spend less time on other things, then I heard that spending time on the computer gives the ability to learn more. Please heed my advice. I agree that computer’s benefit society. First of all, using the computer saves money. For ex. You want to look up book’s to study or read, you can look it up on the computer, then read it online, instead of buying them. You can also watch movies and listen to @CAPS1 on the computer instead of buying them, statistics say that the average people who use the computer, save about half as much as they spend the percentage is @PERCENT1 save @PERCENT2 doesn’t. Computers help in lots of ways, it helps with assignment for school to look more presentable and educated for class, you'll also look prepared. Computers help with presentations for school and for your jobs. I remember when I got my computer I began to know more about technology and things I never knew before, I did presentations using @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I also did math games online to help me with math. Then, two average boys who shared there there names @ORGANIZATION1 there both around @NUM1 the age teens go crazy on technology, @CAPS4 @PERSON2 say’s, “computer’s give people the ability to learn more and learn about different things”. Then @PERSON1 say, “spending too much time on computers take time away from exercise and enjoying nature.” In conclusion, I would like to say that now that you have heard two different opinions including mine that you have more of a better stated opinion.",8
2308,"Dear Local Newspaper, The truth is computers have a negative effect on people. First of all, people spend too much time on the computer and forget that they have a real @CAPS6. Millions of people create unhealthy relationships with people they might not even know. Harvard studies show that @PERCENT1 of teenagers have ""friends"" that they only ever talk to on the computer. Some people even get so addicted they forget how to behave & interact with others. For example, @PERSON1 of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 once said, ""@PERCENT2 of kids who own a computer, don't have many friends because they have forgotten the appropriate way to act. Another thing is, spending so much time on the computer is an unhealthy decision. Once you make it, you don't have another option. Although there is so much information on the internet, it's not the best way to learn it. First of all, it takes the joy out of learning. Wouldn't you rather go swimming than look up if humans are less dense than water? According to a @CAPS4 study, @PERCENT3 of children & adults can absorb more information if they learn it hands on. You can think of a computer like potato chips. Once you experience it once, you just can't stop. If you're always on the computer, there's always another way of doing the same on the computer. Some people will argue you can learn hand-eye coordination by using the computer. In the end, computers don't make you happy, so why not learn the skill by playing tennis or piano? Also, if you're a parent that is always on the internet, you're setting a bad example for your children by giving them the message of being lazy & don't do anything with your lives. By being active a @ORGANIZATION1 study shows that you will be more likely to pick an apple as a snack then a chocolate bar because you want to feel good about yourself. It is important for our community that we raise children with a good, succesful background that know how to interact & cooperate with others. Lastly, the only thing the computer is good at is spending all of your money. In a highschool student poll, most children would choose a free way of hanging out with friends than having to spend money & repairs to video chat. With computers, you don't get the full effect of anything you do, & they even make you pay for it. Also, it becomes a competition of who's got the most up-to-date technology which is another bad habit to get into. Oprah @CAPS5 once said, ""@CAPS6 is a way better bargain than a computer."" @CAPS7, computers have a negative effect on all people of size, color, & age. they don't let you live the full, healthy, care-free, joy as @CAPS6 you are supposed to have a choice to have.",10
2309,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I believe that the use of computers is out of control. If people keep on letting the computer take over their life, then pretty soon you wont remember how to talk to people in person, wich is just one way that computers are changing people. In no time at all people will be so consumed with being on their computers that america will become more obsess then we already are last, computers are a recourse to do work and research, if we are using them for other things we could be in a bit of trouble. It is shown in recent research that @PERCENT1 of americans use online sites. If this keeps going on through the computer then in no time at all people would be extremly unsociable because that forgot hour to talk to people in person. Without their computers they don't have time to think about what they are going to say next, this will lead to a very awkward situation wich no one enjoys. Instead of being on a dating sit then for you could go out with your friends and have a good time and meet people, wich I personly think a person I dont even know who they are. Imagine, its a beautiful day you are about to up your dog and go for a jog in the park but then uou hear the all to ""you got mail"". You forget about your dog and the jog and go over to your computer to check out you emailed you this could lead to a very unhealthy habbit that we cant afford. America is already clasified so over weight, so do you think instead of going out on a nice day, that you are huncher over at your desk typing on a computer, soon our country will have a major issue, so set off of that computer and go outside! Im not saying that compiuter amt a greta recourse to look up information on but that is all they should be used. If everyone used computers for only work then there would be no longer issue at all, but that far from happining. I think people should only be to use computers for work and education purposes, wouldn't that be the day. Now I hope you relize how computers are affecting people by making them home and be less not going out to nexercise and not uses them for only. I hope you listen to my reasons and use your computers more now!",9
2310,"In my opinion I think people spend more time on the computer when they could be outside enjoying nature with friends and family. Therefore I think that most experts are right people should get off the computer and get outside. The three reasons that support my decision are people health less bonding time with others and that a computer screen can hurt your eyes in the long run. The health of people these days is going down more people are becoming obese and some of the reason is the @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 screens they are sitting behind inside. Studies have shown @PERCENT1 of obese people are on the computer for more the @NUM1 hours in one day. When I feel when there is nothing to do you could go outside play a sport take a walk. there are so many things to do outside and it makes me think why people don't go out and enjoy it! Some people use the excuse of its winter so I can't go outside but you can go outside all year-round. My second reason is you can bond with friends and family. I would rather talk to someone face-to-face than on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 messager. When you sit on the computer you won't get to talk or see anyone and you will lose social skill from just talking to people on @CAPS2. You might never want to get off the computer but think about it you would be able to hang out with them at cinerom or fuzion zone. My third reason is using a computer can hurt your eyesight in the long run. Staring at that bright screen for a while espically everyday can put a strace on your eyes and can make your eye sight go bad. Computers aren't helping you they are actually hurting you. So if you want good eyesight get of the computer and get into exercise and the beauty of nature. In conclusion if you want to be a friendly fun to talk to, skinny person with great eye sight hop out of those computer chairs and into nature. The choice is up to you.",8
2311,"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you today to discuss computers having a problem with human nature. Meaning, many people not going outside for fresh air or not exercising. A question that goes through my head is, ""do computers give knowledge?"" @CAPS1 that I mean do people get smarter when on the internet because people have a chance to read on learn new things like new words. People say that @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 has interfered with school work and dont get it done, but kids when on the internet get to talk friends and family is useful. Computers have advanced our technology and @MONTH1 bring it to the next level. In my own opinion computers aren't interfering with exercising or enjoying nature because people see creative ideas to do in nature for example, when people are ""bored"" they @MONTH1 go on youtube to maybe find something to do just to got the brains pumping and discover new things. Usually people have been becoming addicted to the internet and wont let up, because the internet is basicly a virtual world and make us really creative like I said before. As as virtual world I mean people who enjoy the process of @CAPS5 thats why some people become. This is my statement on my opinion to what effects computers have on people.",8
2312,"Dear whom ever it @MONTH1 concern, I agree with the people that this doesn't benefit society. My first reason is we don't get up and go outside. My second reason we don't sleep much. My last reason we don't do much homework. First, we don't get up and play outside, we don't enjoy the fresh air. For example, we stay playing games or listening to music, that we don't even get are exercise. People ask, ""why people gain wieght?"" @CAPS1, because they spend all the time on the computer, just sitting there. This is important because we need are exercise to get healthy, but with technology all they get is being lazy. Second, we don't get are rest, are @NUM1 hours of sleep. For example, people stay up on the computer until its atleast @NUM2 or @NUM3 o'clock in the @TIME1. What do they do through out the hours? @CAPS1, they be on myspace, yahoo, aol, and/or @CAPS2. This is important because you need to sleep to walk up to go to work, school, or even for the @ORGANIZATION1. Lastly, we don't get homework done. For example, we get name from school and get right away plugged in, is like if we are the computer's plug. Why do they rush to the computers? @CAPS1, because they want to find out about gossip or the latest games. This is important because we need are education. In conclusion, @CAPS3, we do need are computers, but not all the time not for games or myspace. This is not as important as your health or as your education. Computers don't give your life or your career, You do!",8
2313,"Many people have different ideas on computers. Some say computers have positive effects and others are more towards the negative side. I am towards the negative side. With computers, companies lose money, people don'@CAPS2 get enough excircise and relationships are reducing. Computers have everything you could ever watch, play, and dream of in them. That is why companies like comcast, @ORGANIZATION1, and music industries are losing money. People don'@CAPS2 want to pay for @CAPS1., games, and music so they go on the computer to watch it. On the computer free @CAPS2.V. is very popular. You watch you favorite show whenever you want to, for free! My favorite website is @CAPS3 because it has every video you can ever want to watch. I go on there and watch it for hours. It's a really bad habit. Millions of people watch it everyday and night! Computer games are now very popular. You can play them for free and never get tired of them. I play them because I don'@CAPS2 wan'@CAPS2 to spend my money on @MONEY1 games only to have them break when I drop them; I want games that are fun and free. Doctors and experts have seen that now a days people don'@CAPS2 get enough excirsice because they are on the computer all day. This is sad because we should all play outside everyday. What's even worse is that when people are sitting infront of the computer they are eating. This does not burn calories, it infact, does the oposite. In @LOCATION1, this is our biggest problem because we are not getting the exircise or nutrition we need. People need to play outside more and become more healthy or else we'll become less active and move like boulders. Our relations with one another is very immortant for your social health and needs. It gives you a nice balance in peoples lives. Lately this has been a problem because a lot of parents are getting divorced. What do you think coused this problem. People are spending to much time at work. what are they working on I computers. When they get home they will be too focused on their work that they wan'@CAPS2 even say hi to their children and wives. This is very sad because you might never see them agian and your ignoring them. If your a child it will be the same but instead with your friends. Computers do not help your social life. Computers are a way of life for some people. They will never break the habit of it. They are sucked under the spell of the computers and it's a hard spell to break. Computers effects are not benefitial they are hurtful.",10
2314,"Dear editor, I say you should let people go on the computer! A computer lets you do many activites like playing games, socializing, and many other activites. I say you should let people use computers because some people need a computer for work, kids that use computers might want to be video game designers, and you can talk to your friends or family on the computer. If your asking yourself do I really need a computer at work the answer is yes. Some jobs are different than others so you might need a different program on your computer. Take my mom for example she works of @ORGANIZATION1 and she helps people everyday on the computer and on the phone. I say all jobs should have a computer. Did you know @PERCENT1 of kids that played or is still playing video games might want to be video game designers. It's true kids enjoy playing video games on different systems. Eventhough, the computer is where all the videe games are made from. Kids that want to become video game designers want to try to beat the number I video game. Kids just love video games so much and if your addicted to your video game system you might want to become a video game desinger. Have you evern told your friend or family members you would talk to them later? Then they get mad at you because you lied and then they go on thier email and see you emailed them. That's called email you can talk to your friends or family on the computer. It's safe unless you get email from random people, you might want to stay away from those. messages are that cause viruses. Email is the way to talk to your friends or family. BLAM! Thats all I have to say about the subject. So if you didn't catch my reasons some people need a computer for thier job, people who use computers might want to be game designers, and you can talk to your friends or family on the computer.",8
2315,I think people should keep their computers because they need to find job application and they need to send emails to parents to see if they got the job or not. We need computers because kids need to learn how to work with technology and work with the keys and they can play learning games on the computer that teaches them how to read write and spell. And then people who wants to exercie they can mak a plan when people get up hop on the computer and check there email then for like an hour or two they can excersize. And for college and high school kids they need computers to do a essay or exames and type a @NUM1 letter page about something and they can't do that if they don't have computers. When teachers are at work they need to go home and check our homework that was do on the computers and our grades. And job when they run through your lisense it runs through the computer to see if it's your real lisense or not. Police stations needs computers so they can run through your lisences plate. The airport need computers so they can see what flight is going where.,6
2316,"Do you own a computer? Do you use it to work, play games, or even talk to family and friends? Computers are getting more and more popular, and advanced. The use of computers is liked and disliked by various people. I personally agree with the people who like using computers for these next three reasons. If you are a stay at home mom or dad, you can still work, the computer allow you to stay connected with family members and friends, and you can play fun games and such on a computer. These are my three top reasons why I think computers are useful and have a lot of benefits, I wonder what other reasons people could have! To all stay at home mom's or dad's working is not a thing of the past! You are still able to work straight from home! How appealing does that sound? To me, very! Just picture yourself waking up, not even getting out of you're @CAPS1's or if you have a laptop you don't even have to get out of bed! I would think that staying home all day but still making money would sound like a pretty great idea, don't you? Do you have relatives or old friends, or even new friends, that you want to reconnect with? The computer is a great way to do ! Websites such as facebook, myspace, or aim allow you to talk to. right now, I have a screen chatting with people, but only people I know of course! As a matter of fact, facebook helped me find my three friends from us field. When I lived in another town, they were my best friends! I recently was just talking to them. Computers are great for finding and catching up with people! Spending tons of money on pointless video games, x-boxs, or @CAPS2's? There's no need anymore! Computers have many websites with thousands of really fun games! Don't bother wasting your money on things that kids could play for free right on the computer. Even though you're still playing video games which are pretty much pointless in life, kids don't seem to think so, and you can still act great benefits like saving a lot of money! If these three reasons I stated above haven't persuaded you, I don't know what will! I think working from home, talking to friends and family, and playing fun and free games on the computer sounds great! I strongly believe computers can make you're life easier, and you can have a lot of fun on them. After reading my opinion on computers, hopefully you agree with me too!",9
2317,"Dear Local Newspaper I thint that computers have a positive efect on people also they teach hand eye coordination and it helps learn about far away places also you can talk to your friends on line I hope you consider reading on. My first reason is computers have postive efect on people for example they can tell you about your taxes and how much you could recive or they have collge on line were you can work on geting your dirgre if your a dropout you still can get your @CAPS1.E.D. to also on line. My second reason is it teaches hand eye coordination fore example in the school theres this program called type to learn @NUM1 and it work on you typeing skills and how you can improve on typeing skills also help you get familiar with the keys and the letters on the keyboard also there games on how you can become a beater typer. My third reason is how you can learn about far away places a good hotel you can stay for the or help find homes in or visit a frend in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 you could buck a flight or see wich one is cheaper for your bujet and you could go on @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to find were your buddy lives. I hope you consider my persuasive letter you of some reasons first it has a positive effect on people second it teaches hand eye coordination and third you can learn about far away places. I hope you consider my letter.",8
2318,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers and technology have finally caught up with humans in the twenty-first century. These new and highly created devices, known as computers, will help many people succeed and advance in the nearest future. They will help people learn, interact and get smarter through the coming ages. First, computers can help people learn anywhere and everywhere. Whether it be forgotten homework or the latest news-article, computer can help with learning. People don't like to read books; they have the internet reading over a thousand words, even if it's on @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. Not only that, but computers can people learn about the world, by searching it on a search engine. It can help them about a places language, culture, people, food, style, and so much more, with a simple click of a mouse. Second is social interaction. Computers help people communicate to others even if they're far away. Higher and newer technologically advanced computers are very fast nowadays, downloading instant messengers will be a snap! if people have webcams with microphones (built-in or not), it can be use so much more better than a' telephone call; you get to see them and talk to them! Very convenien for families who have sons/daughers who live far away or in college, and also convenient to familes who have loved ones that are around the globe that they can't see. Lastly is computers helping people get smarter. Reading is everywhere that you see and go; so are math, science and social studies! Nowadays, textbooks are online, so they help students do their homework at home if they forgot it or if they were out sick. Online learning can also help homeschooled kids do work and college kids who are staying at home. With the help of faster, better and smarter technology, computers are a helpful and convenient device to people. Computers can help people open their minds with other places and its people and culture, talk online through @CAPS5 or online chat places with family, friends and strangers (whom you should be careful about), and learn online at home and everywhere. Thank you for time in reading my letter.",9
2319,"Dear, to whom ever this @MONTH1 concern In my opinion I think that computers have an neagative affects on people. One of my reasons for feeling this way is that computers could be very harmful to people. Another reason, is that instead of exercising people are on the @CAPS1. Also lastly computers are putting people out of jobs. Computers can be very harmful. There are both of bad things on the @CAPS1, there are also lots of bad people such as child abducters, and killers. You never are really sure who you are talking to because on the @CAPS1 you can pretend to be anyone. You can never be to safe. Secondly, instead of going out and playing or exersising people much rather be on the @CAPS1. A lot of people in @LOCATION1 and all over the world are oveweight. We could all use a little exercise every and in a while. I'm sure if they were more active instead of being on youtube, myspace, facebook, or twitter the rate of people being overweight would go down. Lastly computers are putting people out of a job. A @CAPS1 could basicly do anything more than a person can do. This puts a lot of people out of work. The computers are taking their jobs away, this is not good for the economy. Lots of people need jobs at this time. This is how I feel about computers, that they are dangerous. I think they stop people from exercising. Lastly, they are putting people out of a job.",8
2320,"Have you ever felt like you were missing some things in life? Do you ever wish you chose another job activity that your free time? Now, these questions can be brought to many different points but if a computer comes to mind in any of your answer you need to keep reading. I strongly believe computers have a negative effect on people. First off did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS1 are obese?! This means adults and children are spending too much time in front of the computer and @CAPS2 screens, causing a person to spend less time excersizing. Joining a gym @MONTH1 just be way for you to your social life you go from chatting on instant messaging  to having you-feel +all day you should. Everyone wants a good, strong, supportive, happy family. Happy people have trustworthy friends and know how to laugh with them. Put yourself in this position. Your best friends passed away @TIME1. you were too busy emailing and searching for friends to add on @CAPS3. You didn't answer your phone when your best friend calling because you were ""busy"" @CAPS4't let this be you so for a time to spend with your friends. Have everyone over @CAPS5 to @CAPS5. Our parents, uncles cousins, grandparents and nephews will always be there for help also love and support. A complete is far from helping anyone that so @CAPS4't let your computer become your friend. It's now or never! computers are negatively affecting people but of all this relationship with family and friends. So its your turn to go out there are support getting people. All ages to come outside become happy without computers.",8
2321,"Dear @CAPS1, I feel that the effects that computers have on people is good one for two reasons. One, it allows people to get information faster. Two, it allows people to stay in contact with each other in an easier way. Here are some reasons to support my opinion. My first reason was because it allows people to get information faster. This is a good thing because it allows people to have more free time during the day to either sleep, make food for their families, exersize, or even just to lounge around. For example, a few weeks ago I had a project due for @PERSON1, I am usually very active so I didn't have enough time to do the project. When I woke up the day the project was due I freaked until I remembered that I had a computer, with the computer being there I was able to start and finish a project that would normally take me an hour with books and I finished in @NUM1 minutes and recieved a very high grade, In addition, this is why having a computer is much easier. My second reason is because it allows people to stay in contact with each other longer and in an easier way. The reason as to why I say this is because before my step mom passed away her and my step sister used to talk on email a lot. We lived in @LOCATION1 and @CAPS2 lived in @LOCATION2. Also, it is so much easier because with things such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @ORGANIZATION1. Also you have to do is just sign in and type. In conclusion, these are my two reasons as to why I feel the computer has a good effect on people.",8
2322,"It seems like everyone is using computer today. Male or female, young or old, everybody can benefit from a computer. They are are easy to get and have a large range of pricing. Everyone should own a computer. This technology makes communication easier, provides entertainment and can help for educational purposes. Have you ever called a friend on the phone, only to get their answering machine? If you have to tell them something important then, this can be very frustating. The internet makes talking to your friends a whole lot easier. You can type up an email to a friend you haven't talked to in a few months. You can also chat with your friends who are on the same time you are. Most internet chatting is free, so you can stay on as long as you want and not even worry about running up your bill. Several people I know use their computers to keep them entertained. When your friends are busy and there's nothing on @CAPS1 you can always go on a game website. Many stores, such as @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 sell games you can download onto your computer as well. You can also listen to your favorite bands and discover new ones on the internet. Websites like @CAPS4 and let people watch showa from their computer that they either missed or just want to watch again. Many people are surprised when they find out computers. Whenever students have to do a research paper, the number are resource they use is @ORGANIZATION2. If people want to learn more about something on their own, The internet is a quick and simple way to do it. Instead of going to the library to take out a look, why not hop on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 to help you with your report. Many @CAPS7 school graduates take college courses online too.Clearly, a computer is a piece of tachnology everyone can enjoy. It provides an easy way to talk to your family and friends. It puts a little fun into our lives. If you want to research anything from a vacation spot to your favorite celebrity a computer can help you. Computers really are an incredible invention.",9
2323,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 people believe computers have a positive effect while @CAPS1 believe they have a negative effect. Copmuters help keep distant friends and fmaily in touch. They help save time and money for parents of bored children or lazy family members. Lastly @CAPS1 jobs and kids school careers would be different without computers. Computers have a larg, good impact on our society. Remember your best friends from college or that boy from @CAPS2 you were always to talk to! Well now with the advancements in computers you can reconnect with lost friends or distant relative. One very popular way to keep in touch is facebook, where you can serach old friends or family. In the news @CAPS3 there was an article about a @NUM1 year old girl found her father after @NUM2 years. It turned out he had been looking for her too and she visits himevery weekend. Another way to keep in touch using the computer is instant messaging or email where you can talk by typing and sending messages to each other and pictures can be sent via email to people all over the world. A last way family and friends can stay in touch is with skype which is a database you can video chat with anyone who has this sysytem downloaded on their computer. Computers not only keep people in touch they also help save time and money. Its six o'clock on @DATE1 @TIME1 and you have nothing to eat and your spouse your car. What are you going to do? Now with computers you can order to go food online or which is a service provided by stop and shop which grocery shops and delivers your food to you. Also if you need a new appliance, shoes, clothes, or what ever you @MONTH1 need you can buy it online at stores and it will be delivered for you saving you time and gas money. Lastly, you @CAPS5't have to pay for gas or arcade fees for your kids anymore because there are wide varities of games online. On good mornign @CAPS4 they interviewed a @NUM3 year old boy who had never been to an arcade and had no desire too because he could play games online. When you are done playing games you can stay at your computer and work. Amny jobs today could not be done if there weren't computers. if you stay at home or go to an office building for work you are sure to use a computer in some way to get your assignment done. Also advirtismnet companies are almost completely run off computers when you are on a site and there is a flashing box the say ""You @CAPS5!"" that is an advirtisment. Another group comuters help are students. Students can use online textbooks or get their home work assignments. For example there is a high school in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 that n o longer has textnooks fro students to bring home. The students all have laptop computers for textbooks typing assignments and other homework. Computers help get jobs done. Computers have a great impact on our society today. They help families and friends keep in touch. They save @CAPS1 people time, money and effort. Lastly, computers help students and the working class get jobs done. Computers have a good effect on people today. ",10
2324,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I have been hearing about people fighting over computers and if they are or are not good for our us. But I do have to say that I think they are good. One @ORGANIZATION1 the reasons why I say this is because it will allows you to talk to friends and family that are away or they can even be accross the street. @CAPS7 over all it's a great way to keep in touch with people. It also helps kids with school work. For example you @MONTH1 find games that will help you in @CAPS2 ever class you need or you can find information on certain things that you need to know for projects. The last idea I can come up with is that you can pay your bills online. You @MONTH1 not think this is a big topic but it is. Say if you have a bill that due tomorrow you can get emails stating that you have a bill due tommorrow and how much you need to pay. @CAPS7 these are my reasons for agreeing with the fact that computers are good for us. Alright, lets get started. My first reason for thinking that computers are good for us is that you can stay in touch with people such as your friends and family. But although there is the risk @ORGANIZATION1 people talking to strangers but that is their @CAPS2 I mom by that that they mine a stupid choice and they face the consiquences. But other than that most people do the smart thing and talk to the friends @ORGANIZATION1 family @CAPS3 or @CAPS4-@CAPS5 theres just a great @ORGANIZATION1 things you can do to stay in touch with friends and family. @CAPS7 I hope you are starting to think about the good things computers do for us. Well @CAPS10 it is time to tell you my @NUM1 reason for thinking computers are for us. This topic is school working is almost every class room you walk into there is a computer. The computers really help got school work They canprovide information on projects or even provide little games for extra help and I bet @NUM2 out @NUM2 students would agree with me. For example I just had a project on the ""@CAPS6 @NUM4's"" and I used my computer to find information about @CAPS7 it I can use the @CAPS8 for school work you can to. Alright @CAPS10 to start off my third reason for thinking @CAPS8's are good for us heres a quote from @PERSON1. ""@CAPS10 that we have had @CAPS7 many advances in technology it is @CAPS7 much easier to pay your bills online."" @PERSON2 is the top guy at @ORGANIZATION1 and he even thinks that paying bills online is a great help too. Plus if you forget about a bill they will send a to your @CAPS4-@CAPS5 or even give you a call. I even think it is easy. I watch my mom pay her bills and it is just click click done. This is my final reason for thinking that computers are good for us. @CAPS10 that you have heard my ideas I hope you join me and the other @NUM5 million people that think computers. But these three topics I just wrote about are only same @ORGANIZATION1 the things that computer makes easier. There are just @CAPS7 many things you can do on the computer. @CAPS7 I hope you agree with me. But I hope you remember the computer is as easy as a click @ORGANIZATION1 a botton.",10
2325,"It has come to my @CAPS1 that not everyone agress that computers benift society which I @MONTH1 add I dont think they do! In the past @PERCENT2 of people who have lived in the past days want say what they say now. My first resson is because kids who have bad health and there on computers there not doing any good for them selves either than becoming a couch potato playing computer games. But I play on computers but I still get the exercise I need to get and I like to be active. I think they should just stop selling computers cause they went get any where in life just sittin around playing world of worcraft all day. Secondly, the time it must take to download stuff thats the time you could be taken to go run a mile but I dont know. Thats your gugs porogaitive. Dr. @PERSON1 from the brain clinic on computers has stayted more than @PERCENT1 of people who have computers tend to stop doing there social activities and foucus more on video games and not there school work. If I was a parent I would through the computer out the window. In conclusion I dont I think its a good benifit in society to have computers. I urge you to change what you half to do in order to change this society to be better and healthyer thoun it is right now. Well desion is up to you.",8
2326,"I think that computers doesn't benefits society. I agree with that because people send too much time on the computers, talk to people they don't know and watch things they souldn't be watching. One reson I think that computers don't benefit us is people send too much time on it. I use to be on the computers all the time, but when @DATE1 came and my family went on a trip, I saw what I became without a computer around. I also saw that I was pulling myself away from my family, so I said that I will not go on the computer for a long time. So now, I hang with my family more, then if I want to, I go on the computer for @NUM1 min. (but most of the time I don't) But as you can see, I almost lost myself to the computer and that is way I don't think computers benefits us. Reson two I think that computer don't help us is you could be talking to someone you think you know, but don't. You can be a teen on the computer talking to your ""friend"" when your ""friend"" is @NUM2 years old. You put and show stuff that will get some old guy to want you, and he or she will pull the information out of you if you let them it out. They can ask you stuff that will help them find you and you wouldn't know. That is another reson I belevae that computers do not benefits you. The last reson I belevae computers are not benefits is kid and teens will watch stuff they souldn't be on it. I have a friend, fath, and she was so good, but then she move away and I didn't see her for two yaers. When she move back she change and she said because she saw stuff on the computer, everthing changed for the way she see things. I didn't want to be friends with her anymore because of what she saw, on the computer. Also, my cuosin's friend does the same thing and got my doing it so I don't talk to her any more. See what the computer does to people. That is why I think the computer does not help us, because it get you to slit you and your family, talk to people you don't know, and watch things that you souldn't watch.",7
2327,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, although use on @CAPS1, I still believe the computer has a positive effect on society. The computer helps our society with a lot of things, like learning, to talk to far away reletives, and it also helps school with the different programs for teaching. I know some people say people are spending too much time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends. Lets talk about learning. The computers helps kids learn hand-eye coordination which could help in sports and other activities. It also lets you learn about far away places today not a few years ago like in books. It teaches responsibility also by letting kids chose betwee the good and the bad websites. Having a computer also allows you to talk to people wich is a good thing because some people have faraway reletives that they dont talk to on the phone often. It lets you talk to close friends if you dont have a phone. It also lets you to communicate with long distant friends. The computer helps with teaching too. For example, teachers use @ORGANIZATION2 word to create their notes. The computer is hoolsed up to smart board wich is constantly used. Teachers base a lot of activities for the use of the computer. The teachers assign students projects that must be done by a computer. The computer as you see has a lot of positive affects on society, which is a good thing.",8
2328,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In these few years, technolgy is more edvanced than ever. That means more and more people are using computers all the time. Some people thought that using computer is not a good idea. But I believe in an other theory, and there is lots of great things computer brought us in our live. Use of computer teaches hand-eye coordination, give the ability to learn more, and allow people to talk with others. The hand-eye coordination really helps people in daily lives. First, all jobs today are all revolding around computers. @CAPS6, having a sence of using a computer is needed in order for people to get a job. In fact, high school are having classes to teach student about and how to use the computer. In class, the teachers teachs hand-eye coordination that allows the students to type faster. As one of my teacher back in @NUM1 grade said, ""@CAPS1 I was in high school, people pays me to type for them!"" @CAPS2 that we can see that person is having lack of hand-eye coordination which forced him to pay some one else to type his papers. If that person has proper hand-eye coordination in order to type fast, he might have a better job that what he had now. Computer also allows people to learn more. Secondly, computer give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. Last marking periode, I did a project on the top @NUM2 @CAPS3 countries to go for vacation in. Without computer, I wouldn't be able to know the facts about these countries and finish my project. Computers has websites you can search anything you want. For example, @PERCENT1 of people in a company is searching stuff about other people. That other people might be their customers or, and these informations they got will help them get the bussiness case easier. In addition, people came up with websites that allows you to talk with others @CAPS2 far away. @CAPS4, a website where everyone in the world can join to talk and chat with friends or others. I guss you have an account on @CAPS4 just like me or your friends. As a research shows @PERCENT2 of junior high and senior high students goes home and the first thing that do after turning on the computers is loging on to @CAPS4 to see if their friends are on. I, personal, moved for an other country to @LOCATION1 @CAPS6, there are families of mine in my home country. The internet on the computer allowed me to talk to them on a webcam. Without computer my life will have a hole in it, because I won't know how my family is doing. I think that everyone who came @CAPS2 or other country think the same way as I do. In conclusion, using a computer is not a bad idea. It proves people hand-eye coordination, to learn more about faraway places, and talk to others faraway easily. If there was no computer, there won't be a @NUM3 centery as we called it. So, the using of computer is a wonderful thing.",10
2329,"I think that computers are good because you can communicate with family and friends trough a webcam or other local websites such as myspace, twitter, and facebook and also to play games and watch funny videos. But also we learn from the incyclopidia and google and other websites to get an education computers are helpful to us and we need computers because without them how are our young ones going to learn how to use computers. Also with out computers we cant know how are family and friends are doing and because we have computers dosn't mean that we can not use them. My father always told me he never went to school or college and he never got an education or how to use computers. thats why he wants me to use computers because he wants me to teach him how to use computers. Computers are helpful and we cant get an education without them yea we have teachers and they can give us an education but not as much as computers because technology is important to us. Also how are homeless people going to learn to use computers. Also how are people that didn't go to school are going to learn how to use computers.",7
2330,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that the computer companies think that people spend too much time on them? They also say we use computers so much, that we don's get any exersize? Basicly, the companies dont think that people should use computers. I disagree with this very much. I disagree eith this because people can exersize when ever they want to, people need computers for work/school, and if you don't have any kind of phone, you need to @CAPS3-mail them or talk to them on @ORGANIZATION1. My first reason why I dissagree with the computer companies is that people can go out and exersize when ever they want. Most people don't sit in front of the computer all day. They will get up and exersize around the block, or on a work out machine. If people do not exercize and do not get off the computer then they are wrong. People can make their own decision. My second reaon why I disagree with the computer companies is because people need computers for work and school. Kids and adults get a lot of projects these days. When they do get assigned one they most likely will need to type it up. Also, people with projects might need to get information on a famous person, and yes i know that that is what books are for , and if they dont have that person, then they need the computer. The computer is handy for prodjects and essays. My final reason why I disagree with the computer companies is if you don't have a phone and need to talk to them, you need the computer to @CAPS3-mail or talk to them on @ORGANIZATION1. If we didnt have the computers, and someone didnt have a phone, then they would not be able to tell them what they need to tell them. What if it was important? Or an emergency? The would never know... In conclution, The computer companies think that we dont need computers, and don't get enough exersize. I think they want, people need them for work/school projects, and because if you dont have a phone, then you need to @CAPS3-mail or talk to them on @ORGANIZATION1. You need to wake up and realize we need computers. You need to keep computers in this world! ",9
2331,"Dear Experts, I completaly agree with your idea that people should get out more and enjoy nature istead of being glued to a computer screen. I will be listing three reasons why people should not be attached to a computer. I hope you will understand my reasons. Computer screen damage your eyes by @PERCENT1! @CAPS2 example my eyes start to hurt whenever I stare at any kind of screen. And I work at the @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 so I can get away from the harmful screen. When you finally understant and knew your computer like your best friend, @CAPS1!!! It becomes your new best friend. You will never want to go to the outside world and become a lonely in never seeing anybody and the . I have gone to the trouble of interviewing his life. He said, ""first I woke up to find my on the keyboard and leaning of to my left and to my right at ,"" @CAPS2 breakfast he finishes his ""computer."" You don't see computer all day?!? Why are you! And example with my work at the @ORGANIZATION2 (@ORGANIZATION1) is that I get to get out of the house and have fun. Third people who stay at home with no friends and are studying, @CAPS2 example @CAPS3, never find out about nature. I exremely love my job because I got to be with nature Nature I feed the animals and get to go outside and admire the beauty of the world. @CAPS2 the computer! new you know my reasons and I with had I write. I agree with your statements like many others and I hope I can help you put it into action.",7
2332,"There has been an arguement that people spend more time on the computer instead of being outside. I disagree because most people don't own computers, also, two out of three people prefer spending time with friends, and if people do own a computer they are mostly for business purposes. Yes, computers do give people the ability to learn about far away places and they do teach hand-eye coordination, but that's not all they've good for. Some parents don't allow their children to own laptops or computers because of online chatting, inappropriate games, or inappropriate photos/videos. On that note, children are able to play outside get exercise, hang with friends, go to special events, etc. The parents are preventing their children from harm, inappropriate behavior/language, and from being lazy. The parents are realrcing the dangers of the internet. Would you rather sit a home staring at a bright screen or go to the mall, park, or basketball game with your friends? In fact, two out of three people would rather be with their friends. Some reasons you should be with your friends is you won't miss out on the latest gossip or the jokes that would only be funny if you were there. I could go on and on with a list of reasons why you should be with your friends and family instead of wasting your life on the computer for hours. Your friends need you now, your computer is always going to be there, but not your friends. The computer is also used for business purposes as well. There are jobs where people have to write long papers. So, the computer helps people become successful. I highly doubt people who own computers waste their vauluable time playing internet games rather than exercising with sports. Besides, who wouldn't want to take a break from the computer after writing along paper and staring at a screen for hours. I think I have made my opinion clear that people don't waste their time on computers. I think people understand that friends and family are more important than a computer. Also, if experts believe we are wasting out time on computers, then stop giving school technology privalages to have laptops and palm pilots.",9
2333,"Dear @CAPS1, I feel that computers have a negative effect on the population. You can do different things becide using the computer to acheve ""hand eye"" corrdination, talk to people in different ways, and gain information other than looking it up online. First of all, there are other ways to get ""hand eye"" corrdination besides playing on the computer. Playing sports such as fencing or baseketball can help you. Fencing is not just stabbing each other with sticks, it takes a great deal of mental focus and hand corrdination. Bascketball makes you work with your hands and feet all at the same time. It also teaches you teamwork which can come in very handy in the buisiness world. Next, while doing these activities you get fit. A computer does not strengthen you musles, besides finger musles, but excersise does. Playing sports is a great way to do it, expessally if you enjoy doing it. Even taking a musical instrument will help you gain ""hand eye"" corrdination. Playing the piano, for example will help your corrdination. After you active great ""hand eye"" corrdination, try doing other activities that help you set your next goal. In conclusion, while playing on a computer will allow you to get ""hand eye"" corrdination, doing a sport or playing an instrument wil help you more. To continue, some people think that the only way to talk to your friend is on a computer but it is not. To begin, there is a machine called a phone you could use. It is a better way to go because you can do something else while talking like gardening or looking. Also, letters can be usful, too. You might not be able to have a conversation but you can enjoy knowing how someone is doing like if they are on vacation. Finnally, it is the one thing I think most people today have forgoten is talking to someone in the same room. People have been doing this since the of man. Not talking over the phone or texting or email. Just looking at each other and talking at them, not in a phone or over a text message. To summerize, there are a lot of ways to talk to another person without using a computer. Finally, if we want to know something, we do not have to go emeditly go to the computer. The library is a great place to go and you might find a book there that you might to want to read. Libraries are one of the least visited spots in the @LOCATION1. Since you can look up anything online people have completly forgotten it. There is also a school. Teachers love to help people learn about things because that is there job. Finally, there are your parents. They know it all because they learned about it, too and love to bring it back to their mind. To conclude, more and more people each day turn to the internet to know things but there are places and people that know it, too. To wrap it up, computers effect on people is a negative relationship. People believe the only way to get ""hand eye"" corrdination is through the computer but there are other ways to do it, also if you want talk to someone you need to do it online and finally, information can not only be found online but, in places like the library. This is why I feel the the hold computers have on people is a negative one.",9
2334,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 waster your free time, on a beautiful, sunny day, in front of computer screen? In reality, computers don't have a positive effect on people. Instead of spending time outside or exersizing, @CAPS2 stay indoors at the computer. Also @CAPS2 lose sight of important things like spending time with friends and family, and @CAPS2 have pretty much lost face to face communication. @CAPS2 need to start going back to the times where @CAPS2 didn't worry about the computers and get back to worrying about the important things. Instead of spending time outside and exersizing, poeple just sit at heir computer. People blame @ORGANIZATION1 and other fast food placs for obesity, but computers can take the blame too. @CAPS2 forget to go the park and jog, but yet @CAPS2 remember to check our email for the fifth time. I'm sure there are people who do get to the gym and still spend time at the computer, but then there are the majority who don't. Computers take away the aspect of playing outside or exersizing at the gym and @CAPS2 need to start getting back to that. Secondly, @CAPS2 lose sight of the important things like spending time with friends and family. ""@CAPS2 forget about going to @LOCATION1's for dinner or having our friends sleepover,"" says one scientist. @CAPS2 are so worried about missing out on a chance to @CAPS3 someone that @CAPS2 don't go play catch with our brothers and sisters. @CAPS2 forget to make dinner once in a while to give our parents a break @CAPS2 need to start worrying about who and what is really important in our lives, and not the next new way to talk to our friends. Lastly, @CAPS2 have really lost face to face communication @CAPS2 don't worry about meeting with our friends to catch up, @CAPS2 just talk with them in a chatroom. Think about the best friend you haven't seen in @NUM1 years wouldn't you rather see them again, than type the words you want to say? Teenagers how-a-days just open up their cell-phone and send a text message to say""hi"" or they just open up facebook on their computer and chat with someone. @CAPS2 need to step away from the computer and step back into reality. I see how someone might say ""But it's just easier. You have a barrier in front of you and you don't have to worry about messing up."" But really they are jsut saying that whatever they are saying is not something to be said in person, so they shouldn't be saying it all. I think that @CAPS2 should all step back and think about how computers have taken over our lives. Instead of going to the gym @CAPS2 sit at the computer, @CAPS2 forget about what is really important, and, also, @CAPS2 have lost face to face communication. @CAPS2 need to get a hold of ourselves and start thinking about how computers really effect our lives. I really think @CAPS2 should step away from the computer and in step into a pair of running shoes and go for a jog.",10
2335,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I do not think computers are having a good effect on our society. They are not improving the health of the users, in fact, it is quite unhealthy, the users can't enjoy real life, and they spend less time interacting with real people. I know by the end of this letter you will agree with me. Over using computers is very unhealthy. @CAPS4 using a computer, time escapes from people, and the spend MUCH less time exercising. Doctor @ORGANIZATION1 says ""@CAPS4 watching @CAPS5 or using a computer people just keep eating if there is a bag of food in front of them, even if they are already full, it is one of the leading reasons for obesety"", @CAPS6 you can see, using a computer is a lot less healthy than it seems. Another problem with using a computer is that people don't enjoy real life. The user gets caught up in a vertual world that isn't even real. The real senery of outside isn't seen, wich can make people unhappy, and they don't know why. Also, @NUM1 people can get extremely caught up in virtual games, and forget about real life alltogether. Scientist @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS7 computer games can lead to depressionbecause the user doesn't get involved in real life, wich can lead to depression without then knowing it."" Computers aren't looking so good now, are they? Last, but ceartanly not least, using the computer causes the user to spend less time interacting with real people. People who think computers are improving our society say that you can talk to people online, but truthfully, it is not the same. People don't build social skills from talking online, wich can seriously damage children's entire life. Also, little kids are actting too atached to the computer, they come hom, and get on the computer. This causes childrens social lifes to be deprived. Computers are taking kids lives away. @CAPS6 you can see, computers are not @CAPS6 harmless @CAPS6 they seem at first glance. They are very unhealthy, restrict the user from enjoying real life, and the user spends less time interacting with real people. We need to find a way to stop this before it becomes a bigger problem than it already is!",9
2336,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, With the wave of technology that comes with the twenty first century, computers have been a huge success. Almost everyone uses them reguarly, but are they really helping or hurting the ones that use them? Computers are not a nessesary part of life, and it would be benifical to all if we cut down on their use. Did you know that more than half the people in @LOCATION1 are overweight? With the oncoming swell of technology something else has been coming ur right behind it, @CAPS1. More and more people are becoming overweight because of their lack of exercise, and healthy eating. According to the editor in @CAPS2 magazine @PERCENT1 of people who use computers for more than half an hour a day are more overweight than the people who use them less. But the sad thing is, that most peole don't even realize they're being sucked in by their computer. As their local newspaper, it is up to you to tell the people about the dangers of overuse of their computers. Computers are also living people away from the outside world. When go to the mall with your friend if you can just order the same stuff online? Why go to the movies with your family when you can watch the same thing on you tube few free? People are thinking like this and they probably don't even realize it! Friends and family members can also talk to you on the computer with just a press of a button. This over extensive use of this electronic can not be healthy for people. Humans are ment to intract with each other, not sit in a house all day! It has also been proven that harrasment levels have gone up since the invention of the computer. This electronic makes it easy for people to bully other people online. This is espesially present among young adults, with the ever popular myspace and facebook.! A few taps on the keys and a mouse click, thats how easy it could be to bully someone online. Even if you wanted justice cyber bullres can make their identities unknown online. Bullying can make someone lose their confedince and self-esteem, which is never good for kids at such a young age. While computers can sometimes make our everyday lives easier, it is evident that they do more harm than good. They are the causes of weight gain in some people, the cause of bullying in another, and can even pull people away from their family's. It would benefit everyone if we cut down on there use",8
2338,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I for one believe that computers do benefit people. They help people live their daily lives, they help society learn, and they help people interact together. If I didn't have a computer I couldn't chat with my friends or check the weather. The computer can be addicting but you choose how much you use it. This why I believe computers are a benefit to the @CAPS6. People rely on computers everyday for their daily lives. People use the computer for checking their email and for writing letters and papers. The computer helps us with @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 @CAPS7 we can writing things and make backup coies incase it gets lost. Were suposed to go forward in life and invent @CAPS1 things. Were not suposed to go backwards to writing draft after on parchment with a bottle of ink and. That is why I believe we should use computer to benefit our daily life. My second reason that computers are a benefit is because they help us learn. Whenever there is a @CAPS4 that I don't know I go to @CAPS5 to look it up. I know I can use a dictionary but the computer saves me time and energy. The computer also has @CAPS6 news that you learn about and it has more than just two peoples points, it has all the points from the people who rare what they think they should do. In general if you want to find a product you google it, or I do, @CAPS7 you get a ton of results and they can lead you to other things too. That is why I believe computers benefit you in learning. Computers have a third benefit, which is they help you interact with your friends and peers. If your friend is sick and has the flu you can chat him online or do a wedchat to tell him something. It benefits both of you because you friend gets to talk to you and you don't get sick. If you have a friend in another state or another country then you can chat with them. If you send letters it'll be to slow. Whenn you chat with others like on @CAPS8 you can meet @CAPS1 people who like the same things as you. This why computers are beneficial to people. As I've said before computers are beneficial because they help people with their daily lives, they help society learn as a whole, and they help people interact together. These are the reasons ehy I believe computers are beneficial to people. You said that people need to get exercise instead of spending time on a computer. What are you going to say next you want a on cars.",10
2339,"Have you ever imagined people around the world spending too much time in the computer and not being able to enjoy life? In my opinion people should spend less time in computers. Computers is a great distraction for people, especially kids. People should spend less time in computers and more time doing other things like for example spending more time with their family, exercising, and doing their work. @CAPS1 people do all of this things they will become more responsible and enjoy life. My first reason why people should spend less time in computers and more time with their family is because they will be better persons. A phycologist once sayd ""@CAPS1 a children spends time with their family then there is an enormous chance that that person will become someone in the future."" Spending time with your family is really important because you feel that you're loved and that your family cares for you. Doctors have found that when people grow up with a strong connection between them and their family, it make life easier for that person. Therefore @CAPS1 you spend more time with your family you will accomplish all of these things. My second reason why people should spend less time in computers and more time exercising is because you will decrease your chances of death. Researchers have found that @CAPS1 you exercise @NUM1 hour a day everyday day you will decrease your chances of death. Eexacising will not just decrease the chances of death, it will also make you look better physically. In addition you will also be healthier. I implore you to start exercising so that way you will have a long period of life. @CAPS1 you start exercising you will be able to of this things. My third reason why people should spend less time in computers and more time doing their work is because it will help them improve their grades. I have seen people spending more time in computers and less time doing work. The board of education have researched that @CAPS1 a student spends more time doing their work and less time in computers then their grades will increase by a lot. spending more time on your work will increase a students having capability. Teachers say that @PERCENT1 of the students who do their work have A and @CAPS2 in their classes. The other @PERCENT1 of the students have @CAPS3 and @CAPS2. @CAPS1 you start doing your work then your grades will definetly increase. @CAPS1 you want to accomplish all of these things then you have to spend less time in computers. Computers is the number @NUM1 distraction for all the people around the world. I implore you to spend less time in computers and more time with your family, exercising, and doing your work. @CAPS1 you try all these things I assure you that you will be able to accomplish them yet you will became a responsible and a better person.",11
2340,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 was you life like before there were the of advances in technology that we have today? Can you sincerely say that your personal and career life has become more efficient? Well, this is indeed because of computers. I believe that computers are the reason why our society has grown today, therefore I strongly feel opinionated that computers have positive effect on people. One reason that I think computers have a positive effect is because it allows you to be educated on news and certain topics rapidly. The next reason is because they allows you to communicate with others instantly. Lastly, computers have a positive effect on the environment. Imagine yourself living before the @DATE1. Think about @CAPS13 you would feel if you heard about a product that brought you into a separate world; a world where you could find anything out all in the comforts of your home. That world, writers at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, is the world wide web. The internet allows you to seek information from your own home, without making visit to the library! Also, if you forget to pick up daily newspaper or your magazine, don't worry because you can likely find coverage of that article online. Nowadays with parents walking around to try to get through the recession, children don't have the ability to get a ride to the back a library @CAPS8, no worries because your can read articles and discover it online. And even shop! @CAPS9 proven by these computers are a positive effect on humans for the reasons allowing this to live their but in a more orderly and the next reason why I strongly support the opinion that computers have a positive effect on people is because it allows all people to communicate with other @CAPS9 of today there are social networking @CAPS10 @CAPS11, iChat, and @CAPS12 a @PERCENT1 of people said that they these application of that @PERCENT1, @PERCENT2 said their lives has change for they can even take to in other of the and their bills have goo down! You know the communication They when it comes to computer @CAPS13 many times a day do you yourself observe or overhear people talking about being agreed! Surprisingly, an easy way to obtain a main goal in life to be green is owning a computers with email accounts accesable to the majority of @CAPS14, there is no need to use paper any larger. When you'd like to spread news it is common now for people to use email instead of making flyers out of paper. Also, I have heard about many newspapers going online so they don't waste paper by printing the news. Another example are students simply emailing their teachers their papers, instead of printing them. All in al I hope you see my points save the trees and go buy a computer, because computers not only make a positive effect on people, but also the environment. Computers, experts say, are the advance of the generation. Is this good or is it bad? You @MONTH1 asks. I clearly stated that I believe computers do in fact have a positive effect on people. One reason is because they educate you and allow you to recieve information on news much quicker. Next, they supply on accessable way to communicate. Lastly, they make for an better environment. I trust that you will make the right decision, fellow computer users, while forming your opinion.",10
2341,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever thought of how hard it would be to publish newspapers without computers? I have, and having to write hundreds of papers daily can be a pain. Computers have made our lives safer and more interesting. Our country's @CAPS16 is based on computers. I understand that people are becoming lazy and unhealthy because of this, but advances in technology positioned the @LOCATION1 as one of the most powerful countries in the world. The richest man in the world is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5, or @CAPS3 @CAPS4. He is famous for @ORGANIZATION2, a company that makes computers and computer platforms, like @CAPS8 @NUM1 and @CAPS8 @CAPS10. But why is he rich? Because people need computers. People need to communicate with each other. I myself know a lot more about computers than most people I know. This is because my father is a computer engineer. I know that computers can do things we can only imagine. We can find cures for diseases, like @CAPS11, @CAPS12 and diabetes. Yes, Computers might take away time that should be spent outside, playing a sport or watching nature. Some people might just turn on the @CAPS13.V to the @ORGANIZATION1, or play sports on their @CAPS14 @NUM2. That's too far, substituting exercise of your body for exercising your thumbs. But many jobs, @CAPS15 systems, and @CAPS16 systems depend on computers to work. Computers are very important to this world. I agree we are too dependant on computers, but if you are using computers for a good reason, there is no reason you shouldn'@CAPS13 use it. Everyone uses something related to computers atleast once a day.",8
2342,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 opinion is that computers should only be used for a little while, use when nessacary, or to exersice a lot if you want to stay on the computer a lot. First of all I say stay on the computer for a little while because if you stay on too long your eyes will get bloodshot, no time with family, and only stay on a bit if your playing a game. Only use when nessacary such as doing homework or looking up information, or just want to import save photos. Games are fine but not too much. And if you're a person that hes to stay on the computer for work or something, you must exercise, to stay on a lot. I say this because if you @CAPS4't exercise and you stay on a lot, it wont benefit you in any way, you will have bad health, and it will be hard to work in an office, if you @CAPS4't exercise. This is why I say ""@CAPS4't stay on the computer a lot. Only for a little while, use when nessacary, and, you must exercise if you do stay on a lot. You should agree with me too.",6
2343,"Dear, local Newspaper I belive that we should advance in technology because I think computers have a positive effect on people. It allows people to talk online with other people, they teach hand-eye coordination, and it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. @PERCENT1 of the world thinks that talking online is better than talking on the phone. And you can set up a web cam so when it's not nice out side you can hook up your web cam and talk see each other with out leaving the house. If you dont have a phone you can go on you computer and email each other save you money to. My @CAPS1 will said when he had a computer it tought him good hand eye coordination but now that he dose not have a computer he lost that coordination. @PERCENT2 of the population of amaricans said with out hand I coordination. It gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. like me I found my true love on the internet. More people find there lover's on the online chat room. Would you rather find you wife online then in person I wouldn't. It is a better experense. And you @MONTH1 be able to look a job on @ORGANIZATION1. I have a possitive effect on this letter.",7
2344,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In the question if technology is bad or good, I believe it is causing more harm then good. This is because I think people are spending more time with computer then necessary. Here are some examples. The more time people are on computer the less socially interactive they become. For example, if a computer dominates your job, you can be missing time with co-workers. Also if childs life is dominated by computers it can be bad for their future. If a child doesn't make friends it's ok, but if doesn't learn how he could be in trouble. For instance, if a child spent most of their time on computers and don't learn to make friends when they are older they will have no one to rely on so they could become depress in their lonely world. Also they could become obese. This could happen if a child spent time on a computer not exercising they will just gain pounds which is bad for there future. If this cycle develops and then progressed our comunity could be very bad because we could turn into fat socially people. An addiction to computers could easily be developed because when you spend a lot of time on it you could become addicted to it. This would be bad because you would spend all your time on it apart from everything. Within this addiction you could develope many bad things. For starte is you probably would damage your eyes, and or everything I've talked about before, (obesity, depression, no friends) The final way that the computer is bad is because it prevents you from living a good life. For example if you developed any circumtance that I stated before you probably would be unhappy. Happines is one of the few qualities that makes life bearable. In my life I also think that sports and family are important so once again if you developed any of my previous examples it would be hard to communicate with a family or participate in sports!. As you can see computers are not helpful for any society.",8
2345,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have a negative effect on people such as being unhealthy, not enjoying the world, and spending time with family. My first reason why going on the @CAPS7 is a negative effect be because it is unhealthy. Would you rather stay in the house all day and never get an excercise? If you are on the @CAPS7 all day, you most likely are going to gain weight because you have to eat. Now you know why the @CAPS7 can make you unhealty. My next reason why the @CAPS7 is a negative effect is you won't be able to enjoy the world. You be so cought up with the @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5 that you won't have any time for yourself. I remember watching a show and the lady was on the @CAPS7 so much that she was scared to go outside. So. i think it is very important to enjoy world other than the @CAPS7. My last reason why computers have such a negative effect on people is because, people won't spend enough time with family. Many people won't spend time with there family because they are so obsessed with there new computers. My mom always says / ""@CAPS6 if it is the last time you seen me"". @CAPS6 if it was the last time you see your family? Would you rather stay home with your @CAPS7? or spend time with your family? now you know my final reason why computers are a negative effect. As you can see, Computers are a negative effect because, they are unhealthy, you won't have time to explore thw world, and you won't spend a lot of time with your family.",7
2346,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 is bliss. Computers give this to us and more. They give us useful skills, we get so much of our @CAPS1 from computers, and it helps us in our everyday life. Computers are very much a positive in our lives. We get so many useful skills from computers such as, hand-eye coordination. They're so many programs to help people read, write better, learn different languages and the list goes on. In fact, many people take online student classes for high school or college. This is very helpful for people who have kids, jobs or money problems. Computers gives us important @CAPS1. We have so much technology helping dotors and researchers find cures to harmful illnesses. Moreover, without computers it would make it hard to help cure people with illnesses. Schools everywhere in the world use computers because kids learn so much more at a faster rate, About @PERCENT1 of students who use computers for learning go to college.

2347,"Dear Local Newspaper, More and more of my friends are beginning to use computers, and while many of them think it is beneficial and needed. I think it does not help society and can be a disdvantage to people in the modern day. For example, the computers people use are very time consuming and while they are the computers they are missing out on the opprtunity to play and get fresh air. Also, even though computers chane communication websites, you can't communicate face to face which is a needed skill when people are looking for jobs and when people are on computers they are missing out on enjoying nature. First off, everyone in the world needs exercise and it is what keeps them in shape that if people don't get at least on hour of excercise a day they can become overweight and get sick. If people are on computers @CAPS1 the time and everyday they will have no time for excercise and they will be in more danger of being sick or overwieght. Even though the computers is an advance piece of technology, you cant get your daily excercise from it, you need to actually, take the time and go outside to get thee excercise you need. Also a way people can get excercise is by playing sports. Sports because it doesn't only a way to get to know people, make new friends, and find your hidden talents. It is that @PERCENT1 people who play sports find what they want to do when they ate they finsl and know then what @CAPS1 in @CAPS1, I think that because people use not getting enough exercise. It is proven that the number one thing that people need as a skill when going for a job is communication skills and that will be hard to achieve if everyone is changing to communicate online because it is not the. For example, many jobs in the modern day need interactions between people and its is hard to interact with people. If you dont di it regularly. @CAPS1 in @CAPS1 , I think computers are hurting society because people are not communicating face to face. Lastly, I think computers are non- benifical because while people are wasting time on the computer they are not enjoying the nature and the things around them. They are @CAPS1 too focused on the computers screen, not on the beauty of natures brings everyone. It is proven that @PERCENT2 pf people who enjoy nature are more happy and are not as depressed as others. @CAPS1 in @CAPS1, I think that computers are wasting society because people are not getting fresh air and enjoying nature. In conclusion, the computers in our modern day can be very benefical because of the things it can do, but it is not as important as other things in our world.",10
2348,"I walked into the computer lab at school, and I saw all my classmates doing research for a project on the internet. I thought about how. I wouldn't even know how to do research for a project without the extremely convenient and easy internet. I think the efffects that computers have on us are not very good. Because of computers, we have cyber bullying I read an article about a girl named @PERSON1 who get cyber bullyed. @PERSON1 was on @CAPS1, a social networking site, and she get chated by these ""popular"" girls at school. The girls started making fun of her and saying lots of mean things to her. This continued happening for and finally. @PERSON1 got so fed up and started to believe the terrible things the girls said. @PERSON1 comitted suicide because of what these girls said. Those girls would never said than false things to @PERSON1's face. But they had the courage when they were able to hide behind their computer screens. @CAPS2 it for those effects that have, people would not be getting increased and bullyed over the internet. When people spent so much to not. There is this boy, in my class whos all of his going into the computer all of the he plays daily. He and therefore, he is overweight. @CAPS2 he didn't the computer as a I think get outside and some real games instead of th that he gets no out of. Computers in our society are a big of obesity in @LOCATION1. Children do not know how to do research without the internet. The first thing I think of when my teachers give me projects that require research is 'what website should I go on?' or 'I hope good sources come up on @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS2 I had to do all of my research by going to the library and looking thrugh books. I wouldn't know where to start. When we are given a resource such as the computer, people take advantage of it and don't know how to live without it. I think kids should learn how to use other resources (like books) instead of always relying on the internet. When I think of all the things the computer can do, I'm amazed! But computers have not helped us. In fact, they have done the exact opposite; they have hurt us. There is no way of recovering from all of this damage computers have done; but we can take it one step at a time, decreasing some of the technology that, is poluting lives, health, and edjucation. Computers do not have a positive effect on people, but we, as a country can change that.",9
2349,"Dear readers, I’m sure almost everyone out there has a computer. I understand that some people are concerned about the amount of time the average american spends on the web, but the computer is the key to a learning experience. The computer teaches us things such as hand-eye coordination and now even how to read! They give information on other people, places and cultures. The computer even lets us communicate with others. The computer is a learning tool. When people use it they’re learning hand-eye coordination. That skill later helps them do things like sports. With the advances in technology, the computer is becoming more helpful. In some cases it is how people learn to read. So don’t you see, the computer is a great thing for people to use? Information is always needed. The web can show you about people, places and cultures. In school we use computers for reports and projects. It is the fastest and easiest way to find information. If computers weren’t used as much as they are, students could be failing school. Adults also use the computer. Some jobs even require adults to be on a computer all day. The computer is a necessity. Communication is most important I know that people are worried because of online predators, but if you are informed on how to protect yourself them, then it’s ok. If we used computers then how could we talk to relatives and friends in other places who don’t have? Intelligent parents are letting their kids use computers for hours. It lets them learn to comunicate with others. I agree that at some point everyone should go and exercise and enjoy nature, but that doesn't have to give up the computer. It teaches us hand-eye coordination and how to read. Also it gives us information about almost everything. And finally because it lets us comunicate with others.",8

Computers benefit people by letting them talk to family and friend. The benefit is that if you haven’t seen a family member in a long time, the computer lets you talk to them as much as you want. Another benefit is that if you just want to talk to them. Lastly is that if you need to talk to them and its very important that you talk to them. Computers benefit people in many ways. One way is that it helps you learn about things your interested in that helps you if you are interested in for example art. You can use the internet to research about art. Another thing is that if you are into other things the internet helps you learn about it. Computers benefit people in many ways.

2352,"The obesity level in the @LOCATION1 is rising rapidly. It has risen almost ten percent from last year. Today, computers are an enormous risk to both children and adults. Adults and children have started to @CAPS3 addicted by the computers. Computers have been affecting exercise time, family time, and knowledge. These are all negative consquences to both adults and children. A recent study has shown that more computers are being sold each year to both adults and children. Its great to @CAPS3 outside and enjoy the fresh air. Running around the fields playing tag, hide and seek, and frisbee are all fun activities you do outside. However, computers are starting to take this away from kids and adults. Everyday the obesity level is starting to rise. More and more kids are staying inside to go facebook, myspace, twitter, and to play games. These kids and adults come home from school or work and stay on the computer the rest of the @TIME1. Since their not exercising they are gaining wait. This is causing kids and adults to start going over weight and starting to reach obesity, when you exercise you feel good about yourself and when your obes you don't want to go out in public because of the way you look. Its fun to exercise with your friends. Join a team at school or @CAPS3 outside at least an hour a day. This will help you - stay in shape. If your having trouble losing wait watch your diet. Stay away from fatting foods like cheeseburgers, fries, and milkshakes. Make sure you eat fruits and vegetables. Spending time with your family is great. Watching the big game, playing outside, and talking are great ways to interact with your family. Now most kids dont even go downstairs to say ""hi"" because their to busy on the computer. While on the computer they miss out on having a couple laughs with the family. One day something might go wrong with a family. If you were on the computer you would feel guilty because you didn't even say hello to them. Its better to go downstairs and talk for a little, rather than hiding in your room playing on the computer. A recent study has been done at @ORGANIZATION1 saying that some kids don't even know who their @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 are. Spending hours and hours a day on the computer isn't doing anything good about your education. In fact, its making you even dumber. Spending countless hours on the computer isn't going to @CAPS3 you far in life. Its fine to so on the computer for a little but @CAPS3 off and read a book. While on the computer your not learning anything from myspace, facebook, or twitter. These sites dont help you in anyway. Your brain will start to only focus on the computer and nothing else. President @PERSON1 has made many speeches about how computers affect your knowledge. ""@CAPS3 out and play an hour a day."" Exercising is great and can be fun. Cooking with mom and playing with dad will create special bonds. Losing knowledge isn't good. Exercising, spending time with the family, and knowledge are all negative consquences when computers come into play. If you have a computer at home make sure you stay away. Go outside, read a book, or go for a hike. These will all benefit you more than being a computer bum.",10
2353,"Dear newpaper, I am writing to you to tell you why computers are good to have. Computers are good to have because they have the ability to teach people about faraway places and people. It also teachs people hand-eye coordination, and it even allows people to talk on line with other people. Now getting into my letter, computers are good because they have the ability to teach people about faraways places and people. For a social studies project a couple of years ago that I did was about the southern part of @LOCATION1 and we did it on @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION4, and we looked a lot of it on line and we learned lots of new things we didn't now before we did the project and if we didn't have computers it would be really hard to find all of that information. Now my second reason why computers are good is because they teach you the ability of hand-eye coordination. It teachs you hand-eye coordination because if you are typing a report or a paper you can watch the screen and you can type at the same time and if you watched your typing you probale mess up or hit the wrong key at the wrong time or hit a button that delets all of your work, and that would be bad all of your hard work gone, and if that happened to me I would be really upset. Now my last but not least the third reason why computers are good because they allow you to talk to your family, friends, or bisneuss coleges. My uncle moved to @LOCATION3 about six, seven years ago and I don't get to see him a lot so my dad sets up the video camera for the computers and we talk for a couple of hours just to catch up on all the things he as missed out on. So in the end computers are a good thing to have because they teach you about faraway places and people, it teaches you hand-eye coordination, and it allows you to talk to family, friends or bisneuss coleges.",8
2354,"To the local Newspaper Computers are so wired into our lives these days that without them we would be nothing. Computers are good things in our lives, they are positive machines that can help a persons communication, entertainment and one day maybe even a job. Computers are machines that if one day all disaphered, the human race would be caught on a state of confusion. Imagine life without a computer. It would not only communications from buisness to worker but also friends and family. Computers can enhance a persons learning. For a example, in schools computers are tools that are used to help with a child's learning or understanding. If I dont understand something the internet is where I go. It has everything right there for me. I can look up anything from persons of the to different animal spaces. That @MONTH1 seem lazy but the real thought is would I go out of my way t a to find one little or detail? I wouldn't have the time to do that and I don't think many other kids do either. Where would many of our classes go? Many kids are visual learners and a computer is a prime place to learn for them. For a example its much easier to see the effects of on a computer than a book. Its a lot easier to see the effects of on a than a book. Intell we find out has to put a video on a on a book, computers will be the best place to see things on action. What about on a computer. How could a student figure out where is place in a needed without a @NUM1-@CAPS1 model. A @NUM1-@CAPS1 something should look like when its finished. Then the communications. There are so many emails and it should be amazing to see then in one. How would a business notify that the. answer as a contract. Computers are would not way more than many people think. Thank you for listening to my opinions, I hope it will sway you thinking. ",8
2355,"Dear, Newspaper, @CAPS1 I think using the computer is a good thing, we are able to learn new things about places that we just cant go to. Another reason is that we can talk to our friends online. But most importantly we can know whats going on in the world. We can learn new things like the @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1, or like the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of @LOCATION2. There are so many things you can find out about places than having to get on a plane everyday to learn about the place. It is also good for reasearching for projects. this is one of the reasons why is we should use a computer. We can also talk to our friends online. lets say you have a friend that moves away and there is no way to talk to that person, with a computer you can talk to your friend still. It is also a good place to find out what homework you missed or just to talk and say hi. My last reason is that we know what is going on in the world. the computer is a @CAPS3 place to look up the news, weather, and sports. The computer keeps you up to date with the news. It also might tell you what big things people are doing like what the president does and some issues that are hapinng in the wrold today. This is why I think we should use computers.",7
2356,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have benefited society in a very good way. They can teach hand-eye coordination so that in the future you can type without having to look at the keyboard. Also you can do your home work and not have worry about your ""dog eating it"" or ""you accidently dropped it in your fire place"". It would be saved into your computer for later. @CAPS2 you need help with a class you can go to an online tutor for extra help on a school website. Computers also give you the advantage to learn about faraway places and people. You will be able to find directions to other places. For example: @CAPS2 you to find @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, travel @CAPS3 on @NUM1, turn on to the merrit parkaway and get off on exit @NUM2. Now people can learn about their great grandparents by going on websites that have your family tree. This is better than hearing stories that do not have all the information. Computers are now letting you chat online with your friends and family. You can use a webcam so you can see your friends and talk to them. Now people are playing online and you can meet your friends their and hang out. Lastly you can meet new friends around the world or even in your own town or city. All these reasons are why computers benefit today's society. We are advancing technology everyday so people can learn on computers. ",7
2357,"Dear local newspaper, Some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on their computer and less time exercising. Well people who are on the computer all day everyday is techinaly exercising by using there fingers and eyes. It's not bad for little kids because you could have a program for the kids tohem. But than you have the adluts who just on it just because. It bad for everyone because the power the money is just being wasted. Then although if people are on the computer could go to exercising programs but no it's like these couch patotos they just don't want to move. What company should do is have a limte for how long a person has been on and maybe people might do the right thing. US people think the computers are good cause we could talk to new but then people forget there family. Being on the computer could also get you in alot of trouble like for example talk to some one and then they send threats. People say that you could bring your computer everywhere well in fact thats true. Now see everyone has a laptop thats portable and these no relgure compture they could always use the laptop. Laptops are good but it still stops are problems people on it all the time if these not at home, when your out side people still on it. What a way to make these people not use the computers? Well what the companys are going to have to do is put a timer on it then there a rest button that will tax you when ever you rest it again.",8
2358,"Dear newspaper, More than @PERCENT1 of the whole world supports technology and computers. People use it in their everyday lives. Using computers benefits the soceity. I teaches everyone new skills and gives hand-eye coordination. It also gives online resources like dictionaries, encyclopedias, maps, atlases, and many others. In addition, it gives people a way to communicate and share ideas. Computers are an everyday resource and without them nobody would be as educated and without them nobody would be as educated and advanced as the world is. First of all, they teach people that they can use throughout their life. When people use the mouse to move the screen with their eyes, creating hand-eye coordination. Also, it teaches people facts an skills like to read and write. To use a computer and know how to read and write, but if they don't the computer has many programs to teach people. It also allows typing which makes writing neater and for most people can be done faster. The computer is a useful fool to teaching people everyday skills. Secondly, the computer has many online resources. It has dictionaries to look meaning or spelling of a word, the to improve vocabulary and find synonyms for words, encyclopedia to learn additional information on topic, people, places, structures, or others, and many other resources. It helps people expand their knowledge and learn information about history, people they are to meet, places they are unable to go or things they would see computers widen people knowledge and allow them to experience for themselves. Lastly, computers allow people to communicate and share information or ideas. There are many different programs that allow people to chat privately pr publicly. They have places to share opinions or ideas and places to meet people. Nowadays there are many people meeting friends online. Also, if people discover new information or have new ideas they can share it with the world in a fast easy way. Overall, computers are a useful form of communication. In conclusion, computers are useful tools that can benifit peoples everyday life and the society. They teach people newskills and supply them with new knowledge and also serve as helpful resources to find new or reinforce information. Also they are a new, modern more advanced and quicker way to share information with people all around the world. So clearly the computers are very helpful to people all around the world and they can benefit the society.",9
2359,"Dear local newspaper, I don't think that the computors benifit society. Computors take away time from; family and friends, forms obesity,and less time for excercising. As a result of, the computor, it has tooken time away from family and friends. If everybody is always on the computor everybody would be bored if they had time with their family. Also people would be bored all the time from not being on the computor. When you're on the computor you can't hang out with a friend. So, there will not be as @MONTH1 friends if everybody is on the computor @NUM1. Compared to family and friends obesity is a very very big issue in the @LOCATION1. In fact is, when you are side tracked you double the amount you normally would. A scientific fact is that when your stomach is full and you eat more than your stomach holds it will grow bigger. Obesity is caused by eating and you sometimes eat when you are doing nothing or are bored. I relize, you have read this letter so far, so I will say excercising is the @CAPS1 important thing to do in life. Even if, you are not obese you still want to excercise to keep yourself in shape. Excercising is good for you so don't delay on it. Excercising is: fun, exciting, keeps blood moving, energizing, and best of all, you can do it with friends! I have no idea about who's reading this, but I love nature! I could go outside for hours on end in the sun without stopeng. Nature is good for you and animals. Do you have a dog? Well, I know for a fact dogs love walking too. To rap this letter up I want to say, that computors definitly do not benifit society! For reasons like friends and family, obesity, and excercising.",8
2360,"Dear local newspaper, Computers benefit society and have a positive effect on people in everyday life. As a student, it helps not just me, but others with school work, learning about faraway places, and even lets you talk to friends online. Let me elaborate more on these ideas. Although you @MONTH1 think doing homework on the computer is wrong, it can be very useful. In @CAPS1 class, we have vocab every week. Instead of looking in the dictionary and searching for the definition, we could just go on the internet. It saves time and effort. Also, when you are trying to write an essay for collage, or any other reason, it would look more professinal and neat typed rather than written on lined paper. Furthermore, you can learn about exotic places and famous people you have never been to or met before. Computers give you a chance to feel that adventure! You can see pictures of famous sites and even book an flight to go there with people on the internet, you can find the newest gossip about them. Also, you can even find out where and when a famous singer is going to have a concert. As you @MONTH1 know, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 are popular chatting sites. They give people a chance to communicate. My cousin lives in @LOCATION1, so I could never see her, but because of the computer, I can catch up on special events that happened in our family. A study showed that students have better relationship with their friends than to students who don't use the computer. To sum it up, I think now you could agree that computer benefit the society. They help students with school work, let you have better knowledge of places and people, and help have a stronger connection with relatives and friends. Please take all these ideas into concideration.",9
2361,"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently heard in our school newspaper that some people think having computers is a bad idea. @PERCENT1 of computers owners say that this is not true. @NUM1 of @NUM2 graders say computers have helped them a lot. In my opinion having computers is a good idea. First, having computers is a good idea because it teaches hand-eye coordination. All the time you spend on your computer typing will benefit you. It will benefit you because while you are typing, you are also teaching yourself hand-eye coordination. This will help you later in life. And the you become better. And it is great to have excellent hand-eye coordination. Scientists did a test and the results showned that when you have better hand-eye coordination it helps with lots of things. In conclusion, having a computer is a good idea because it teaches hand-eye coordination. Secondly, having a computer is a good idea because it gives people the ability to learn about different places. For example, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 lets you see @CAPS2, @LOCATION1, the moon, and the constilations. It also has a flight simulates. On computer you can learn new languages or a sentences to any language. I remember one time when I bad to surly and do a report on a country. I was @NUM3 grade and I @CAPS3 @CAPS4. This really tought me me a lot. In conclusion having a computer is a good idea because it gives people the ability to learn about different places. Lastly, having a computer is a good idea because it allows people to chat with friends. For example, @CAPS5, I have a @CAPS6 and I have about @PERCENT2 friends on it. I spend on the @CAPS5 talking to friends. It really helps with with typing tem. On it I get in of things, and even when I am absent from school I get the homework. @PERSON1, a therapy, says that kids relieve stress when they chat online with example. In conclusion, having a computer is a good because it allows people to chat with friends. To conclusion, having a computer is a good idea. A good idea because it teaches kids hand-eye coordination. Also it gives people the ability to learn about different places. And it people to chat with friends. Hopefully this provedes you to put this is the paper. The fate as people knowledge about computers is in your hands.",9
2362,"People spend way to much time on the computers. There are many things that make people lazy and not excersize such as @CAPS1.V. to video games but I think the computer is the worst one. When people are spending their time on the computer it is turning off your brains and your bodys causing you to not wanna do things for the rest of the day. There are also ways to chat with friends online where you just sit there and type when really you could be out doing something active with that friend. Lots of kids like to play games on the computers these games can be addicting and cause kids to want to do nothing else but play there games on the computer just like how some people like to watch @CAPS1.V. the time. I do think computers are a good thing when used appropriately, teachers can use computers for grading, typing up notes for their students. Kids can also use computers for there school work such as a typed out project a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5, and @CAPS6-mailing teachers. All the time People are spending on the computer using @LOCATION1M, @CAPS7, myspace, and twitter they could be spending time with their familys, doing their favorite activities such as @CAPS8, soccer, field hockey, baseball, ice hockey, exct. or hanging out with friends. Nowadays lots of people have cell phones anyways so if it is important that they talk to someone, instead of spending all that time on the website they use they can simply call or text someone while doing something fun and active outside. Computers should be used for school work and research only because those are things you need to get done but other that that kids should rarely use the computer and get more excersize. People should cut back on how often they use computers.",9
2363,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 is a conflict going around about computers being a help in socity or hurting socity. I was told to wright a letter to my local newspaper aboutt my opinion on this argument. My opinion is that computers help socity. Computers helps socity because they teach us nit only hand-eye coordination but about abot what is happening in town or any where in the world if we didn't have computers life as we wouldn't where we are today. What mean by thout is we wouldn't know how to make life like @NUM1 diagrams to exat proportions for example when people dasign building or what not they first draw it out then they make the blue prints and final disign or the computer. Also bosness wouldn't be the way thyere because without computers @CAPS1 would be no websites with no websites computers would have to rely on newspaper and customers word. Secondly people would not know other people places. If people didnt have computers to know people @NUM2 other places @CAPS1 might be people might ask ""how is that possable"" so will explain. Computers let people interact with her and if we couldn't talk to people of her then we couldn't realy got a good or of what that place is like to go @CAPS1. Also you would have to go to the airport or call to book a ticket. With the help of computers we can book a flight online. Lastly, computers can help people get to know each other. for example, facebook, facebook lets people get to talk without a phone so you can see money on your phone bill, websites like facebook lets them communicate. Now that I stated some of the meny ways computers help, I would like to thank you for your time reading this paper.",8
2364,"Dear local newspaper, I support advances in technology. I support because people can talk online, make easy payments, and teach people. All of this can be done with one peice of advanced technology that is used all over the world. One reason is that people can talk online. You can talk to anyone you know. For example, you can talk online with far away family members, faraway friends or just friends you never get to talk to. In example, people can talk online with people the don't get to see very often using the advanced technology we have @DATE1. Another advantage with advanced technology that people have is the advantage to make easy payments online. For example, people @DATE1 shop online, pay bills online, and even pay insurance. Many people @DATE1 use the internet for making payments, seeing it as an easier way for them. As a result, making payments online is easier than doing what we did without advanced technology. Another thing people use our advanced technology for is learning. People learn how to fix a problem with their computer, how to make or build a certain thing, and even help with acedemic studies. In example, they can learn more about math, science, social studies, gramar, ect. As a result, people learn from advanced technology without having trouble understanding what they are tryin to learn. In conclusion, there are many advantages for people with the advanced technology we use @DATE1.Those advantages are talking with people from faraway, making easy payments online, and having a better learning experience.As a result, I support advanced technology because it makes peoples lives easier for them.",8
2365,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 in the late @DATE1 and has been around, ever since. It's the computer. I think that the computer has a positive effect on our society. It helps us gain more knowledge, have easier communication, and helps hand-eye coordination. In the following paragraphs I will expand on these reasons. Science, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, etc any topic you name the computer knows it. In fact it has been proven the computer itself can teach you more in one week than a three week college course! We wouldn't want to take away such a wonderful oppurtunity to expand on or knowledge,would we? My uncle an infectus disease doctor told me he has found a diganoses for many of his patients because of research he has done online. With forty percent of scientists and doctors admitting a lot of their knowledge came from the computer I think it is pretty clear how important the computer really is. It has already helped us find cures, diganoses, treatment, and much more..who knows what other areas it will one day help us in. Saying goodbye to someone you arent going to see for awhile that you love isn't any one's favorite thing to do. Luckily, with computers you don't have to! The computer offers hundreds of ways to communicate with others no matter how far away. Worldwide communication has imcreased ninety-four percent since the computer was @CAPS1! Now that's a lot! You can video chat, voice chat, email, instant massage, facebook, and, much more to communicate. The other day when my sister went back to college we missed each other so much we video chatted that very night! It was like he was practically in the room! With computers you don't have to wait on long to see or talk to the ones you miss. According to the . Today's the @CAPS3.S the top neuro suregeons in the world. Fifty percent said they thanked computers for their great hand eye coordination. Typing without looking is one of the best ways to improve your hand-eye coordination. My very own doctor told me one very important skill every surgeon must have is good hand-eye coordination. I think we have computers to thank for this. As you can see computers are very important and helpful to our society. Where would we be without them? We certainly wouldn't have as much knowledge, communication, or as good hand-eye coordination as we do today. This is why computers have a positive effect on people and our society.",9
2366,"Dear local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are an iseue. Have you ever thought that computers are eating away at the little life you have? Yes computers are good for projects and websites But these days people are using them for unnesesary purposes, such as facebook or twitter, webcams, and computer texting. So meny ways of communicating and people end up rellying on computers. I love facebook (who do eat?) and I feel it's like an extencion of school with out the learning. You get to see and talk to all your friends and play internet games to conect chatrooms and such but one of the most simple resons there on facebook and twitter in the first place is because they dont and or can't hang out with there friends at home. So if our parents would give us more freedome on school days we woulden't be online. Another ishue worth adressing is webcames I under stand if we don't want friends over but webcames is a way of being lazzy and on computers. well without webcame we get more active like walking around or playing games and with webcames you sit there and talk while & camra watches your every move. One last thing I want to tell you guys about is computer texting. If you have an e-mail, like me you can get free texting and send a mesage to any phone you want so you are texting wile your brain is stick on the computer screen. I say just call them and work up your comunication tecniqes. Well now you know why computers are such a big isue. facebook and twitter are a manet to children, webcames just watch you, and computer texting is a new low on texting so to finally solve all this all parents should let the kids have friends over a lot mote than they do now. thanks for lisining,",8

2368,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 more and more people use computers, but I think that it doesn't benefit out society. Most people believe that computers have a positive effect on people, but they don't look on the negative effects. Experts believe that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. What side are you on? Spending too much time on the computer @MONTH1 seem fun and all, but you won't @CAPS2 all the exercise you need. If you don't exercise you're most likely going to @CAPS2 love handles or a tire in your stomach. Going on the computer a lot will make you become addicted. Addiction is wehre you become dependent on it and when you want to stop, it's hard to quit. You also won't @CAPS2 enough sleep because of online chatting. Sure, it's easier to do than calling that person, but the more online chatting you do the longer you do it. You want to stay up because you want to keep talking to that person. Is this really the type of lie you want? ""@CAPS2 off the computer! Look around you! Go enjoy nature! "" is what a lot of parents say to their computer addicted kids. But really look around you outside. Nature is amazing. Going on a hike up mountain sure is hard but you'll @CAPS2 the exercise you need and the sight is amazing. Which brings me to my next point. There are more jaw-dropping things in nature than a gossip column story. Really! us kids need fresh air @CAPS1, so @CAPS2 out and play an hour a day! The last point of my opinion is you interact less with your friends and family members. Your friends will stop inviting you over because you'll seem distracted because of drama you got yourself into and they want to spend time with you not snap their fingers in front of your face. Your family an friends all want to spend time with you, but all you want to do is talk to people on the computer. You'll lose some friends becasue you interact less with them. Friends want to spend time with friends! Is this really how you want to live? Although the computer @MONTH1 be fun and easier way to access information it will always have cons. to become less addicted to it cut your hours shorter. Don't be addicted! @CAPS2 out and play! Enjoy nature!",8
2369,"Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION5. In response to the recent debate regarding the effects @ORGANIZATION1 computers on people, I believe that computers are a real benefit to society. Computers can do things that people, can't, people can learn about all sorts @ORGANIZATION1 thing, and people can communicate with others regardless @ORGANIZATION1 ther location. Computers, insome ways, are more intelligent than humas. The @ORGANIZATION3. recently had an article explaining the sudden increase in car production. The article said that the car making industry experienced a @PERCENT1 spike in production because robots programmed by computers are building cars at a greater rate than humans. Though the process the companies are making more cars thus making them cheaper for people. @PERSON3 is a proffesor @ORGANIZATION1 neurosurgery at the @ORGANIZATION1 and he belives that in @NUM1 years @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 surgeries will be conducted by robots. These machines are more preuse than humans, thust the survival rate @ORGANIZATION1 surgery will goup. Computers will probably be called upon in the future to perform tasks that are simply too difficult for humans. Computers contain an extremly vast wealth @ORGANIZATION1 information. @PERSON1 is the super @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS2 public schools and he is working on a proposal to get rid @ORGANIZATION1 the books in the libray and put computers in their place.

2370,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 regester, @CAPS3 writing this letter because I think coumputers are the besty invenstion a person as ever made. My frist reason why I think computers is the best invenstion a person has ever made because it keep kids from going outside and geting into problems. My second reason is it will hepl people learn about are country and what's going on in different countrys. My last reason is you could talk with people around the would. My first reason why computers are the best invention a person has evere made because it will keep kids from going outside and geting them selfs into problem with a on there people. I think this because in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 it all about were you from who you hang with and what you repe. For example you sure just walking in a nigberhoud and you not from there end people know you not from there they will rode you or just shout you because you are not from there that why computer is a great invention because it will keep your kid from making that mistuk. My second reason why computers are a great invention because it helps people learn more about we would and with going on in different contrys. For example you have a school project on how we got @ORGANIZATION1 and you don't know all you have to do is to tipy in that gueston and it will tell you all the answer on how we got our country end and more. My last reason why coumputers is a great invenvsoion because you could talk to people around the world with out knowing them. For example @CAPS4, myspace and more all those websites help you talk end make friend overe the wed without calling them end texting them end even make friends that live in a diffirent country and even askinf them guestion that is there country diffirent or to your country and even if it's a good place to vesit. That why we neend computers. In cunclution, @CAPS5 are great for people to have. one reason why it will help kids from going outside end geting it to problems. Second reason is it will hlep people learn more about are country end diffirent country. The last reason is you could talk to people around the world.",9
2371,"Are computers good or bad? More and more people each day are becoming addicted to the internet. Some people love it. Although, some people disagree, and are against it. Is the internet really making people go against nature? No. I, for one, think the computer is a great device. It lets you talk to friends, learn about the world, and even make new friends. Search engines like ""google"" or ""yahoo"" are a great way to find out information. Someone can look up to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, good restaurants, or even music videos. Anything you think of, the internet probably has information on it. It's almost like a personal library. One thing people love is friends. The internet is a great way to connect with friends. There's e-mail, instant messengers, and various other sites that allow you to talk to your friends. You can discuss whatever you want, without being in the same room. The possibilities are endless. Then there's other countries. The internet is a great way to find out about places you've never been to. This brings up the search engines and other people again. All you have to do is search for a certain place. Let's say you want to see what @LOCATION1 is like. Type in ""@LOCATION1,"" and you get tons of pictures and information on @LOCATION1. You can also meet people from other countries. You can talk to them, befriend them, and ask questions about their culture, language, customs, and more. The computer is a very helpful thing to have. It's not always a cure all for boredom and laziness. As for the lack of exercise, that's not the computers fault. That's the person's fault. It is possible to enjoy the internet and nature, friends, and family. You just have to want to.",8
2372,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think that computers are very useful. I think this because you can communicate with friends, find out what's going on in the world and find @CAPS1 ways to exercise. These are all things that you could do without a computer, but it's a faster way to find it. This makes more time in the day to do other activities. Friends are important to us, so we try to talk to them as much as possible. This gives us reason to talk to them. You also might be able to find friends on the internet that you might've known from high school or elementary school. This way you can see if they are married, have kids, or what they are doing for a living. As a result, you can keep in touch with them. You can find out sports scores, breaking news, laws being passed; or even @CAPS1 jobs, @CAPS1 schools, info about history. The internet has basiacally everything on there. The internet has activities for all ages: kids, teens, adults, and elderly. You can find out about good restraunts, good gyms, anything that might be advertised. As a result, the internet is also a good marketing place. Some people say that we aren't getting enough exercise. Yet, if they didn't have time to exercise they wouldn't be able to have time to work. Most people are walking around all day anyway. You cant find healthy food online, exercise equipment gyms, how to do an exercise the right way, you can find ways to cook food healthier. The internet is also used for ways to find how long an average person should be working out/exercising. As a result, people who say we don't exercise enough are wrong because they (the people using the internet) are usually using it to buy exercise products. The internet is also used to keep track of stocks, big companies, and many other features used in business. This is what some people do for a living so they sit a computer all day but they still get exercise; they are using/exercising their fingers. Therefore, they have nothing else to do until the get off their shift. Besides, most people are using their smart phones for the internet so they could be exercising and using the internet at the same time. This means that they could go on the internet anywhere and be doing something else instead of using their phone (unless they get updates).",9
2373,"I believe that computers are used way too much. Many people across the world, are becoming obese and out of shape, People are relying on the internet to contact eact other. What happens when technology fails? Also prosle are forgetting how to speak and act in the real world. Computers do many good things. most of these things are advertised, but what you don't see advertised is all the harmful things they do to you. I don't know of a person who is not sitting on their rear-end while using a computer. People are most likely on the computer for around an hour or more. So sitting down this entire time could have potential to run your posture. And cause back problems. Also when someone is on the computer they are not exerzising like they could be and should be. The average person wands to live a healthy lifestyle and look good right. Well sitting at your computer for that hour you could have been excercising is not going to help you achieve that goal. Another point I'd like to being us is that many people rely on e-mail ad internet to contact each other. Well, what happens when technology fails @CAPS1 sometime it will, And lots of people will be lost. If a sports coach cancels practice @PERSON1 for some doesn't spend or a few parents can't or don't have the opportunity to check their e-mail, they and there children will be left there wondering where everyone is, @CAPS2 is something I've noticed around me. Since students and adults talk on the internet so much, they really forget how to talk and act in society. This could pose as a major problem for a business man or spokesperson giving a speech. Or a salesman might lose a sale @CAPS1 he treated the customer with disrespect due to the fact that he just did not how to talk to the man. On the younger side of this teens use the @NUM1internet to talk a lot, when they get into a real life situation they won't know how to go about it or handle it, this making it awkward. In conclusion, I think that in a way computers are ruining society, They are a major contribution obesity and lack of exercise, they are heavely relied for communication, and lastl, they can manipulate the way you speak and act in society.",8
2374,"Computers have pro-and-con effects on our society. Many people believe that computers have a major positive effect on our country, yet some people believe that computers have a major negative effect on others. It is important to know that computers do improve hand-eye coordination and can be used for educational use. However, there needs to be some physical activities in each person's day. Each of these topics are the pros-and-cons of the debates experts discuss and argue on. Hand-eye coordination is a positive effect from computers. When a person types words up using both hands all fingers they are improving hand-eye coordination. Musicians need very good hand-eye coordination. They can't look at the notes and fingers at the same time, they need to look at the notes without checking what they are pressing. Musicians can improve their hand-eye coordination by using computers. Computers are not just for socializing or improving you typing skills. Students need to use computers for educational uses more often. As technology changes, students are expected to do well in school to open doors in the future. Doing well in school means to follow direction. Study for tests, and create good projects with good information. Students must find good information through books. However, what happens when you can't have access to books (can't drive to library, parents are too busy, library is closed, etc.)? Maybe use a computer. Retrieving information is free. You do not have to borrow a website. People are able to do their projects using a computer. This is another benefit from using computers. There are negative effects from using a computer. Over use @MONTH1 cause obesity and might keep people from doing physical activities during their day. It is important to do very little socializing and other unimportant things on a computer. The percentage of obese people has gone up. this @MONTH1 be because of the over use of technology. So it is very important to do more exercise and less unimportant things on a computer. Computer both benefit and don't benefit our society. Beneficial topics computers do are improving hand-eye coordination and educational uses. Non-beneficial topics are the over use of computers. however, computers seem to benefit our society more than they don't.",10
2375,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think that computers have been a great addition to out technology. The computer can teach @CAPS2 people, different things. This wonderful addition has a great effect on people, like how you can socialize with people. Also instead of waiting for the news to come on @CAPS1 you can almost intantly have any news you want. The computer can do @CAPS2 different things. One is that you can learn things without knowing it like hand eye coordination. Also if you have to research some one for a project you could use books. But if the person is relatively new they might not have something about them in a book. Thats where the internet comes in. Also you @MONTH1 want to plan a trip and you dont want to call the annoying automated machine. You wont have to do anything on the phone with the internet. This is how usefull the internet is. You @MONTH1 be saying most people spend too much time can the computer. And if you don't have enough self control you can get special chip that allows you on the internet for a certain amount of time. The internet is every powerful thing. You can chat with other people no matter how far away. If you both true a web cam then you could chat and even see the person even if they are on the other side of the world. There are also some sites like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 that you could socialy know whats going on with people. And if your feeling down you cold past something. Even though most people who have an can see this you will feel better about venting you feeling and less frustrated. Lets say you planned a trip to @LOCATION1. you want to know what the weather is. Instead of waiting for the @NUM1 clock news, you can go on the internet and instantly know. Something with the news if ou are impatient and heard of new news you can look up instead of baging a newspaper. The internet can have books magazines and news papers online, so that saves trees which helps the earth. The internet is an amazing thing that most people take for granted. In conclusion you man learn things knowing it and not knowing it. You are learning to type and about around the world. You my also he update with you social life and talk to people you havent seen in a while. You can also know the news when ever you want before or even often shows on @CAPS1. You can do this all with the click of a mouse!! How amazing.!",9
2376,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a huge effect on people especially teenagers. As the years go on new pc games are coming out for the computers. As kids get these games they get hooked on it then they never come out of there room. My brother had a friend who played one of these games he used to be a really fit kid but now these games changed hislife. There is this one game that come out around like @DATE1 and I saw that @NUM1 million kids play this game. Those @NUM1 million kids will have a very short life because they dont come out of there room and all they eat is junk food. This has a huge effect on them they forgot about the outside world. I worry about these kids because they are throwing there life away. But of course I cant do anything about it because I am only a thirteen year old for gosh sake!! I have some examples and I want to share them with you. I decided to go on the website and create a ten day trial. I did this because I wanted to interview someone who I start interviewing him and he says he has a @NUM3 level @NUM4's and is the highest you can go. Now he must have a great life knowing that he played this game his whole life. My second example that I like to tell you is that one of my older brothers best friend loved nature it was his favorite thing to see. Untill one day he played this game and he played it all day and all night. He didnt realize what he was doing to himself till he got on a scale and weighed himself. Finally my last example that I would like to share with you is that this game is like nicotine. This game has @NUM1 million kids playing it and it just keeps going up. Kids are forgetting how fun the out doors are. If their parents take away these kids computer they would think that there life is ending. Now that is pathectic!! In conclusion I think that this game should be banned. The only reason why I'm saying this is because I dont want these kids to end up like my brothers friend. They can live such good lives if they want to. They could start by stop playing the game and setting a grip of themselves.",8
2377,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 of people are starting to use computers. Some support the advances in technology and believe computers have a possitive role in society. Others think computers aren't that great for us. I gave this a little thought and decided to go along with the experts that say computers are bad. People who use computers spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Let me explain more about why computers have a negative effect on people. As I said, boys and girls in the @LOCATION1 that spend a lot of time on the computers don't get enough exercise. They would rather stay on the laptop than to go outside for a while and run or shoot some. Instead of getting the daily exercise they spend their day after school playing games and goind on emails and other websites. We can all assume that this is one of the many causes why children in our country are overweight and obese. If kids spent more time outside playing with friends then they would be healthier and happier people. Another reason why I think computer arent good is that people miss the beautiful nature everyday. Staying home on the internet in a closed room with no air isn't healthy for us. If there wasn't any computer then humans would go outside, enjoy the fresh air outside and notice the amazing trees, grass, and animals that are in the environment. You should look at the nature everyday and remember how beautiful it really is. However, with computers these days people are prevented from going outside and seeing everything that surrounds us. This is another factor that plays a major role with why people aren't healthy. Instead of interacting with family and friends you interact with a computer. Some people play games and get addicted to them. Soon, they start to stop going ""to work or school. Then, your parents get angry for skipping school and not getting good grades. If they keep it up students will not pass a grade and will need to stay back another year. If adults get addicted is a computer they will eventually lose their jobs and end up losing their home for not being able to pay off taxes and mortgages. They will stop talking with family and not have a strong bond anymore. The relationshop with friends will not be as strong and you will be by yourself. Some people that can't interact with their community end up being alone because of the internet. You wouldn't want people to end up like this in you family. In conclusion, I hope I have taught you many of the reasons why I strongly believe computers are not good for people. They prevent us from exercising, getting fresh air, and interacting with family and friends. More and more people use computers now and our community is breaking apart. I hope I have convinced you to agree with me and please consider to think the some way I do. ",10
2378,"Dear @CAPS1, In this @DATE1, computors are becoming more and more a part of our daily lives. It seems as though people, especially teenagers, have a fetish with this technology. Some try to claim that this as a good thing, however, people have to stop and realize that it is not. A mere twenty years ago, when children got home from school they would go outside and play until it got dark. Now children go home and stare at computor screen until their parents kick them off. This unhealthy and studies show that as the number of computors in the @LOCATION1 rises so does the number of obese children. This issue also effects adults, who spend time updating their facebook status rather than taking a walk. If people continue to use computors lengthy amounts of time, health problems will continue to grow. The excuses people concact to explain their obsessions with computors are extraordinarily fable. For instance, people say that computors help improve hand eye coordination. However, playing sports such as tennis would do the same thing, but while improving your physical at the same time. Also, many on the computors give them the chance to foreign cultures; but the truth is books or documentation recource for . Finally, people enjoy the way computors allow you to with people; but no smiley faces typed into a text box can replace the sounds of human emotion you when you talk with someone on th phone. There are a few examples of there is enjoy a alternations to computors. Humans going on the computor all time deprives us of the chance to talk with others in person. There was one woman who became so obessed with a facebook game that she neglected her family. It became so bad that she cared more about growing virtual plants than making her children dinner. Also, if your playing computor games rathen than playing with your friends, you aren't getting the socialization humans need. One day your life will flash before your eyes, is a computor screen all you really want to see?",8
2379,Well I think that using computers help some people in different ways and also it can be a fun positive hobby. But I dont think that being on a computer all day is good for you and it also can be very addicting to some people. But to me computers are fun and I think if you be on computers to much you should take a brake. And equal it out like doing other stuff or have other hobbys or even just try new things. Goin outside can be one enjoying nature can be another those are stuff you can do computers and nature sounds nice to me but I dont think banning nature or computers is good try both is my opinion.,5
2380,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some experts and some everyday people are starting to belive that computers have a negative effect on people. I do not belive this. Computers are very important. They help people learn to read write or even how to make @NUM1 equal @NUM2! There are even online colleges. Computers also help many students write an essay. I have written many essays on the computer. I even find my reaserch for an essay on the computer. A computer is an excellent source of comunication. Wether if your on facebook talking to a friend or sending an important document through e-mail. Big and smart buisness even use the internet for advertizing or to hire @ORGANIZATION1 employes. The goverment even uses @CAPS1 to post the presidents speech's if you missed them. You can also wath the super bowl doritos commercial's. Computers have many diffrent application type things. You can type a paper on microsoft word or try, to beat your dad's highscore in pinball. Computers were used to make the movie @CAPS2 one of the best movies of the year! Even I can go home and make one the most watched video on @CAPS1 on the computer. And my dad's tryingto beat my highscore in pinball. You guys at @ORGANIZATION1 use computers everyday! To write the story then post it to your website. That's why computers are good things not bad! So how would a computer have a negative effect on you if a computer tought you how to read or if you beat your dads high score in pin ball, and that at essay you wrote yea you probably typed it on a computer.",8
2382,"Ever since they were invented, computers have been growing in popularity throughout the world. First, the amount of overweight and obise people has grown dramticly in the @DATE1. This could be because they are spending to much time on their computers and not enough time exercising. Also, because of computers, everyone is not enjoying nature as much. Lastly, the computer distracts people from seeing their family and friends. Therefore, computers are not a benefit to society. People spend too much time on computers and not enough time exercising. Exercising is necisary to maintain and good health. In @LOCATION1, more peole are getting sick because they have a low imune sysytem. getting off your computers and exercising would make the world a healthier place. Next, teens don't always get the exercise they need because of computers. The aversge teen spends @PERCENT1 of his/her day on a computer. If they could cut back and exercise more, they would get the exercise that they need. Another nreason computers do not benefit society is because they limit people from enjoying nature. Sitting in a dark room with the computer as your only light is not a good way to live. Going outside and enjoying sunlight. You can enjoy nature and get and next people spend long periods of time on the computer looking at pictures of places like rainforests. Why not plan a vacation and go there? Being outside in and around nature is very enjoyable. Lastly, even if it os hard for you to stop using the computer, go outside a little bit every day. Eventually you will be able to fully enjoy nature wihtout the distraction of computers. The @DATE1 reason computers are not a benefit to society is because they cause people to spend less time with their family and friends. Some say that the computer is a good thing and allows you to socially interact with friends and family over the internet. Actually seeing them in person is much better than typing to them on a computer. Plan to have lunch together so you can spend more time with your family. Right away you will realize that this is much better than chatting to them on a computer. Over all computers have a negative effect on people. They limit the amount of exercise that people get they don't enjoy nature as much and they spend less time with family and friends. This is why computers hurt society and not help it. ",10
